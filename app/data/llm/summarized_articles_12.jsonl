In contrast, silence helps relieve stress and tension, as demonstrated by studies showing that even brief periods of silence can be more relaxing than listening to calming music.

The study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that shame evolved as a social defense mechanism, much like physical pain protects the body.

Depressed individuals may consciously or unconsciously choose to engage with stimuli that evoke sadness, such as sad images or music, even when happier alternatives are available.

Anderson advocates for leveraging established Earth-based companies experienced in heavy machinery and resource management to pioneer space commercialization technologies.

This proximity would allow for real-time problem-solving and rescue capabilities, making lunar missions a critical step toward a viable human expedition to Mars.
