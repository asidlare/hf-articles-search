This incident differs from previous offenses because it violates a fundamental human sense of decency and morality. Research shows that humans have an innate ability to distinguish right from wrong and expect apologies when moral boundaries are crossed. Sociological studies indicate that a successful apology involves acknowledging wrongdoing, expressing remorse, and asking for forgiveness. However, Trump has publicly stated he rarely apologizes as he believes he is never wrong. Psychiatrists and linguists have noted his behavior as narcissistic and lacking empathy, and he has not offered even a utilitarian or insincere apology in this case. While some may view his refusal to apologize as a sign of strength, attacking a military family is unlikely to be perceived positively by the public. The article concludes that the most effective remedy would be a sincere apology, which Trump has so far refused to offer, indicating a possible deeper issue with recognizing moral trespasses.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"donald-trump\",\n    \"politics\",\n    \"moral-boundary\",\n    \"apology\",\n    \"public-figures\",\n    \"military-families\",\n    \"psychology\",\n    \"media-criticism\"\n  ],\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"Donald Trump has offended many groups but attacking the parents of a fallen soldier crosses a deeply ingrained moral boundary.\",\n    \"Humans have an innate sense of right and wrong that drives expectations for apologies when moral lines are crossed.\",\n    \"A successful apology requires acknowledgment of wrongdoing, expression of remorse, and a request for forgiveness.\",\n    \"Trump has publicly stated he rarely apologizes because he believes he is never wrong.\",\n    \"Psychiatrists and linguists have described Trump's behavior as narcissistic and lacking empathy.\",\n    \"Trump has not offered either a sincere or utilitarian apology regarding his comments about the Khan family.\",\n    \"Refusing to apologize may be seen as strength by some, but attacking a military family is unlikely to be perceived positively by most people.\",\n    \"The best way to remedy the situation is a sincere apology, which Trump has so far refused to provide.\"\n  ]\n}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2678, "completion_tokens": 502, "total_tokens": 3180, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}

Initially, the ants form bridges on the narrow side of the gap to minimize the number of ants used. However, they then adjust the bridge position toward the wider side to shorten the overall travel distance for the colony.
