The primary cause of this bleaching is the rise in ocean temperatures due to human-induced climate change, with even a one-degree Celsius increase over several weeks triggering bleaching.

Villarreal, a founding director at the University of California, Irvine's Center for Virus Research, challenges traditional linear evolutionary models, proposing that evolution is nonlinear and that viruses operate as dynamic consortia rather than isolated entities. He argues that viruses are active organisms, comprising a significant portion of biomass and about ten percent of the human genome, and that all living habitats function within a \\\"virosphere.\\\" Villarreal critiques neo-Darwinism for its inadequacy in explaining viral persistence and symbiotic relationships, highlighting the need for new scientific language and frameworks to address the complex, conditional interactions within viral populations. He underscores the importance of viral elements in shaping genomes, embryogenesis, and evolutionary processes, noting that endogenous retroviruses contribute to gene regulation and the emergence of structures like the placenta. Villarreal also discusses resistance within the scientific community to adopting a virus-first perspective, attributing it to entrenched beliefs and political factors. He stresses that understanding life\u2019s origins and evolution requires embracing nonlinear, consortial models that account for cooperation, persistence, and group identity among RNA entities. While acknowledging challenges in communication and conceptualization, Villarreal sees growing acceptance of these ideas in Europe and Japan compared to the United States.

Scientists have long known that dung beetles use celestial cues such as the sun, moon, and Milky Way for navigation. However, the new research reveals how their brains process these cues differently depending on whether the beetle is nocturnal or non-nocturnal. Through experiments manipulating the apparent position of the sun and moon using mirrors, researchers found that both nocturnal and non-nocturnal beetles adjust their course based on the sun\u2019s position. However, only non-nocturnal beetles respond to the moon\u2019s location, while nocturnal beetles rely on detecting polarized light generated by moonlight or the Milky Way rather than the moon\u2019s position itself. This ability to sense polarized light, which humans cannot perceive, allows nocturnal dung beetles to navigate effectively even on moonless nights. The findings highlight the complexity of insect navigation and the specialized neural adaptations that support these behaviors in different environmental conditions.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"dung-beetles\",\n    \"navigation\",\n    \"insect-brains\",\n    \"polarized-light\",\n    \"nocturnal-animals\",\n    \"animal-behavior\",\n    \"neuroscience\",\n    \"celestial-navigation\"\n  ],\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"Dung beetles use celestial cues such as the sun, moon, and Milky Way to navigate while rolling dung balls.\",\n    \"Both nocturnal and non-nocturnal dung beetles adjust their navigation based on the sun's position.\",\n    \"Non-nocturnal dung beetles respond to the moon's location for navigation.\",\n    \"Nocturnal dung beetles do not rely on the moon's position but detect polarized light generated by moonlight or the Milky Way.\",\n    \"Polarized light detection enables nocturnal dung beetles to navigate even on moonless nights.\",\n    \"The brain mechanisms underlying navigation differ between nocturnal and non-nocturnal dung beetles.\",\n    \"Humans cannot see polarized light, but many insects, including dung beetles, can use it for orientation.\",\n    \"This research provides insight into how animal brains create real-world behaviors based on environmental cues.\"\n  ]\n}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2092, "completion_tokens": 490, "total_tokens": 2582, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}
