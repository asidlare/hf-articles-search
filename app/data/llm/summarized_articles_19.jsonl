These changes can include a deeper appreciation for life, new possibilities, improved relationships, spiritual growth, and increased personal strength. The process involves a fundamental challenge to one\u2019s core beliefs and assumptions, akin to an earthquake shaking the foundation of one\u2019s worldview. This disruption forces individuals to rebuild their understanding and sense of self, often leading to profound transformation. While trauma naturally brings difficult emotions such as grief and anxiety, growth occurs alongside these feelings as individuals adapt and find new meaning. The article also highlights how adversity can foster creativity by compelling people to reconsider taken-for-granted beliefs and explore new perspectives.
