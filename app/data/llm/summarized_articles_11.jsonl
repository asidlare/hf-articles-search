The researchers conducted a detailed study of 325 Hawaiian land snail species in the family Amastridae and found that 131 species are extinct, compared to only 33 listed by the IUCN.

The study analyzed ancient volcanic rocks from Baffin Island and Iceland using an ion microprobe to detect chemical traces of early water, focusing on hydrogen isotopes. The findings revealed low levels of deuterium, indicating that the water was not imported from other celestial bodies but originated from water molecules on dust particles that coalesced to form Earth.

In 2015, over half of U.S. hospitals faced these penalties, totaling $420 million. However, a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, conducted by Harvard Medical School researchers, reveals that many readmissions are influenced by patient characteristics such as socioeconomic status, race, education, and disability, which are not fully accounted for in the current penalty system. These factors explain nearly half the variation in readmission rates between hospitals. Critics argue that hospitals serving poorer and sicker populations are unfairly penalized, which the study supports by showing that adjusting for these factors significantly reduces the disparity between high- and low-performing hospitals. This misalignment may discourage hospitals from admitting high-risk patients and reduce resources for those serving vulnerable populations. The study suggests that Medicare could improve fairness by incorporating more patient factors already present in health records and shifting the evaluation toward measuring hospitals' year-over-year improvement in reducing readmissions.
