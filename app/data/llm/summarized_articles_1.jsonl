The teenage brain is in a critical developmental phase where the frontal lobes, responsible for decision-making, impulse control, and judgment, mature last. This developmental lag results in heightened emotional responses and risk-taking behaviors, as the limbic system, which governs emotions and rewards, is more active than the frontal lobes during adolescence. Contrary to popular belief, hormones play a lesser role in mood swings compared to this brain imbalance. Jensen also highlights that teenagers' brains are more vulnerable to the negative effects of substances like alcohol, marijuana, and drugs, which can disrupt synaptic development and cause lasting damage. Additionally, overprotective parenting styles, such as helicopter parenting, may hinder teens' ability to make decisions and learn from mistakes, potentially leading to learned helplessness. Jensen advises parents to allow teenagers to experience trial and error to foster brain development and decision-making skills.

This concept, known as the baby schema, was first studied by ethologist Konrad Lorenz in the 1940s. However, as children grow beyond infancy and their physical cuteness diminishes, they adopt new strategies to maintain adult attention and care. A group of Spanish scientists identified that children aged two to seven exhibit \\\"cognitive babyness,\\\" characterized by immature thinking patterns such as animism and finalism, which adults find endearing and which elicit caregiving responses. These cognitive traits involve attributing human-like qualities or purposes to inanimate objects and natural phenomena, often involving supernatural or magical explanations. Experiments showed that adults rated children displaying such immature supernatural thinking more positively and as more helpless compared to those demonstrating mature cognition. Interestingly, these cognitive cues were more influential than facial appearance in evoking adult care. This effect was consistent across genders, parental status, and cultures in the United States and Spain. The positive adult response to cognitive babyness diminishes after puberty, aligning older adolescents' reactions with those of adults. While children who are less cute physically or cognitively may face some early social challenges, various forms of babyness continue to provoke protective instincts in adults.
