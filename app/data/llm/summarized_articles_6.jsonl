The study revealed that instead of individual neurons, a complex interaction among many neurons forms an \\\"attentional map\\\" that signals where attention is allocated within fractions of a second. Using macaque monkeys, the researchers recorded brain activity as the animals focused on visual targets while ignoring distractions. A computer decoder was able to predict where the monkeys were focusing their attention even before they shifted their gaze or encountered distractions. Manipulating neural interactions in this region could induce focused or distracted states, suggesting that proper attention requires a balanced interaction among neurons. These findings have implications for understanding attention disorders such as ADHD, autism, and schizophrenia, where this neural balance may be disrupted.

Researchers found that the presence of this subsurface ocean explains the unusual positioning and geological features of Sputnik Planitia, including Pluto's rotation and crustal cracks. Despite Pluto's great distance from the Sun, it retains enough internal radioactive heat from its formation to maintain liquid water beneath its surface. While Pluto's ocean is not considered a prime candidate for life due to its icy cover and extreme conditions, scientists remain cautious about ruling out the possibility entirely. This finding adds Pluto to a growing list of solar system bodies believed to have underground oceans, expanding our understanding of where liquid water and potentially habitable environments may exist beyond Earth.

This shift in immune response is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation to perceived hostile environments. The study analyzed gene regulation in 141 older adults over five years and in socially isolated rhesus macaque monkeys, finding increased inflammatory gene activity and decreased antiviral gene activity in lonely subjects. In monkeys, loneliness also induced stress responses that impaired antiviral defenses, leading to faster viral growth when infected. These findings support previous research linking social isolation to a higher risk of premature death, particularly in older adults.

Key legislative efforts included the anticipated release of the 21st Century Cures draft, reflecting bipartisan cooperation aimed at addressing systemic issues in medical research. The upcoming Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VI) negotiations were expected to build on previous patient-focused initiatives, emphasizing regulatory science and accelerated approval mechanisms. The FDA's record number of new drug approvals in 2014 highlighted a surge in innovation, especially in orphan drugs and biologics, but raised concerns about the sustainability of high-cost therapies and the need for clear value assessment frameworks. Patient-centered research was gaining momentum, with increased emphasis on integrating patient input into clinical development and regulatory decisions, supported by organizations like PCORI and FDA's device center. The success of venture philanthropy, exemplified by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's lucrative investment in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, demonstrated the power of patient-driven funding models. Novel financing mechanisms, including social impact bonds and debt instruments, were emerging as potential solutions to funding gaps in early-stage research. Collaboration across sectors was expanding, though measuring the effectiveness of such partnerships remained a challenge. Academic research institutions were under financial pressure, necessitating a reevaluation of their sustainability amid funding constraints.

The studies showed that self-control was as strong or stronger a predictor of employment outcomes as intelligence. Furthermore, individuals with poor self-control were especially vulnerable to job loss during economic recessions, with their unemployment rates spiking more than those with higher self-discipline.

He attributes much of the problem to pharmaceutical companies, whose market-driven, often shoddy research dominates the field. Additionally, scientists may manipulate data, medical journals tend to favor positive results from flawed studies, and journalists often accept claims uncritically. Frances discusses the limitations of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which, despite being the gold standard in evidence-based medicine, can be biased and fail to reveal drug harms effectively. He critiques the current system where drug companies design and conduct trials, leading to conflicts of interest and underreporting of adverse effects. While acknowledging the flaws of anecdotal clinical observation, Frances argues that RCTs must be improved rather than discarded, advocating for independent, transparent trials funded by taxes on drug companies. The article also includes a debate with Dr. David Healy, who criticizes the reliance on RCTs and suggests that many modern drugs have lower efficacy and higher risks compared to earlier medications discovered through clinical observation.
