This tap dancing appears to complement their known singing and bobbing behaviors during courtship and may serve to produce additional sounds or convey signals through multiple sensory modalities. The study, published in Scientific Reports, highlights that this behavior is unique to cordon bleus among Estrildid finches and is unusual because both sexes exhibit it equally, unlike typical sexual displays where males are more ornamented. While the exact purpose and reception of the tap dancing remain unclear, the findings open new avenues for understanding multimodal communication in songbirds.

These interactions can destabilize planetary orbits, causing significant and unpredictable climate variations over thousands of years. Researchers at the University of Washington used computer models to simulate solar systems with planets in different orbital planes and with orbital periods in integer ratios, leading to repeated gravitational perturbations. These perturbations can cause orbits to shift dramatically, even flipping entirely before returning to their original state, resulting in unstable climates that could hinder the development or sustainability of life.
