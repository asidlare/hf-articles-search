Improper handling of contact lenses can lead to serious health issues because contacts interfere with the natural antimicrobial properties of tears that protect the cornea. The article shares several key tips from the American Chemical Society's Reactions series to ensure safe contact lens use: never expose contacts to water, allow the contact lens case to air-dry completely when not in use, always use fresh solution for storing lenses, and rub the lenses each time they are cleaned and rinsed. These recommendations aim to maintain eye health and prevent infections associated with improper contact lens care.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"contact-lenses\",\n    \"eye-care\",\n    \"health\",\n    \"science\",\n    \"hygiene\"\n  ],\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"About ninety-nine percent of U.S. adults who wear contact lenses do not care for them properly.\",\n    \"Improper contact lens care can lead to serious health consequences due to interference with the eye's natural defenses.\",\n    \"Tears have antimicrobial properties that help protect the cornea, which can be compromised by contact lenses.\",\n    \"Contact lenses should never be exposed to water to avoid contamination.\",\n    \"Contact lens cases should be allowed to air-dry completely when not in use to prevent bacterial growth.\",\n    \"Fresh solution must be used every time contacts are stored in their case to maintain hygiene.\",\n    \"Rubbing contact lenses during cleaning and rinsing is essential for effective removal of debris and microbes.\"\n  ]\n}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1508, "completion_tokens": 347, "total_tokens": 1855, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_658b958c37"}}, "error": null}

Drawing inspiration from the biblical King Solomon, who was renowned for wisdom yet made poor personal decisions, psychologist Igor Grossmann investigates this phenomenon through experimental studies. Grossmann defines wisdom as pragmatic reasoning that involves transcending egocentric perspectives by acknowledging the limits of one's knowledge, considering others' viewpoints, and recognizing the fluidity of situations. His research involved participants reflecting on scenarios of infidelity either in their own relationships or those of friends. Results showed that individuals reasoned more wisely about others' problems due to psychological distance. Importantly, when participants deliberately adopted a third-person perspective on their own issues, their wise reasoning improved to levels comparable with reasoning about others. Additionally, Grossmann's studies found that wisdom does not necessarily increase with age, as older and younger adults demonstrated similar levels of wise reasoning in personal conflicts.

Risk-taking behavior is also contagious; studies show that observing others engage in financial risks increases the likelihood of taking similar risks oneself. Laughter is highly contagious, with the brain responding to laughter sounds by prompting us to join in, even without understanding the context. Smiling and frowning are contagious through facial mimicry, allowing us to empathize by mirroring others' expressions.
