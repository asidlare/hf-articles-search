The mirror test, developed in 1970 by psychologist Gordon Gallup Jr., involves marking an animal with a visible dye and observing if it inspects the mark in a mirror, indicating self-recognition. While chimpanzees, orangutans, dolphins, elephants, and magpies have passed this test, many species including dogs have not. The article argues that the mirror test is visually based and may not be suitable for dogs, who primarily rely on their sense of smell rather than sight. Researchers like Alexandra Horowitz and Marc Bekoff have conducted experiments using dogs' urine with added scents to test if dogs recognize changes in their own scent, analogous to the mirror test. Dogs spent more time sniffing their own urine when it was altered, suggesting they notice changes in their olfactory 'reflection.' However, this behavior may reflect interest in novelty rather than true self-recognition. The research highlights the importance of designing cognition tests that align with an animal's sensory world. Ultimately, dogs may possess a rudimentary sense of self and theory of mind, but these abilities exist on a spectrum rather than as a binary presence or absence.

This adjustment implies that Homo floresiensis may have coexisted with modern humans, who traveled through the Indonesian archipelago en route to Australia. The findings are based on new analyses of fossilized bones and stratigraphic evidence from the Liang Bua cave, where the species was first discovered in 2003. These fossils date between 100,000 and 60,000 years old, though it remains uncertain if the species survived beyond 50,000 years ago. The \\\"hobbits\\\" were about 3.5 feet tall with small brains comparable in size to chimpanzees, yet their brain structure suggests some reorganization. Researchers continue to explore whether Homo floresiensis encountered modern humans or other hominins like Denisovans.

By directing laser beams at star systems at precise times, they suggest it is feasible to conceal Earth's transit signal with a 30-megawatt laser operating for ten hours annually, an energy consumption comparable to powering about seventy homes for a year.

Critics argue that since planets are common, lasers would need to target thousands of stars, and the method would only work if alien detection technology matches ours. Additionally, more advanced civilizations might easily detect or circumvent such cloaking efforts.
