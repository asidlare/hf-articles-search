The exact mechanism behind this damage is unclear but may involve hormonal disruption or digestive blockage. Microplastics enter oceans primarily through wastewater from personal care products, and because their size resembles the phytoplankton oysters normally consume, oysters ingest them unknowingly. This contamination threatens not only oysters but other marine bivalves that filter feed similarly.
