The researchers hypothesized that these perceptual biases might contribute to the development of social biases later in childhood. To test this, they created racially ambiguous faces by blending African and Asian features and showed these images to Chinese children aged four to six. Initially, the children associated happy expressions with Asian faces and severe expressions with African faces, reflecting their own biases. However, after a session where the children learned to identify individual African faces by name, their bias towards their own ethnic group significantly decreased.

The study involved capturing 26 leopard sharks near La Jolla, California, temporarily impairing the sense of smell in 11 of them, and releasing all sharks about five and a half miles offshore. To prevent the sharks from retracing their steps, researchers masked geomagnetic cues and moved the boat in figure-eight patterns. After four hours, sharks with an unimpaired sense of smell moved approximately 62 percent closer to shore, following relatively straight paths, while those with impaired smell only moved 37 percent closer and followed more erratic routes. This indicates that sharks rely heavily on detecting chemical gradients in the water for navigation. Sharks possess specialized nostrils lined with cells sensitive to dissolved chemicals and have enlarged olfactory bulbs in their brains, enabling them to detect extremely small concentrations of chemicals.
