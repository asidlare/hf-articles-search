Among these new planets, ten are similar in size to Earth and located within their stars' habitable zones, potentially allowing for liquid water. The Kepler Mission, launched in 2009, dramatically increased the number of known exoplanets, enabling astronomers to study their types and distribution across the galaxy. Contrary to the simple classification of planets in our Solar System as either terrestrial or gas giants, Kepler revealed a diverse range of planets, including hot gas giants orbiting close to their stars, planets around binary stars, and a large population of super-Earths\u2014planets with sizes between Earth and Neptune for which no Solar System analog exists. A significant finding from the catalogue is a gap in the size distribution of super-Earths, suggesting a division between rocky planets and gaseous mini-Neptunes. This division aligns with density measurements indicating that planets larger than about 1.6 Earth radii possess thick atmospheres. However, Kepler's data cannot determine the surface conditions or atmospheres of these planets, leaving questions about their habitability unanswered. The mission's legacy lies in demonstrating that planets are common around stars and exist in a wide variety of forms. Although Kepler's primary mission ended in 2013 due to mechanical failures, it continues as the K2 mission, and future missions like TESS, JWST, and Ariel aim to further explore these worlds and their environments. The Kepler catalogue thus serves as a roadmap for future studies to understand the nature of alien planets.\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"kepler-mission\",\n    \"exoplanets\",\n    \"astronomy\",\n    \"space-exploration\",\n    \"super-earths\",\n    \"habitable-zone\",\n    \"planetary-science\",\n    \"nasa\"\n  ],\n  \"key_insights\": [\n    \"The Kepler Mission catalogue lists over four thousand exoplanets, including more than two hundred new discoveries.\",\n    \"Ten newly discovered exoplanets are Earth-sized and located within their stars' habitable zones, making them potential candidates for hosting liquid water.\",\n    \"Kepler's discoveries reveal a diverse range of planet types beyond the traditional terrestrial and gas giant categories found in our Solar System.\",\n    \"Super-Earths, planets with sizes between Earth and Neptune, are the most common type found, yet their exact nature remains uncertain.\",\n    \"A notable gap in the size distribution of super-Earths suggests a division between large rocky planets and gaseous mini-Neptunes.\",\n    \"Planets larger than approximately 1.6 Earth radii likely have thick, Neptune-like atmospheres based on bulk density measurements.\",\n    \"Kepler data alone cannot determine surface conditions or atmospheric composition, limiting assessments of habitability.\",\n    \"The mission demonstrated that planets are common around stars and exist under a wide variety of conditions.\",\n    \"After mechanical failures ended its primary mission, Kepler continues as the K2 mission, discovering additional exoplanets.\",\n    \"Future missions such as TESS, JWST, and Ariel will build on Kepler's findings by probing the atmospheres and environments of exoplanets.\"\n  ]\n}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2879, "completion_tokens": 683, "total_tokens": 3562, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_6f2eabb9a5"}}, "error": null}
