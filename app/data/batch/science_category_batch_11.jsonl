Trash-Talking Stephen Hawking Takes On Paul Rudd In Quantum Chess \"I will crush you like an ant, man\" By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Jan 28, 2016, 05:51 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Only in this goofy alternate universe would renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking accept a challenge from actor Paul Rudd to play quantum chess. (It's complicated.) A new video, above, of the two squaring off in a match is a hoot. \"I'll crush you like an ant, man,\" Hawking warns in one of many feisty disses. Rudd calls his opponent \" Eddie Redmayne .\" Advertisement The match plays out with the fate of humanity on the line and draws comments from bigs like the pope and the president. For extra gravitas, Keanu Reeves narrates. The video was presented at a CalTech event on quantum science , the school noted. Watch the video all the way through for a fun cameo by the familiar face who directed the short. Hint: He shared an excellent adventure with Reeves back in the day.

Our Extinction Problem May Be Far, Far Worse Than We Think New research suggests that 130,000 species are gone forever. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Aug 11, 2015, 02:15 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Kenneth A. Hayes The sharp decline of land snail species in Hawaii may have frightening implications for the extinction rates of animals worldwide. A multinational team of researchers argue that because the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List -- often cited as the authority on extinct and endangered species worldwide -- does not look at most invertebrates, it presents a skewed picture of extinction rates, portraying them as much lower than they are. Advertisement \"The focus on birds and mammals and the proportionately negligible assessment of invertebrates masks a real crisis,\" the researchers write in a paper published in the journal Conservation Biology in July. Fewer than 1 percent of invertebrates worldwide have even been evaluated by the IUCN. Yet invertebrates constitute 95 to 99 percent of animal species , including insects, worms, snails and crustaceans -- meaning there's a lot of species that haven't been assessed. The researchers note that the IUCN standards for evaluating invertebrate species are so stringent that assessing many of them is virtually impossible -- a problem that\u2019s been pointed out by other scientists in the past. Advertisement In order to estimate the gap between extinction rates reported by the IUCN and real extinction rates, the researchers set out to conduct their own comprehensive survey of 325 known Hawaiian land snail species in the family Amastridae and compare their findings with the numbers listed by the IUCN. While the IUCN cites 33 Hawaiian Amastridae species as extinct, the newer study concludes there are 131 extinct Amastridae species. Extinction rates haven\u2019t been constant, researchers say, but have risen in connection with periods of habitat destruction and introductions of invasive species by humans. In a study published in June , some of the same researchers had partnered with other scientists around the world to calculate that around 10 percent of a sample of 200 known land snail species worldwide had gone extinct. Of these 200 species, only nine had been evaluated on the IUCN Red List, and three of those nine were extinct. Advertisement The earlier group of scientists extrapolated from those data to estimate that 130,000 species worldwide may have gone extinct since around the year 1600, as opposed to the 800 species recognized by the IUCN. Robert Cowie, a University of Hawaii researcher who worked on both studies, told The Huffington Post that although the new estimate may not be precise, it nevertheless suggests that \"the real number of extinct species is far, far greater than that assessed as such by the IUCN.\" \"It's a bit of a leap of faith, I admit,\" he told The Washington Post . \"We just have to wave our arms around and say that's the best we can do.\" Advertisement He also told the Post that the intention was not to make the IUCN look bad. \"We're not criticizing IUCN, they're not set up to estimate the number of species,\" he told the Post. \"The point of the paper is to say, the vast, vast majority of invertebrates has not been assessed.\" Contact the author of this article at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.com. CORRECTION: The story previously misstated when a study of land snail species worldwide was published. It was published in June. The story has also been clarified to note that a second study looked at Hawaiian land snail species specifically in the family Amastridae.

NASA Successfully Attaches Inflatable Room To International Space Station If successful, the modules would offer lightweight and cost-saving habitations. Reuters Apr 17, 2016, 04:23 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A NASA ground-control team on Saturday used a robot arm to unpack an expandable module and attach it to the International Space Station, setting the stage for a novel test of a habitat for astronauts, researchers and even tourists. The 3,100-pound (1,400 kg) module, manufactured and owned by Bigelow Aerospace, was launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule that reached the station on Sunday. Advertisement The module was attached to the station at 5:36 am EDT (0936 GMT) as the station flew about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, the U.S. space agency said during a live broadcast on NASA TV. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, is scheduled to be inflated with air in late May, beginning a two-year experiment to see how it holds up in the harsh environment of space. Advertisement Made of impact-resistant, Kevlar-like materials and other fabrics, the lightweight habitats could save millions of dollars in launch costs compared with metal modules. They may also offer better radiation protection for astronauts, officials with NASA and Bigelow Aerospace said before the April 8 launch. Bigelow, based in North Las Vegas, Nevada, tested two unmanned prototypes a decade ago, but BEAM is its first inflatable that will host astronauts. The company, owned by real estate billionaire Robert Bigelow, is working on operational modules 20 times larger than BEAM, which is about the size of a small bedroom. Dubbed the B330, it is designed primarily to be free-floating habitat, but Bigelow is talking with NASA about attaching one to the space station. It would add about 12,000 cubic feet, or 30 percent more space, to the outpost to support NASA and commercial projects. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) is displayed during a media event in 2013. NASA NASA / Reuters Advertisement The company is developing time-share agreements to lease space aboard the module to commercial entities, research organizations and the occasional space tourist. \u201cOur hope is that NASA would be the primary customer for that structure,\u201d Bigelow said at a press conference on Monday at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. NASA is interested in expandable habitats to serve as crew living quarters during three-year trips to and from Mars. BEAM's test run is intended to see how it withstands the temperature swings and high-radiation environment of space. Members of the station crew also will install sensors to monitor orbital debris and micrometeoroid impacts. \u201cThis type of architecture has never been flown before,\u201d Bigelow told reporters before launch. \"We\u2019re not 100 percent sure of its behavior. It is a testing station. That is the whole point here, in all respects,\u201d Bigelow said.

NASA's New Horizons Snaps First Full-Color Image Of Pluto As It Rapidly Approaches The Dwarf Planet This Is The First Ever Full-Color Image Of Pluto By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 16, 2015, 01:44 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This is the first full-color image ever taken of Pluto: The image -- which shows the dwarf planet and its largest moon, Charon (lower left) -- was snapped on April 9 by NASA\u2019s New Horizons, a space probe which is fast nearing Pluto. Taken from a distance of about 71 million miles, the image reveals \" tantalizing glimpses of [the Pluto] system ,\" said Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, per Space.com. The first spacecraft in history to visit Pluto, New Horizons was launched in January 2006 . As Reuters notes, it\u2019s currently about three months away from a \u201cclose encounter\u201d with the celestial body. Advertisement The probe, said to be the fastest spacecraft ever launched , will pass about 7,750 miles from Pluto\u2019s surface on July 14. It will not put itself into orbit around the dwarf planet, but will instead make observations as it flies by. \"Scientific literature is filled with papers on the characteristics of Pluto and its moons from ground based and Earth orbiting space observations, but we\u2019ve never studied Pluto up close and personal,\u201d said NASA astronaut John Grunsfeld, per a news release this week. \u201cIn an unprecedented flyby this July, our knowledge of what the Pluto system is really like will expand exponentially and I have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries.\" Learn more about NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission here .

Knobby-Faced Beast May Be Earliest Known To Stand Tall On All Fours Scientists say this prehistoric reptile was unlike any other on the supercontinent Pangea. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Sep 18, 2015, 08:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Artist's rendering of Bunostegos , a cow-sized, plant-eating reptile that roamed the ancient central desert of Pangea more than 250 million years ago. Marc Boulay Dogs do it. Cats do it. Pigs, cows, and hippos, too. But a new study suggests that the earliest known animal to have walked upright on all fours was a bizarre \"pre-reptile\" that lived some 260 million years ago. Dubbed Bunostegos akokanensis , the prehistoric plant-eater was the size of a cow, and walked like a cow. But its face was studded with big bony knobs. Advertisement Paleontologists first identified the B. akokanensis in 2003 after discovering a fossilized skull in the Sahara Desert of northern Niger. Now scientists have concluded that Bunostegos stood on all fours with its bulky body raised off the ground--unlike any other animal that roamed the supercontinent Pangea at the time. (Story continues below image.) About the same size as a cow, this pre-reptile also stood the same way \u2014 upright with its legs underneath. It may be the earliest known creature to do so, according to a new study. Morgan Turner \"We don\u2019t see upright posture, with the legs underneath the body, in both the forelimb and the hindlimb in a single animal until much later, in mammals and in dinosaurs,\" Morgan Turner, a Ph.D. student at Brown University in Rhode Island and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \" Bunostegos is much further back on the evolutionary tree than anything else that exhibits this posture [and] hints at a larger story about posture and locomotion evolution... The anatomy of Bunostegos is unexpected, illuminating, and tells us we still have much to learn.\" Advertisement For the study, the researchers examined fossilized Bunostegos bones including those of the shoulder, the elbow, the forelimb bone known as humerus and another forelimb bone known as the ulna. The researchers found that the hip joint in the hind limbs and the bones that make up the forelimbs had features seen only in upright animals. \"Aspects of the anatomy of the shoulder and the forelimb indicate that the humerus could not have jutted out in a 'sprawling' posture,\" Dr. Linda Tsuji, contract assistant curator at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email, \"and in Bunostegos we see limited motion at the elbow joint, which is an indication of upright posture in other animals.\" Walking upright on all fours may have allowed Bunostegos to travel long distances--an ability that might have helped it survive the central desert of Pangea where it lived, Turner said. Advertisement \"Here's this big, cow-sized animal in this very arid region,\" Dr. Nick Fraser, vertebrate paleontologist at the National Museums of Scotland , who was not involved in the study, told The Huffington Post in a telephone interview. \"You don't think of big herbivores in arid regions. What was going on there? Do we really understand what the climate was?... The more we learn about this creature, the more we will learn about what appears to be an isolated environment in the center of Pangea.\" The study was published Sept. 11 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology , If you thought Bunostegos was wild, check out the \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" episode below for five prehistoric mammals that were equally monstrous. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Will 'Smart Drugs' Soon Sweep the Nation? If you haven't heard of the term \"biohacking\", you may already be being outcompeted by those who have. A biohacker has generally been defined as someone who aims to gain control over their own biology. By Bobby Azarian, Contributor Neuroscientist, Journalist (www.bobbyazarian.com) Neuroscientist, Journalist (www.bobbyazarian.com) Apr 17, 2015, 06:23 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

If you haven't heard of the term \"biohacking\", you may already be being outcompeted by those who have. A biohacker has generally been defined as someone who aims to gain control over their own biology. Many biohackers are now choosing to take brain enhancing substances -- or \"nootropics\" -- that supposedly allow you to tailor your brain to fit your needs, rather than letting your brain control you. In fact, so many tech gurus and entrepreneurs swear by smart drugs that it prompted CNN to run the story \"Are Smart Drugs Driving Silicon Valley?\" Some of us with an unrelenting hunger for success have tried cognitive-enhancing prescription stimulants, such as Adderall and Ritalin, in order to pull work-filled all-nighters while the competition sleeps. While these drugs undoubtedly boost focus for long stretches of hours, this state is always and without a doubt followed by a crash -- a down period characterized by mental sluggishness, anxiety, mild depression, and a general feeling of being cracked out. Advertisement Due to this crash, along with some scary side effects and the strong potential for addiction, many have chosen to opt for natural cognitive-enhancing alternatives. Natural nootropics are brain supplements that contain organic ingredients that allegedly elevate mental function by improving attention, memory, mood, and motivation through increasing neurotransmitter levels. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that allow the brain's neurons to communicate with each other through electrical signals, and the optimal balance of transmitters is required for healthy brain function. Nootropics are thought to restore and maintain this balance without the harmful side effects, and they are already causing a feeding-frenzy amongst investors who are looking to start companies before the wave crests. One such company is the Silicon Valley-based startup known as Nootrobox, which offers a subscription service that will deliver brain supplements to your door each month. With two distinct nootropic formulas, Nootrobox offers options that are said to allow you to customize your brain states to suit particular tasks. This is a progression from the one-size-fits-all approach taken by many nootropics companies in the past, and it is likely that we will continue to see more products that target very specific cognitive functions. While some would be quick to point out that nootropic users could merely be experiencing placebo effects, well-established ingredients like caffeine, and L-theanine -- an amino acid that research has shown to increase levels of serotonin and dopamine -- make it hard to argue the efficacy of Nootrobox's nootropics. But it is definitely important to approach nootropic products with a skeptical eye, as many ingredients that are being used today have hardly no empirical evidence from credible peer-reviewed journals to support their effectiveness. Advertisement Nootrobox recently ran a successful Indiegogo campaign named \"Declaring War On Adderall\" to raise money for their new \"Sprint\" formula, which is supposed to be a safe, cheap, and legal alternative to one of the most abused drugs on Ivy League campuses. It will certainly be interesting to see whether nootropics will ever become mainstream enough to cause a measurable decline in the use of illegal uppers at these competitive schools. Of course, if we believed that a pill really could enhance mental performance, we would expect there to be some really successful pill-popping people out there. Although these smart drugs have yet to blow up in general society, some noteworthy public advocates of nootropics who use them religiously are: 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

With 20 honorary PhDs, a host of game-changing inventions, and five national best-selling books, he is arguably the most productive man in the world. The \"ultimate thinking machine\" and \"the restless genius\", as described by Forbes and The Wall Street Journal , takes a daily regimen of over 100 supplements -- a good portion that are devoted to cognitive enhancement and brain health. The fact that a scientist of his caliber is an open advocate for nootropics lends to their credibility. Podcast host Joe Rogan, an avid nootropic enthusiast, says he's often experienced super vivid and trippy lucid dreams when taking them before bed. While this may not be the first goal for someone looking to optimize their mental performance, being able to explore exotic states of consciousness would be a pretty awesome bonus. Hacking your biology and brain by tracking its activity -- through things like wristbands and smartphone apps -- and using that information to devise an appropriate nootropic routine could soon be commonplace for entrepreneurs, computer programmers, college students, and competitive athletes seeking the highest success. And why wouldn't it? Being able to focus longer, access memory more easily, speak more fluently, and execute daily tasks with ease are qualities that virtually everyone could benefit from. Advertisement The folks at Nootrobox say they believe that nootropics will be \"widely available in 7-11s, classrooms, and workplaces within a few years\". If they do prove to have the same cognitive enhancing effects as stimulants but without all the negatives, then I sure hope they are right.

Ridiculously Cute Polar Bear Cub Makes A Splash With Public Debut Go, Nora! By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Apr 17, 2016, 03:42 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING It seems like only yesterday that we were cooing over newborn polar bear Nora . But here she is, just over five months later, making her public debut at Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Powell, Ohio. And what a change! She's no longer the helpless critter who struggled to stay awake. She's now a bold and fearless polar bear -- who can swim, run and jump just like any other. Advertisement The courageous cub even knows how to belly-flop into the water in pursuit of a toy: The zoo posted footage of her playful Friday debut, witnessed by 1,000 people, to Facebook and YouTube . The videos are now going viral. Visitors can see Nora every day for one hour from 9:30 a.m., zoo officials said: \"Viewing times are based on her health and well-being and will be expanded as she grows bigger and stronger.\" Advertisement Born on Nov. 6, 2015, Nora weighed just 1 pound. She is now over 50 times heavier . A previous Facebook post detailed how the zoo's animal care staff were hand-rearing the cub after her mother, Aurora, stopped caring for her . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Scan 100,000 Galaxies And See No Signs Of Alien Life. What Do E.T. Hunters Say Now? Scientists Scan 100,000 Galaxies But Find No Evidence Of Alien Life By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 15, 2015, 09:06 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Just how realistic is it to believe that humans will someday find evidence of extraterrestrial life? NASA's chief scientist recently predicted that we'd find signs of life beyond Earth within a decade or so, but a new study by researchers at Penn State -- one of the most exhaustive of its type -- isn't very encouraging. After surveying tens of thousands of galaxies surrounding our own Milky Way galaxy, the scientists turned up no sign of advanced alien civilizations. \"These galaxies are billions of years old, which should have been plenty of time for them to have been filled with alien civilizations, if they exist ,\" Dr. Jason T. Wright, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the university's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds and one of the researchers, said in a written statement. \"Either they don't exist, or they don't yet use enough energy for us to recognize them.\" Advertisement Turning up the heat. For the research, Wright and his colleagues analyzed a vast catalog of observations made in 2010 by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope. The team looked at the heat emitted by the 100,000 \"most promising\" candidates of the all-sky catalog 's nearly 100 million entries. \"The idea behind our research is that, if an entire galaxy had been colonized by an advanced spacefaring civilization, the energy produced by that civilization's technologies would be detectable in mid-infrared wavelengths -- exactly the radiation that the WISE satellite was designed to detect for other astronomical purposes,\" Wright said in the statement. The hypothesis that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat was first put forth by renowned theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, according to Space.com. Advertisement Time to give it up? Despite his negative findings, Wright said his study, published April 15 in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, was \"just the beginning,\" and that further research may yet turn up evidence of alien technology. And other experts involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) told The Huffington Post that they're far from discouraged. Dr. Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., told HuffPost Science in an email that it's possible alien civilizations are hard to detect because they use much less energy than Dyson proposed. Advertisement \"The limits reported in this study rule out the most extreme environmental impact possible for an extraterrestrial civilization that harvests a significant fraction of the starlight in its host galaxy,\" he said. \"For comparison, our civilization processes only a thousandth of a trillionth of the energy output of the sun. Less visible civilizations are much more likely to exist, both in terms of the technological feasibility of energy harvesting as well as in terms of their energy needs.\" Legendary astronomer Dr. Jill Tarter , the former director of the Center for SETI Research in Mountain View, Calif. and the astronomer on whom Jodie Foster's character in the 1997 film \"Contact\" was loosely based, agreed that efforts to find extraterrestrial life should continine. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Find New Clues In Old Mystery Of How Earth Got Its Water Water may have been a part of our planet's history since the beginning. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Nov 14, 2015, 07:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT New research suggests that our planet Earth has had water since it was formed. DonkeyHotey/Flickr About three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered with water . But how did it get there? While some scientists believe water was delivered by icy space rocks smashing into the planet after it was formed, others have argued that water has been on Earth since its formation -- and new research indicates they might be right. An international team of scientists has found new evidence that water may have been a fundamental part of Earth since its beginning some 4.5 billion years ago. Advertisement \"Our data suggest that the majority of Earth's water was sourced from water molecules stuck to the surface of dust particles,\" Dr. Lydia Hallis, the earth scientist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland who led the research, told The Huffington Post. \"These dust particles eventually accreted together to form the Earth. So the planet's water was brought in during Earth's initial formation.\" For the study, which was published Friday in the journal Science , researchers examined volcanic rocks from Baffin Island off the Canadian coast and Icelandic lava. They noted that the rocks were from ancient sources beneath Earth's surface and have remained untouched since the planet's formation . Using an advanced instrument called an ion microprobe , scientists took a close look inside the rocks to detect any chemical traces of early water, including its hydrogen composition. Advertisement A microscope image of the Baffin Island rock sample, which showed a mineral olivine (in image B) containing tiny amounts of water sourced from deep beneath Earth's surface. Lydia J. Hallis In addition to finding such traces, they determined that the water's chemical composition had very little of a hydrogen isotope called deuterium, which is sometimes called \"heavy hydrogen.\" Deuterium can be linked to different planetary bodies in space, but the amount found in the water suggests that it was not carried to Earth from elsewhere. \"We have to look at the fingerprints both in space , for all the starting materials, and on Earth,\" Dr. Karen Meech, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii and a co-author of the research, told the Christian Science Monitor. \"[Then], like a detective, compare the two to see what the best sources are.\" Advertisement The researchers concluded that water molecules must have been a part of the dust surrounding the sun in our solar system that accumulated to help form our planet -- and around 20 percent of the water studied may have existed when Earth was formed, Nature magazine reported. \"If Earth formed with its water from the very beginning ... there is no reason to assume that the other planets and rocky bodies in our solar system, and possibly in other solar systems, didn't form in the same way,\" Hallis said. \"If this is the case, we would expect that these rocky bodies would also be water rich,\" she said. \"Thus our research indicates that finding 'blue planets' around other stars may be more likely than we previously thought.\" Advertisement The researchers hope their findings may be used to help astronomers find and better understand these other planets in the universe that may be watery. \"What I think is neat about the story of the origin of Earth\u2019s water is if it required some sort of special architecture within our solar system, some special arrangement of all the planetesimals, or migration of the planets to get water to Earth,\" Meech told Discovery News. If so, that has \"huge implications for the thousands of extrasolar planets that have been discovered,\" she said. \"Maybe just being at the right distance from your star is not good enough to get the ingredients for life, namely water.\" Advertisement Previously: Earth's Water May Even Be Older Than The Sun Itself Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

'Lost' GoPro Records Stunning Grand Canyon Footage From Edge Of Space The camera reached an altitude of nearly 100,000 feet. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Sep 15, 2015, 04:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A GoPro camera lost after being launched in a weather balloon two years ago has been recovered, and it has some incredible footage of the Grand Canyon as seen from the edge of space. Bryan Chan and four of his friends, all students at Stanford University, sent the camera and a phone up in a balloon from Tuba City, Arizona, in 2013 . Advertisement During the 90-minute flight, the balloon soared to a height of nearly 100,000 feet -- into the stratosphere -- before it burst: The ballon was gathering data for a dissertation on Fluid Lensing by Ved Chirayath, but the incredible footage was almost lost forever. Although the group had been using an app to track its GPS location, the phone lost the signal. Advertisement \"The problem was that the coverage map we were relying on (looking at you, AT&T) was not accurate, so the phone never got signal as it came back to Earth, and we never heard from it ,\" Chan wrote on reddit. The phone landed some 50 miles away, roughly in the area they expected. Yet without the GPS signal, they were unable to find it. \"TWO YEARS LATER, in a twist of ironic fate, a woman who works at AT&T was on a hike one day and spotted our phone in the barren desert,\" Chan wrote. \"She brings it to an AT&T store, and they identify my friend's SIM card. We got the footage and data a few weeks later!\" Advertisement Check it out in the clip above, which also shows the elaborate planning and preparations that went into the project. If you're planning a similar stunt, be sure to go through proper channels. Chan wrote: (I)t could be potentially dangerous for pilots and other aircraft. We registered with the FAA and let them know our desired time, location of launch, and the balloon's predicted trajectory ahead of time. They responded back with a location and time window in which we could launch our balloon.

By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 13, 2022, 05:35 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Arthur's Stone, Dorstone, Herefordshire, 1992. Arthur's Stone is the remains of a prehistoric burial chamber. English Heritage/Heritage Images via Getty Images An ancient tomb in the United Kingdom that\u2019s older than the Great Pyramids is being excavated for the first time. \u201cArthur\u2019s Stone is one of this country\u2019s outstanding prehistoric monuments, set in a breathtaking location \u2015 yet it remains poorly understood,\u201d Prof. Julian Thomas of Manchester University said in a news release . \u201cOur work seeks to restore it to its rightful place in the story of Neolithic Britain.\u201d Advertisement The tomb \u2015 located in Herefordshire, England \u2015 gets its name from supposed ties to the mythical ruler. \u201cLike many prehistoric monuments in western England and Wales, this tomb has been linked to King Arthur since before the 13th century,\u201d English Heritage said on its website . \u201cAccording to legend, it was here that Arthur slew a giant who left the impression of his elbows on one of the stones as he fell.\u201d The tomb is at least 3,500 years older than the legend of King Arthur, whose stories took place in the 5th and 6th centuries and were first mentioned centuries later. In more modern times, it was believed that the site served as the inspiration for the Stone Table in the C.S. Lewis book, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Advertisement The site is a Neolithic burial chamber, that from the outside appears as a set of stones with a large slab atop: Arthur's Stone was a prehistoric burial chamber formed of huge blocks of stone. The earth mound which once covered it has been worn away. English Heritage/Heritage Images via Getty Images But many centuries ago, it was likely an inner chamber that was covered by an earthen mound. Artwork from English Heritage tried to capture what the site may have looked like centuries ago. A cutaway shows what it may have looked like inside the mound: Advertisement Artwork from English Heritage tried to capture what the site may have looked like centuries ago. English Heritage/Heritage Images via Getty Images \u201cThe tomb has never been excavated, but similar examples in this region have been found to contain incomplete skeletal remains of several people, together with flint flakes, arrowheads and pottery,\u201d English Heritage said on its website. Another artwork depicts a burial at the site: Artist rendering of a burial at the Arthur's Stone. English Heritage/Heritage Images via Getty Images Advertisement Archaeologists believe Arthur\u2019s Stone was also a place where rituals for ancestors may have taken place. Last year, excavations nearby challenged conventional wisdom about the site. It had been believed that the tomb had a right-angle passage within a wedge-shaped stone cairn. Instead, archaeologists discovered that Arthur\u2019s Stone had long ago extended into what is now a nearby field, per Manchester University. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Rare Sighting Of White Whale Inspires Confusion, Awe In Australia It was as \"white as snow.\" By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Aug 11, 2015, 08:43 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Whale watchers in waters north of the Gold Coast Seaway in Queensland, Australia, received a spectacular surprise Monday morning when they spotted a large, white humpback whale emerging from the blue waters. \"He was just traveling along as cool as a cucumber , white as snow,\" one witness told 7 News Queensland. Experts trying to determine whether this beautiful white whale spotted off Queensland is @Migaloo1 #7News #Migaloo https://t.co/7H4c4MUyom \u2014 7 News Queensland (@7NewsQueensland) August 10, 2015 Advertisement Experts disagree on whether the fair-skinned cetacean was the famed Migaloo -- an all-white humpback whale that was first spotted in 1991 and, thanks to multiple sightings , has gained a fan base in Australia and on Twitter . Oskar Peterson, founder of the White Whale Research Centre , told the Australian Associated Press that the whale was too small and white to be Migaloo . Instead, Peterson thinks the whale is Migaloo Junior, a younger white humpback whale that was first seen swimming around the Great Barrier Reef in 2011. (Despite its name, Junior is not proved to be related to Migaloo.) Advertisement Trevor Long, director of marine sciences for Australia's Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation , agrees. \"Although it has a very similar dorsal fin, it's a very clean whale and the last time we saw Migaloo there was some yellowing of his skin,\" Long told the Golden Coast Bulletin. The white whale spotted Monday also appeared to be 8 or 9 years old, he added, whereas Migaloo is estimated to be about 27 years old . Wally Franklin, an academic at Southern Cross University who saw Migaloo in 1992, believes the whale is, in fact, the more senior white whale because of distinct knobs along his backbone , according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Advertisement Smithsonian.com reports that there are only four known white humpback whales : Migaloo, Migaloo Junior, Willow and Bahloo (the latter two have distinct black markings ). But no matter which white whale this was, we think Captain Ahab would be happy. We saw a completely white humpback whale this morning just off the Gold Coast seaway. But it's not Migaloo! pic.twitter.com/f7k9MagTVZ \u2014 SeaWorldWhaleWatch (@SwWhaleWatch) August 10, 2015 Advertisement Beautiful pics of Migaloo Junior frolicking in waters off the #GoldCoast .

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 19, 2022, 05:45 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING BOOTHBAY HARBOR, Maine \u2014 Winter is typically a sleepy time for this small seaside town nestled on a peninsula about an hour northeast of Portland. With no tourists, many businesses shut down entirely for the season. But visitors have flocked here in recent weeks, braving frigid temperatures for a chance to glimpse Boothbay\u2019s newest resident: a rare bird of prey that has no earthly business in this part of the world. Advertisement The Steller\u2019s sea eagle, a giant raptor native to parts of Asia and Siberia, has been bouncing around Maine\u2019s midcoast since Dec. 30 \u2014 its latest stop on an epic journey across North America. While the species occasionally turns up in western Alaska, this is the first time one has been documented in the Lower 48. \u201cI would say that this is the most exciting rare bird that\u2019s ever been in the United States,\u201d Nick Lund, the advocacy and outreach coordinator for Maine Audubon, told HuffPost. Several factors brought Lund to that conclusion. \u201cIts rarity \u2014 there are only 4,000 of them in the entire world,\u201d he said. \u201cIts physical impressiveness. It\u2019s the largest eagle in the world, it\u2019s huge, it\u2019s identifiable. And the fact that it is so far from its home.\u201d Advertisement The stunning bird, which author Thomas Hynes aptly described as a \u201c muppet ,\u201d has a large, cartoonish yellow-orange beak and distinctive white plumage along its upper wings that resembles a splattered snowball. Steller\u2019s sea eagles are significantly larger than bald eagles, with a 6- to 8-foot wingspan, and weigh up to 20 pounds. For whatever reason, the bird seems to have taken a liking to Boothbay, frequenting a number of sites along the water. It is unclear whether it is a male or female. This Steller's sea eagle, pictured here in Boothbay Harbor, Maine, has been slowly making its way across North America since appearing in southeastern Alaska in August 2020. John Putrillo/Man by the Sea Advertisement The scene on Sunday felt like a sporting event. That morning, the bird had been spotted near a seasonal inn at Spruce Point, south of town. The sighting was reported on a 1,700-member GroupMe account created to track and discuss the wayward bird. The news traveled fast. By the time HuffPost made it to Spruce Point at 11:30 a.m., the parking lot and road were lined with cars from Maine, Connecticut and New York. But the bird, perhaps startled by the growing crowd, had been flushed from its perch and headed west, toward Mouse Island. Dozens of bird enthusiasts gathered in small groups along the two-lane road, binoculars and spotting scopes aimed across the harbor. Someone thought they\u2019d found it but was disappointed when it was merely a mundane bald eagle. Then one woman, who\u2019d been viewing the bird from a different vantage point, described its location for other anxious birders. Advertisement \u201cOh, my God!\u201d another woman shouted after catching a glimpse. \u201cI want to give you a big hug,\u201d she told the woman who\u2019d helped point it out. There, on the north end of the island, the eagle\u2019s white wing bars popped against a backdrop of evergreen branches. Every once in a while, it flashed its brightly colored beak. Louis DeMarco, of Brooklyn, New York, was dropping off a kayak for repair in the town of Bath when a friend and fellow birder told him he wasn\u2019t far from the famous bird. Instead of heading home to New York, DeMarco detoured 45 minutes to Boothbay. The decision didn\u2019t disappoint. Advertisement \u201cHoly moly! HOLY MOLY!\u201d DeMarco said repeatedly after someone let him use this scope to view the eagle from across the harbor. \u201cThese are distant views. I think what they usually say is, \u2018Better view desired,\u2019\u201d he said, referencing a saying among birders for when you see a bird but wish you\u2019d been closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had any chance of it, so I\u2019ll take a \u2018better view desired.\u2019\u201d pic.twitter.com/Yu4GNI1avf \u2014 Andy McGann (@AndrewMcGann) January 16, 2022 Advertisement This Steller\u2019s sea eagle first surprised the birding world when it turned up along the Denali highway in southeastern Alaska in August 2020. Since then it has continued a slow journey east , popping up in Texas, eastern Canada and now New England. Before arriving in Maine late last month, it spent a week or so mingling with bald eagles along the Taunton River in southeastern Massachusetts. Many have understandably taken to describing the animal as \u201clost,\u201d but experts say all indications are that it is healthy and content in its travels. \u201cThis eagle is right at home,\u201d Lund said. \u201cIt\u2019s on a different continent, but it is in a place that is very much like its native range. I choose to sort of celebrate it as an explorer, as someone living its best life and going out on its own and making its way in the world.\u201d Advertisement The Steller's sea eagle is pictured Jan. 7 during a snowstorm near Boothbay Harbor, Maine. John Putrillo/Man by the Sea Birds turning up outside their normal range, known as avian vagrancy, is not uncommon. Some do get lost or are blown off course in inclement weather, typically during migration. And raptors, particularly younger ones, have been known to venture out in search of new territory. Lund noted that sightings of rare and vagrant birds tend to spark everything from joy and excitement to concern. Advertisement Laurie Ireland, a lifelong birder and resident of Belfast, Maine, said she found herself in tears thinking about how the eagle might not survive or make it back home. Of all the birds Ireland has observed over the years, the Steller\u2019s ranks high on her list. \u201cI would never get to Russia,\u201d she said. \u201cNever.\u201d A few years ago, a great black hawk, a tropical species native to Central and South America, turned up in Maine and later had to be euthanized after suffering frostbite on its legs. The birding community mourned the loss. Unlike the black hawk, which wasn\u2019t built to survive Maine winters, the Steller\u2019s sea eagle appears to be thriving here, Lund said. Advertisement As for how long it will stick around Boothbay, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cGetting into the spring will be very interesting, because that\u2019s when these birds look for mates and territories,\u201d Lund said. He noted it could possibly settle down and even breed with a bald eagle. (An apparent hybrid of the two eagle species was seen on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, in 2004.) \u201cEveryone\u2019s sort of waiting to see what might happen,\u201d Lund said.

The telescope is designed to peer back so far that scientists can get a glimpse of the dawn of the universe and zoom in on closer cosmic objects with sharper focus. NASA/European Space Agency/Canadian Space Agency/STScI via Associated Press Cosmologists and astronomers reacted with awe Monday after NASA released the first full-color image from the James Webb Space Telescope , heralding the project as a new frontier in space exploration that will allow humanity to view the earliest days of the universe . President Joe Biden unveiled the infrared image during a brief event at the White House. Scientists hope the revolutionary telescope \u2014 a $10 billion collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency \u2014 will document the first stars and galaxies that appeared after the Big Bang, about 14 billion years ago.

Marcia Dunn Jan 13, 2022, 03:19 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A 4 billion-year-old meteorite from Mars that caused a splash here on Earth decades ago contains no evidence of ancient, primitive Martian life after all, scientists reported Thursday. In 1996, a NASA-led team announced that organic compounds in the rock appeared to have been left by living creatures. Other scientists were skeptical and researchers chipped away at that premise over the decades, most recently by a team led by the Carnegie Institution for Science\u2019s Andrew Steele. Advertisement Tiny samples from the meteorite show the carbon-rich compounds are actually the result of water \u2014 most likely salty, or briny, water \u2014 flowing over the rock for a prolonged period, Steele said. The findings appear in the journal Science. During Mars\u2019 wet and early past, at least two impacts occurred near the rock, heating the planet\u2019s surrounding surface, before a third impact bounced it off the red planet and into space millions of years ago. The 4-pound (2-kilogram) rock was found in Antarctica in 1984. Groundwater moving through the cracks in the rock, while it was still on Mars, formed the tiny globs of carbon that are present, according to the researchers. The same thing can happen on Earth and could help explain the presence of methane in Mars\u2019 atmosphere, they said. Advertisement But two scientists who took part in the original study took issue with these latest findings, calling them \u201cdisappointing.\u201d In a shared email, they said they stand by their 1996 observations. \u201cWhile the data presented incrementally adds to our knowledge of (the meteorite), the interpretation is hardly novel, nor is it supported by the research,\u201d wrote Kathie Thomas-Keprta and Simon Clemett, astromaterial researchers at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston. \u201cUnsupported speculation does nothing to resolve the conundrum surrounding the origin of organic matter\u201d in the meteorite, they added. Advertisement According to Steele, advances in technology made his team\u2019s new findings possible. He commended the measurements by the original researchers and noted that their life-claiming hypothesis \u201cwas a reasonable interpretation\u201d at the time. He said he and his team \u2014 which includes NASA, German and British scientists \u2014 took care to present their results \u201cfor what they are, which is a very exciting discovery about Mars and not a study to disprove\u201d the original premise. This finding \u201cis huge for our understanding of how life started on this planet and helps refine the techniques we need to find life elsewhere on Mars, or Enceladus and Europa,\u201d Steele said in an email, referring to Saturn and Jupiter\u2019s moons with subsurface oceans. The only way to prove whether Mars ever had or still has microbial life, according to Steele, is to bring samples to Earth for analysis. NASA\u2019s Perseverance Mars rover already has collected six samples for return to Earth in a decade or so; three dozen samples are desired. Advertisement Millions of years after drifting through space, the meteorite landed on an icefield in Antarctica thousands of years ago. The small gray-green fragment got its name \u2014 Allan Hills 84001 \u2014 from the hills where it was found. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 21, 2021, 02:34 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A Steller\u2019s sea eagle, a rare raptor native to parts of Asia and eastern Russia, has been spotted mingling with bald eagles along a river in southeastern Massachusetts. The stunning eagle first turned up last week along the Taunton River, east of Providence, Rhode Island, and is believed to be the same bird that was previously observed in Alaska and Canada, according to a Facebook post from the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife . Advertisement Steller\u2019s sea eagles can weigh up to 20 pounds and have a 6- to 8-foot wingspan. They have large, cartoonish orange beaks and distinctive white plumage along their upper wings that resembles a splattered snowball. News of the sighting sent birders flocking to the area. One of them, Nick Lund, the advocacy and outreach coordinator for Maine Audubon, blogged about the experience on his website, called \u201cThe Birdist.\u201d Lund had been participating in a Christmas bird count in southern Maine when he received a text from a colleague that said \u201cSteller\u2019s was just found.\u201d Advertisement Lund abandoned the organized bird count, hopped in the car with some fellow birders and drove the two hours south. \u201cWe pull up to the tiny, private beach where the bird was last seen to the dreaded \u2018you just missed it!\u2019\u201d Lund wrote on his blog. \u201cA birder\u2019s nightmare. It flew upriver somewhere and no one knows where it is.\u201d With their car nearly out of gas, the group drove off in hopes of catching a glimpse. Eventually, they received word that the bird had been spotted at Dighton Rock State Park. Advertisement \u201cWe go, park haphazardly, and there it is, across the river with a bunch of Bald Eagles. Holy shit. We\u2019re screaming,\u201d Lund wrote. \u201cAn absolute dream to be all of a sudden standing in this random park in southern Massachusetts looking at a wild, rare Russian monster.\u201d On their way home, the group stopped to purchase a bottle of Russian vodka to \u201c honor our visiting Russian comrade. \u201d HOOOOOLLLYYY SHIIIITTTTTTT pic.twitter.com/8zBHRNRL83 \u2014 The Birdist (@TheBirdist) December 20, 2021 Advertisement This bird of prey\u2019s odyssey thousands of miles from home has captivated scientists and enthusiasts. As The New York Times reported in November, the lost eagle has been slowly makings its way east across North America. It was first spotted along the Denali highway in southeastern Alaska in August 2020, and more recently in eastern Canada. It is even believed to have been sighted in Texas in the spring. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had one here in this area of the world: the Northeast coast of North America or Massachusetts,\u201d Andrew Vitz, a state ornithologist, told The Boston Globe. \u201cThis is like the bird of the decade for people around here.\u201d Birds turning up outside their normal range, known as avian vagrancy, is relatively common, often the result of an animal getting lost or blown off course in a storm. Advertisement Vitz told the Globe that the eagle appears to be in good health and there is no plan to tag or capture it. \u201cIt\u2019s probably trying to find some familiar faces out there \u2014 others of its own species,\u201d he said. The total population of Steller\u2019s sea eagles is estimated at 4,000 to 7,000 individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the bird as \u201cvulnerable.\u201d Related Russia Massachusetts Birds taunton river sea eagle Endangered Right Whale Gives Birth While Entangled In Fishing Gear Florida Planning To Feed Starving Manatees In New Trial Program Inside A Multimillion Dollar Plan To Help Save A Species From Extinction Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Lizard Found Preserved In Amber Is 99-Million-Years-Old, Scientists Say \"It's kind of a missing link.\" Reuters Mar 6, 2016, 09:14 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Various lizard specimens are shown preserved in ancient amber from present-day Myanmar in Southeast Asia. Reuters March 5 (Reuters) - A fossilized lizard found in Southeast Asia preserved in amber dates back some 99 million years, Florida scientists have determined, making it the oldest specimen of its kind and a \"missing link\" for reptile researchers. The lizard is some 75 million years older than the previous record holder, according to researchers at the Florida Museum of Natural History, who announced the finding this week. Advertisement It was found decades ago in a mine along with other ancient, well-preserved reptile fossils, but the U.S. scientists were able to analyze the finds only recently. \"It was incredibly exciting to see these animals for the first time,\" Edward Stanley, a member of the research team, said on Saturday. \"It was exciting and startling, actually, how well they were preserved.\" Scientists believe the chameleon-like creature was an infant when it was trapped in a gush of sticky resin while darting through a tropical forest in what is now Myanmar, in Southeast Asia. Advertisement The creature's entire body, including its eyes and colorful scales, is unusually well-preserved, Stanley said. The other reptiles trapped in the amber, including a gecko and an arctic lizard , were also largely intact. Small reptiles have delicate bodies and typically deteriorate quickly, he said. Being encased in solid amber helped to lock the specimen together. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Stanley and other researchers used high-resolution digital X-ray technology to examine the creatures and estimate the age of the amber without breaking it. Advertisement The discovery will help researchers learn more about the \"lost ecosystem, the lost world\" to which the creatures belonged, Stanley said, and it may help researchers learn more about the creatures' modern relatives. \"It's kind of a missing link,\" Stanley said.

This TV Meteorologist Has Absolutely Had It With The Flat-Earth Movement Keith Carson has a simple challenge for those who think the Earth is flat. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Dec 15, 2017, 05:20 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Count meteorologist Keith Carson among those working in the scientific community who\u2019ve had just about enough of the \u201cflat- Earth \u201d movement. Carson, who works for NBC affiliates WCSH and WLBZ in Maine, spent nearly five minutes flattening the movement\u2019s arguments. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to convince them, he offered a simple challenge: \u201cFind the edge of the Earth, lean backwards and prove to me that gravity is just another big lie.\u201d Advertisement Needless to say, flat-Earthers weren\u2019t thrilled: Some Flat Earthers REALLY didn\u2019t like my segment. pic.twitter.com/R9TrR6zjxW \u2014 Keith Carson (@KeithCarson) December 15, 2017 See his full takedown in the clip above.

Consciousness Works Differently Than You Think, According To This New Theory We might see things before we're actually aware of them. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Apr 16, 2016, 08:08 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A new theory suggests that there are two distinct phases of visual processing. Hemera Technologies via Getty Images We may not be nearly as aware of the world around us as we'd like to think, according to a thought-provoking new theory in cognitive neuroscience. Just like a movie appears continuous even though it's made up of a series of separate images, our brains might use a two-stage model of visual processing to perceive the world in short blips, or \"time slices.\" The brain may then piece the individual frames together into an unbroken image of the world, the new \"time slice theory\" suggests. Advertisement \"We intuitively believe that we are directly aware of things at any moment in time,\" Dr. Frank Scharnowski, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Zurich and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post on Friday. \"This is not the case.\" In a paper published Tuesday in the journal PLoS Biology , an international team of researchers suggests that there's some lag time between when we actually see something and when we become aware of it. Data from previously published psychological and behavioral experiments supports this theory, the researchers determined. The two-stage model they devised suggests that our brains first process visual information from the environment while we're in an unconscious state, and then transfer it to our conscious awareness. Advertisement Here's what the researchers believe happens: First, we rapidly and unconsciously process visual information, which takes only several milliseconds. Then, the features of that visual information are integrated into our conscious awareness in a coherent way, which takes several hundred milliseconds. This would mean that consciousness comes in a series of 400-millisecond \"time slices,\" with gaps of unconsciousness in between. Got that? The researchers' depiction of their \"time slice\" model of visual perception. PLOS One Advertisement \"We do not experience stimuli and objects during their actual presentation, but much later when they are rendered conscious,\" Scharnowski said. \"Such a representation is akin to the answer to the question of how were your holidays: 'We enjoyed the colors of the Tuscan landscape for three days, and then went to Venice for four sunny days at the sea.' The response is a compressed post-hoc description regarding the temporal features of the trip even though the actual event was spread over a long period of time.\" So how much faster is human vision than perception? Much faster. \"We can see the time difference when two bars are presented with a delay of 3 milliseconds,\" Scharnowski said. \"In contrast, conscious perception is much slower and can be delayed for several hundred milliseconds.\" This time lag is a good thing for perception, according to study co-author Dr. Michael Herzog , a professor at the \u00c9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne's Brain Mind Institute in Switzerland. Advertisement \"The brain wants to give you the best, clearest information it can, and this demands a substantial amount of time,\" he said in a statement. \"There is no advantage in making you aware of its unconscious processing, because that would be immensely confusing.\u201d If we don't see the world as a continuous flow and instead process it more like a string of snapshots, human consciousness may not be as coherent as we'd like to think. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Is Obamacare Punishing Hospitals The Wrong Way? A new study finds flaws in Medicare's effort to reduce hospital readmissions. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Sep 15, 2015, 06:36 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The Affordable Care Act seeks to lower hospital readmission rates. Edward McCain via Getty Images An elderly homeless man is admitted to the emergency room complaining of a fever and cough. Doctors take an X-ray and diagnose him with pneumonia. They keep him in the hospital for three days while he takes antibiotics and recovers. Then they discharge him, telling him to continue taking the antibiotics for another week. He takes only half his pills and the disease returns, so he checks back into the hospital. Who's to blame? According to the federal government, the hospital is. Under the Affordable Care Act, hospitals are fined up to 3 percent of their Medicare payments if too many Medicare patients return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. By giving hospitals a financial incentive to reduce readmissions, the idea is to encourage better quality care. Advertisement It's turned out to be a rather large incentive. In 2015, 2,592 hospitals around the country -- more than half of those in operation -- were hit with readmissions penalties, which totaled $420 million . Yet a study published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that many readmissions are unavoidable, especially those involving patients like our hypothetical homeless man with pneumonia. The authors of the paper, who are all affiliated with Harvard Medical School, examined 29 patient characteristics -- including race, education, disability, alcohol intake and prescription drug benefits -- to see whether they had an impact on readmissions. And -- surprise, surprise -- they did. The study found that these 29 factors account for nearly half the difference between the readmissions rates at the best- and the worst-performing hospitals. Advertisement Medicare officials already make some effort to account for the differences in hospitals' patient populations. In computing the expected readmissions rate for any given hospital, they factor in a handful of patient characteristics, including age, sex and conditions being treated. But a number of groups, including the American Hospital Association , have argued that Medicare doesn't sufficiently account for the differences among hospitals. Specifically, they say that the current system penalizes hospitals that admit a larger-than-average share of the poor and especially ill individuals who are the most likely to return to a hospital no matter how effective their care is. The new study supports that idea. Once researchers factored in all the other measures, many of which were associated with socioeconomic status, the readmissions gap between the top and bottom quartiles of hospitals shrunk from 4.4 percentage points to 2.3 percentage points. Advertisement \"By taking account of that disparity between the patient populations between the best- and worst-performing hospitals, we really narrow that range, and so the worst-performing hospitals don't look nearly as bad,\" said the study's lead author, Harvard gerontologist Michael Barnett. \"And maybe the best-performing hospitals don't look as good, because they're taking care of patients that are much less likely to have been readmitted in the first place,\" he added. Prior research has suggested that teaching hospitals, such as those affiliated with Harvard Medical School, are among the institutions hit hardest by readmissions penalties because they tend to serve a disproportionately large share of at-risk patients. Advertisement Medicare's failure to account for hospital differences doesn't only hurt the facilities' bottom line, Barnett said. It could also hurt patients. That's because the incentive program discourages hospitals from admitting patients who are likely to be readmitted. And it takes money away from hospitals that do serve such patients, making them less able to treat future patients effectively. Barnett admitted that it would be difficult for Medicare to take all 29 of the factors his team analyzed into account when assessing penalties. But he noted that the health records that Medicare officials use to compute the penalties already include a number of those factors, and that if the program accounted for just those additional factors, the difference between the best- and worst-performing hospitals would shrink by 25 to 30 percent. Bills before the House and Senate would require that Medicare do so. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

An even better approach, to Barnett's mind, would be to shift the readmission rate calculation toward one focused on improvement. That way, hospitals would be judged by how much they reduced readmissions from year to year -- which is ultimately the point.

Scientists Take Major Step Toward Understanding Schizophrenia A breakthrough discovery sheds light on the genetic basis of the devastating disease. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 28, 2016, 05:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have taken one more step toward understanding the biology of schizophrenia. Images Etc Ltd via Getty Images A landmark new study sheds some light on how certain genes may influence the development of schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric condition that scientists have long struggled to make sense of and to treat. The findings , published Wednesday in the journal Nature, point toward possible causes underlying the psychiatric disorder that affects roughly 3.5 million Americans , or about 1 percent of the general population. Schizophrenia is characterized by symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, cognitive difficulties and abnormal social behavior. Advertisement Psychiatrists know little, however, about its origins and biological underpinnings. \"The fundamental scientific predicament in schizophrenia and in all mental illness is that we haven't known even the most basic things about how these diseases start,\" Dr. Steve McCarroll, a geneticist at Harvard University and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post. \"Any steps toward understanding the root causes of the disease is potentially really helpful.\" For the new study, researchers from across the U.S. collaborated to investigate how genetics influence an individual's chance of developing the disease, isolating one particular gene that seems to drive that risk. They found that people who carry a gene that speeds up or strengthens the normal developmental process of \"synaptic pruning\" in the brain are at a higher risk for developing schizophrenia. Typically, the brain uses this process to shed weak or unneeded neural connections as it matures. This happens primarily during adolescence and young adulthood, and is concentrated in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is associated with high-level thinking, planning and decision-making. Advertisement But in people with schizophrenia, the synaptic pruning process goes into overdrive. This may explain why those individuals have been shown to have fewer neural connections in their prefrontal cortex, and why the disorder almost always shows up during adolescence or young adulthood. \"The great majority of schizophrenia cases present between the ages of 16 and 25, which has always been one of the mysteries of the illness,\" McCarroll said. \"Why would it strike at this particular time in life?\" The researchers found that the gene associated with aggressive tagging of weak neural connections -- meaning that more of these connections are eaten away by proteins than they are in a healthy brain -- also carries the protein C4. The C4 protein tells another protein to attach to synapses, or neural connectors, in the brain. Advertisement \"C4 is essentially placing the Post-it note on synapses that says 'eat me,'\" McCarroll said. \u201cWe think it's incredibly important to understand the biological changes that are taking place during the period of adolescence that establishes human vulnerability to this illness.\"\u201d - Dr. Steve McCarroll, a co-author of the new research While the findings are preliminary, scientists say they represent a step in the right direction. \"This paper gives us a foothold, something we can work on, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been looking for now, for a long, long time,\" Dr. David Goldstein, a professor of genetics at Columbia University who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times . The new findings hopefully will one day pave the way for more effective treatments and screening protocols for the disease, such as a test or drug that could target runaway synaptic pruning. Advertisement \"Drugs today don't treat schizophrenia -- they treat a single symptom of schizophrenia, which is psychosis,\" McCarroll said. \"They don't treat the cognitive decline and the emotional withdrawal that patients endure, because they don't address the root causes. And the reason is that we haven't figured out very basic things about what those root causes are.\" More research needs to be done to confirm the findings, as well as to devise new treatment options. \"We're going to work very hard to try to understand what exactly is changing in the adolescent brain at this particular time of life,\" McCarroll said. \"We think it's incredibly important to understand the biological changes that are taking place during the period of adolescence that establishes human vulnerability to this illness.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Saturn Ring Riddle Finally Solved This is about much more than the planet's rings, too. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 9, 2015, 08:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT In this simulated image of Saturn's rings, color is used to present information about ring particle sizes in different regions. NASA Why do Saturn's rings look like that ? New research from the University of Leicester finally confirms why the planet's iconic rings look the way they do -- and the answer might allow us to make predictions about other planetary rings in the universe. Saturn's rings are made of chunks of ice and rock that range in size from a few inches wide, to 10-feet long. It has long been a mystery as to whether this size distribution occurred for just Saturn's rings , or other planetary rings, such as those surrounding Uranus or Neptune. Advertisement \"Our study revealed that this form of the size distribution is not occasional, but dictated by simple mechanisms of aggregation and fragmentation of particles at their collisions,\" Dr. Nikolai Brilliantov, a math professor at the university and the study's lead investigator, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Furthermore, we proved mathematically that the form of the size distribution is universal, that is, it is not specific for planetary rings of Saturn.\" (Story continues below image.) This is an artist concept of a close-up view of Saturn's ring particles. NASA For the study, the researchers measured how the sizing of the particles follow the so-called math law \"of inverse cubes.\" Advertisement \"That is, the abundance of two meter-size particles is eight times smaller than the abundance of one meter-sized particles, the abundance of three meter-size particles is 27 times smaller and so on,\" Brilliantov said in a written statement. Got that? The pattern ends at about 10 meters in size, which means that particles larger in size are very unlikely to be in Saturn's rings, according to Brilliantov. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Mother And Calf Of Elusive Whale Species Frolic In New Video The whales were only identified as a distinct species in 2003. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Mar 5, 2016, 11:58 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT An Omura's whale mother and calf in a photo from the New England Aquarium. New England Aquarium Elusive whales living near Madagascar swim to and fro in beautiful footage newly released by a biologist with the New England Aquarium. Dr. Salvatore Cerchio, who specializes in marine mammals, traveled to Madagascar more than 10 years ago to study dolphins, according to Fox News . But in 2013, Cerchio and his team discovered a group of Omura\u2019s whales, a species that was previously known only to live in the Indian Ocean near Australia and the western Pacific. Advertisement \u201cOnce we realized they were Omura\u2019s whales, it was mind-boggling because, first of all, no one had studied these animals,\u201d he told Fox. \u201cNo had seen them or documented them in the wild and they were not supposed to be in Madagascar.\" Last year, the biologist released what the New England Aquarium said was the first video of the rare species ever taken in the wild. This week, Cerchio and his team released a new video showing a mother with her calf. Advertisement It's only in 2003 that Omura\u2019s whales were recognized as a distinct species, when Japanese researchers analyzed the DNA of nine whales that had been caught decades earlier. Before that analysis, scientists believed Omura\u2019s whales were a pygmy variety of Bryde\u2019s whales , another species that lives in tropical waters. Omura\u2019s whales are baleen whales -- instead of teeth, they have a stiff, sieve-like filtering system inside their mouths called baleen. Baleen whales open their mouths all the way to take water into their mouths, then push the water out through the baleen, leaving behind small prey like krill for the whales to eat. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Mystery Of Bizarre, Balancing Rocks Just May Be Solved The rocks shed new light on earthquakes and fault lines. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 8, 2015, 08:38 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT In southern California, giant boulders have naturally stacked on top of each other in gravity-defying arrangements. Despite the many earthquakes that shake the nearby San Andreas fault, these rocks haven't yet toppled over. Why? A new, decade-long study suggests that the earthquakes in the region can stop or \"jump\" due to interactions between the San Andreas and nearby San Jacinto fault, allowing for the strong shaking to move around the rocks and not hit them head on, BBC News reported. Advertisement The ways in which these fault lines interact may help seismologists better understand not only big tremors but also how to better prepare for them. \"It was a real scientific puzzle, a real head-scratcher,\" Dr. Lisa Grant Ludwig, professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine , and lead author of the study, said in a written statement. \"How can you have these rocks right next to the San Andreas Fault? It\u2019s an interesting scientific question, but it also has practical implications, because we want our seismic hazard maps to be as good as possible.\" For the study, the researchers analyzed 36 of the rocks, called precariously balanced rocks (or PBRs), located only about four to six miles from the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults. The rocks date back at least 10,000 years and were left balancing on top of each other after meteorological and geological forces washed away the material around them, according to Live Science . Advertisement The researchers compared the fragility of the rocks' positioning with the ground-shaking that magnitude-7.8, magnitude-7.4, and magnitude-7.9 quakes would cause. What did the researchers find? It turns out that the rocks should have fallen over a long time ago since quakes of that magnitude had hit the area before, such as in 1812 and 1857, Science magazine reported. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The researchers concluded that only interaction between the San Jacinto and San Andreas faults could have produced the earthquakes' \"jumping\" to preserve the balanced rocks. Advertisement \"These faults influence each other, and it looks like sometimes they have probably ruptured together in the past,\" Grant Ludwig said in the statement. \"We can\u2019t say so for sure, but that\u2019s what our data point toward, and it\u2019s an important possibility that we should think about in doing our earthquake planning.\" The study was published online in the journal Seismological Research Letters on August 5, 2015.

Scientists Dissolve Everyday Objects In Acid, But One Item Surprisingly Survives Don't try this at home! By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Apr 16, 2016, 06:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT YouTube channel \u201c Chemistry Flicks \u201d has been hard at work dousing everyday objects in acid, all in the name of science. They've coated a host of items -- including fruit, meat, a lab coat, chocolate, and a smartphone -- in chlorosulfonic acid over the past two weeks. All but one of the objects ended up obliterated. And the substance that survived will probably surprise you. Advertisement First up, the channel soaked a banana in the colorless, corrosive liquid: It didn't end well. Then, they used the acid -- which is corrosive to metals and can cause severe burns -- on a sponge: Advertisement The scientists then graduated to larger objects, such as this chicken breast: Curious as to how the acid, which is very toxic if inhaled, would affect their lab coats if they accidentally spilled it, they tried it out: Advertisement Oops! Next, they destroyed an LG Nexus 5 smartphone: But the one substance that didn't appear to be damaged by the acid was.... Yes, chocolate! Some commenters lightheartedly suggested that lab coats should be made out of the sweet treat. \"It would definitely make science more delicious! Probably sticky too,\" one of the team replied on the channel. Advertisement It's unclear exactly where the scientists behind \"Chemistry Flicks\" are located. The Huffington Post has reached out for further information.

Kalevi Kull: Censorship & Royal Society Evo Event Kalevi Kull: Censorship & Royal Society Evo Event By Suzan Mazur, Contributor journalist journalist Jul 3, 2016, 07:22 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Founders of the Copenhagen-Tartu School of Biosemiotics at a Seminar in Estonia: (l-r) KALEVI KULL, Claus Emmeche, Jesper Hoffmeyer, Frederik Stjernfelt Biosemiotics pioneer Kalevi Kull has sent the following letter to me in response to one of the organizers of the upcoming Royal Society public meeting on paradigm shift attempting to censor my coverage of the event. Kalevi Kull plans to attend the November gathering in London. Dear Suzan, Well, I really interpret the letter you refer to in your article [\" Censorpship & Upcoming Royal Society Evo Meeting \"] as evidence that this IS a paradigm shift. Because it focuses not on the biological theory itself, but on social matters in academia. And this is a serious hint. Because if this kind of deep change happens, then very many scientists face a problem of how to survive this change because the new dominant model they would like to accept results in many of their previous writings losing much of their value. Nobody wants to belong to the party of losers. One of the best strategies in such a case is evidently an interpretation of the change as a gradual accumulation of knowledge while their work has always been at the cutting edge. Advertisement [Following is the censorship email Kull refers to above -- it was not written by Denis Noble : \"Could I request that you stop referring to the forthcoming RS-BA meeting (\"New Trends in Evolutionary Biology: Biological, Philosophical and Social Science Perspectives\"), and to the extended evolutionary synthesis, more generally, as in some way advocating a \"paradigm shift\". Such language is both misleading (the vast majority of scientists working towards an extended synthesis do not seek revolutionary change in neo-Darwinism) and counterproductive (such talk undermines calm scientific discussion by creating an unnecessarily emotive and antagonistic atmosphere). I view the Kuhnian model as superseded long ago: the data suggests that sciences rarely if ever change through \"revolutions\". Lakatos' framework of \"research programmes\" offers a more up-to-date, accurate and useful conceptualization of (gradual and progressive) scientific change. The extended evolutionary synthesis is best regarded as an alternative research programme, entirely complementary to orthodox evolutionary biology. Talk of \"paradigm shift\" gives the false impression that the differences amongst evolutionary biologists are far more extreme than they actually are. . . .\"] [Kalevi Kull's correspondence continues:] Is this a radical change in biology what is going on now? The contrast is quite clear, if we look at how evolutionary innovation is described. Either innovation begins from a new mutation, followed by newly behaving phenotype, which is amplified by natural selection (this is what the neo-Darwinian model suggests), or innovation begins from a change of function (with habitat choice, or resource choice, etc.) first stabilised by epigenetic or ecological inheritance and followed by fixation due to mutational noise (which is what the new model states, let us call it the post-Darwinan model). Advertisement That is: either a genetic change first, followed by functional change, or a functional (epigenetic, i.e., non-genetic) change first, followed by genetic changes. The details of this contrast are described, for instance, in my work \" Adaptive Evolution without Natural Selection \" published in the Linnean Society journal. . . but there are many scholars who share this model. That paper provides a row of references. Isn't it a deep contrast, and a possible move from one to another, a radical change of the major model of evolution? However, if indeed one knows all the dramatic history of the theory of evolution. . . Here's a sketch. Estonia has been described as a country with one of the richest political experiences. We also see this in our history of Darwinism. Advertisement In the 19th century, Tartu University was one of the leading German-language universities, and one of the leading critics of Darwin was working at Tartu University -- Karl Ernst von Baer , the founder of developmental biology. Simultaneously, one of the very first courses in the world and best textbooks written about Darwin's-time Darwinism was provided by a professor at the same university, Georg Seidlitz . Around the turn of the century, before WWI, Tartu University was a Russian-language university, and Darwinism was soon popularised as supporting early socialist ideas. Soon after, together with advances in genetics, evolutionary theory was interpreted as a basis for eugenics (also used in this way by national socialists in Germany before WWII). Then Estonia was annexed by Russia, and after the WWII for more than a decade it meant the influence of vulgar Darwinism (also called 'creative Darwinism' at that time), as propagated by Lysenko (yes, he also praised Darwin, he just did not like genetics). Advertisement In the 1970s and 80s, all students in the Soviet Union had to learn how Darwinism goes hand in hand with Marxism, meaning a good connection with the 'synthetic theory of evolution', which was a synonym for neo-Darwinism. . . Simultaneously, a radical non-Darwinism was also developing within certain circles of Soviet biologists, who took it from the theory of Nomogenesis of Lev Berg and his follower Alexander Lyubischev . After the collapse of the Soviet Union, an outgrowth of neo-Darwinism called sociobiology became a dominant view for many, particularly among zoologists. . . If one has read all this and been able to understand why all these scholars had the views they had, it is hardly possible to describe this history as gradual improvement of a model, continuous extension of a synthesis. There have rather been different paradigms existing and developing in parallel. Most of the time just one of them was strongly dominant over the other. And since evolutionary theory has almost always been tied to some ideological battles, its changes were not limited by scientific discoveries. Advertisement Nevertheless, we have good friends and colleagues whose views about evolution we do not share. But should we therefore be less strict in our formulations about our views? No, that would mean giving up our understanding. Good teachers wouldn't do so. Science, deeply speaking, is the mutual help in understanding. We should help each other as friends; nobody is understanding everything. Keeping this in mind, the best way to make our thoughts clear is to use formulations that do not hide meaning. A better understanding is not always an extension of the earlier model, sometimes it is an alternative. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In other words -- summarizing -- claiming that what is going on is just an ongoing extension of Darwinism would be equivalent to saying that Einsteinian physics is just an extended Newtonianism. Why not, one may describe it so. However, the Einsteinian change became a classic example of a paradigm shift, for Kuhn. . . . Advertisement I like very much your writings.

This Ghostly Fish Has Never Been Seen Alive Before. Until Now. \"This is just remarkable.\" By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jul 3, 2016, 09:17 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have uncovered another secret of the deep. A fish that has never been seen alive before has been caught on camera swimming in the depths of the western Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench . The 4-inch-long ghostly looking creature, believed to belong to the Aphyonidae family, was glimpsed exploring a ridge 1.5 miles below the water's surface. Advertisement Okeanos Explorer , a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship, filmed the almost-transparent fish via one of its remotely operated underwater vehicles. Researchers posted the footage to YouTube on Friday. \" This is just remarkable ,\" Dr. Bruce Mundy, fisheries biologist with the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, said in the now viral video. Advertisement \"I am sure that this is an Aphyonid and I am sure that this is the first time a fish of this family has ever been seen alive,\" he added. \"This is really an unusual sighting.\" Mundy said fish belonging to the Aphyonidae family, which are in the same Ophidiiformes order as cusk eels , had previously only been seen dead -- after being brought up to the surface by deep-sea trawlers or dredgers. #Okeanos scientists image ghostly fish that has never been seen alive -- until now: https://t.co/BniyP2Ay2i pic.twitter.com/Wc1hCiFWmR \u2014 NOAA Ocean Explorer (@oceanexplorer) July 1, 2016 Advertisement \" Some of us working with fish have wish lists, you know, a sort of bucket list of what we might want to see,\" Mundy added in the clip. \"And a fish in this family was probably first on those lists for a lot of us.\" The Okeanos Explorer team is surveying the deep-water areas of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands until July 10. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Spore' screenshot By Alex Leith , Michigan State University You look down from the sky, manipulating the world and seeing how it responds to your changes. You are able to alter vegetation and climate while watching their effects on the surrounding organisms. In this way, and many others, digital games provide excellent opportunities for players to learn about complicated subjects, including the concept of evolution through natural selection. Even games designed for fun and not specifically for education can provide rich, concise, dynamic representations of complex science, technology, engineering and math topics. Since I was young, digital games have successfully supplemented the educational process in a range of topics, including math, science and biology. Research shows that if these games are going to actually teach those concepts, they must represent them accurately . Games that include incorrect depictions teach the wrong lessons. Since Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, evolution has been understood as a process based on genetic differences between individual organisms of the same species. There are three key principles: Advertisement Organisms with genetic advantages for their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, while organisms whose genes make their bodies less suited will die more quickly and reproduce less effectively. Because these characteristics are genetic, they are passed on to offspring. Organisms with genes that improve their survival will have more successful offspring, which will in turn pass on their advantages to the next generation. Some colleagues and I looked into how well current games could serve as educational tools, specifically about evolution. We examined how Darwinian evolution was represented in 22 games, which we located either through game databases like GameSpot or IGN , or through Google searches. Most games got evolution at least partly wrong. Only five accurately represented all three key principles of evolution. The five that got it right A screen-capture of a Norn interacting with its environment in 'Creatures 2,' developed by Creatures Labs and published by Mindscape. Wikipedia Advertisement \" Creatures \" provides a rare example of the three principles. In that game, players create cartoon-like creatures called \"norns,\" through a process that allows norns to be altered not just in terms of appearance, but at the genetic level. For the most accurate representation of evolution, the game offers a play mode called \"wolfling run.\" In that mode, players cannot directly affect their norns, but can observe their relative fitness for a particular in-game scenario. The potential variations in both norn creation and the environment they must survive in provide for an astonishing number of evolutionary possibilities. Maxis, best known for creating the \"SimCity\" game series, and its spinoff \"The Sims\" collection, also made a set of games called \"SimEarth\" and \"SimLife.\" Like \"SimCity,\" both give players top-down control of a world. \" SimEarth \" was designed for players to make major changes to the weather, landscape and animals to create an environment. Players were then able to see how the animals would fare in this created environment. \" SimLife \" was more specific: it has players engage with the animals (rather than merely creating them) to learn about the biology surrounding their survival. A screen-capture of 'Who Wants to Live a Million Years,' playable on the Science Channel website. from sciencechannel.com Advertisement We also found two academically oriented games that loosely presented the three mechanics of evolution: \" Selection Game \" and \"Who Wants to Live a Million Years\" (which was later renamed \" Charles Darwin's Game of Survival \"). The two games were designed to be simple tools that could be played quickly in places like museums. Despite the limited mechanics present in such games, they still clearly show each element of the evolution process. Market success doesn't mean accuracy The most commercially popular game we found didn't quite get evolution right. \" Spore \" left out something many other games did, too: Organisms' genetic differences didn't affect their survival rates. Instead, organisms whose genes were unfit for the environment would not necessarily die more often, in keeping with evolutionary principles. Rather, players could intervene and increase an organism's likelihood for success by, say, helping it move more intelligently and strategically, beyond the scope of its genetically predisposed movements. Nevertheless, \"Spore\" does a reasonable job presenting the broader concept of evolution to players, and is the best such game made this century. (\"Creatures,\" \"SimEarth,\" and \"SimLife\" are all from the 1990s.) \"Spore\" is also still available for purchase, so it is the only game readily usable by the average educator or student. Advertisement But other findings were disappointing. Most games inaccurately portrayed evolution, usually in the same way Spore did - allowing player intervention to save organisms that were unfit for survival. For these other games, evolution becomes more akin to mutation during a single organism's life than a process that occurs through generations. In \" E.V.O.: Search for Eden \" and \" L.O.L.: Lack of Love ,\" players earn points they can spend to modify their organisms. In \" Eco ,\" at the end of each level, the player arbitrarily changes an attribute, though not necessarily one that affects an organism's survival prospects. In each of these cases, what the game calls \"evolution\" is actually external genetic manipulation, rather than inheriting particular traits. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These inaccuracies may confuse those unsure of what evolution actually is. If other scientific subjects are similarly poorly depicted in video games, the potential educational benefits of these games could be lost. However, as game designers become more adept at modeling scientific themes, it could herald an educational revolution.

Why It's Impossible To Focus When You Haven't Slept Sleep and attention regulate each other \"like yin and yang.\" By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 25, 2016, 10:05 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A new study finds that sleep and attention balance one another. Thomas Barwick/Getty Images We all know how difficult it is to pay attention at work -- or to get anything done, for that matter -- after a night of bad sleep. It should come as little surprise, then, that sleep and attention are critically linked. Now, a new study from neuroscientists at the Queensland Brain Institute in Australia reveals why the ability to pay attention during the day relies on our capacity to do the opposite at night. Advertisement The researchers explain that sleep and attention are \"like yin and yang\" -- opposing forces that work together to create harmony -- and the two systems may have even co-evolved to regulate each other. \"The yin and yang in Chinese philosophy describe contrary forces that are in fact interdependent and give rise to each other, as with light and dark,\" Leonie Kirszenblat, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Queensland and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post. \"Sleep and attention seem like opposite brain states, but they may actually arise from similar brain mechanisms that relate to ignoring the outside world.\" Sleep and attention may balance each other, because the ability to pay attention depends on getting adequate sleep and the amount of sleep we need seems to be driven by learning and performing tasks that require attention. Advertisement \u201cSleep and attention may be two sides of the same coin.\u201d - Leonie Kirszenblat, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Queensland The researchers analyzed a variety of sleep studies conducted on animals, investigating the function of sleep in different types of species. The data revealed that in animals with simple nervous systems, such as nematodes, sleep is used for development or as a response to environmental stress. It turned out that in animals with complex nervous systems -- including insects, humans and other mammals -- sleep isn't only used for growing or responding to stress. Instead, the data showed that sleep is an everyday activity that's used to support cognitive functions, including selective attention. Advertisement The data also suggested that tasks requiring more attention correlated with an increased need for sleep, and a great intensity of sleep. Sleep and attention tend to be viewed as fundamentally different states, but they seem to involve a common mechanism for suppressing external distractions. \"Sleep and attention may be two sides of the same coin,\" Kirszenblat said. \"Both allow animals to selectively process some information, while ignoring most other sensory stimuli. More broadly, we tend to view sleep and wake as fundamentally different phenomena, but mechanistically they might be quite similar because both involve suppressing the outside world.\" Advertisement Dr. Bruno van Swinderen, a neuroscientist at the university, said in a statement that this is a \"revolutionary\" way of thinking about how the brain works during sleep and waking. The study was published in December in the journal Trends in Neurosciences .

SpaceX Rocket Crashes During Drone Ship Landing -- Again On land: 1 for 1. At sea: 0 for 4. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 4, 2016, 09:32 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT After four delayed attempts, Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. , or SpaceX, launched its Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Friday, successfully deploying a communications satellite into orbit. But, as the company had warned may happen, the attempt to land the 14-story rocket booster on a drone ship at sea ended much as did three previous tries: in flames. Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 5, 2016 Advertisement As with previous missions, SpaceX said landing the rocket was a secondary objective . The primary goal of delivering a commercial communications satellite called SES-9 into orbit for the company SES was a success. Friday's attempt was not without suspense. As the rocket booster came in for an upright landing aboard the floating, football field-sized drone ship, comically named Of Course I Still Love You, the video feed cut out. . @SpaceX almost showed its #Falcon9 rocket landing on a drone ship \u2014 but then the video cut out. Fate is unclear. https://t.co/pDpNI9sveU \u2014 Mashable News (@MashableNews) March 4, 2016 Advertisement The hiccup sent anxious viewers into a frenzy. Hey @SpaceX we\u2019re on pins and needles! \u2014 Verge Science (@VergeScience) March 4, 2016 Criminy, @SpaceX - I NEED TO KNOW! I need a shower. \u2014 Curt Godwin (@Crow_T_Robot) March 5, 2016 Musk later broke the news of the crash -- which the company had warned in advance may happen -- via Twitter. Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks @SES_Satellites for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 5, 2016 SES-9 spacecraft in Geo Transfer Orbit, 40,600 km in altitude.

Scrambling helo to get them to move. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 28, 2016 In December, SpaceX made history when a Falcon 9 landed successfully on land about six miles from where it took off. Musk called it a \" revolutionary \" moment and a \"critical step along the way to being able to establish a city on Mars.\" Landing at sea, however, has proven much more challenging. Last month, a SpaceX landing off the coast of California ended in flames after one of the rocket's landing legs failed to lock in place. Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it to tip over post landing. Root cause may have been ice buildup due to condensation from heavy fog at liftoff.

Climate Change Made Hurricane Harvey Worse, Scientists Say Rain associated with the lethal storm was at least 15 percent stronger, thanks to our warming world. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 13, 2017, 05:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Hurricane Harvey, seen here in a photo taken from the International Space Station, was made worse by climate change, scientists said Wednesday. NASA/Reuters Hurricane Harvey, the historic behemoth that killed dozens and drenched Texas in rain, was made far worse by climate change, scientists said in two separate studies released Wednesday. The research, published in the journals Geophysical Research Letters and Environmental Research Letters and presented at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, found Harvey\u2019s unprecedented rainfall was at least 15 percent heavier due to global warming. The occurrence of such a strong storm was also about three times more likely to happen, the authors concluded. Advertisement Those statistics represent a lower boundary, but in one study, researchers\u2019 best estimate said Harvey\u2019s rainfall was nearly 38 percent worse than a comparable storm from the 1950s. \u201cClimate change made this event more likely and heavier,\u201d Karin van der Wiel, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and a co-author of one of the papers, told The Washington Post. Scientists have long linked climate change to an uptick in damaging natural disasters and said our warming world may soon see bigger and more frequent wildfires, floods and storms. The Post notes some have linked weather events to climate change in the past , including a drought in Texas in 2010 and flooding in Colorado in 2013. Advertisement But only recently, in an effort to counter misinformation, have researchers moved to so quickly link an unprecedented event to climate change, including an effort by a group of scientists known as World Weather Attribution , of which Van der Weil is a part. Harvey was no exception. The storm brought unprecedented rain, up to 50 inches in some places, to the Texas coast in August after landing as a Category 4 hurricane. Over several days, the storm flooded large parts of Houston, displaced tens of thousands and killed more than 80 people . Researchers said they were struck by the intensity of rain after using climate models to compare data from Harvey to conditions that would have created a similar storm a century ago, before greenhouse emissions caused the planet to warm. Advertisement \u201cThe amount of precipitation increase is worse than I expected,\u201d Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an author of the other paper, told The New York Times. Despite the intensity of the weather event, some moved to quickly distance the hurricane from global warming. Among those were President Donald Trump , who said America \u201c had bigger storms \u201d than Harvey or Hurricane Irma in the past when asked about their links to climate change. An even more bizarre claim was made by conservative pundit Ann Coulter, who said she\u2019d blame Houston\u2019s lesbian mayor for Harvey before climate change. Scientists didn\u2019t investigate whether the actual formation of the storm was due to climate change but said the dramatic results of their research confirmed that storms such as Harvey can likely be made worse by human activity. Advertisement Van der Weil said that even if the world is able to limit global warming to the levels established by the landmark Paris climate agreement, the probability of witnessing another storm like Harvey would increase by a factor of three. \u201cIf we miss those targets, the increase in frequency and intensity could be much higher,\u201d she said in a statement.

Four Graphics (And A Book) That Help Explain Climate Change 2015 was the world's warmest year, but these charts tell the long story about the climate. Adam Voiland \u2014 NASA Earth Observatory Jan 26, 2016, 07:34 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Data from 2015, the warmest year ever recorded on Earth. NASA Earth Observatory Though blizzards and cold snaps may have made you forget the news from last week, 2015 was the warmest year in NASA\u2019s global temperature record, which dates back to 1880. During a January 2016 press conference (see the slides here ), Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained that 2015 was 0.87 degrees C (1.57\u00b0F) above the 1951-80 average in the GISS surface temperature analysis (GISTEMP), one of four widely-cited global temperature analyses. The statistical record is notable, but keep in mind that this year is just part of a much longer story about the climate. If you want to learn more about climate science as a whole rather than just the latest headlines, here are a few resources that you may find informative. The list is not comprehensive (and we are open to more suggestions), but it is a useful starting point for understanding climate science. Advertisement Bloomberg Business The plot above comes from an interactive graphic called \u201cWhat\u2019s Really Warming the World?\u201d Put together by Eric Roston and Blacki Migliozzi of Bloomberg News (with assistance from NASA climatologists Gavin Schmidt and Kate Marvel ), the chart does an excellent job of breaking down the various factors (greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar activity, orbital variations, etc.) that affect climate. It parses out visually how much each factor contributes. The bottom line: greenhouse gases are absolutely central to explaining global temperature trends since 1880. The screenshot above hints at what the interactive looks like, but I highly recommend heading over to Bloomberg to see the full graphic. Another invaluable graphic for understanding climate change is the \u201cradiative forcing bar chart\u201d below. (You can read an interesting post by Schmidt that explains how these charts have evolved over the decades). At first glance, the chart from the fifth assessment report by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may seem technical and difficult to understand. It is. But it is well worth looking up the technical terms. Advertisement In short, you are looking at a balance sheet of the major types of emissions that have either a warming or cooling effect on climate. Bars that extend to the left of the 0 signify a cooling effect; bars that extend to the right signify warming. The longer the bar, the more warming or cooling a given type of emissions contributes. What becomes immediately obvious is that carbon dioxide (CO) and methane (CH) have the biggest warming influence by far. The other well-mixed greenhouse gases \u2014 halocarbons, nitrous oxide (N0), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) play a much smaller role. IPCC The situation gets messy when you look at the role that short-lived gases and aerosols play. Some gases like carbon monoxide (CO) and the non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) \u2014 such as benzene, ethanol, formaldehyde \u2014 contribute to warming, but not much. Others like NO actually slightly cool the climate overall if you consider how these gases interact with other substances in the atmosphere. Things get even messier if you look at aerosols. Mineral dust, sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon have a cooling effect. On the other hand, black carbon causes warming. Albedo changes due to land use and changes in solar irradiance are minor in comparison to the other factors. Advertisement That\u2019s a lot of variables, but one reason I like this chart is the error bars and the \u201clevel of confidence\u201d column. The error bars give you a sense of how much uncertainty there is when it comes to the effects of various emissions. Look at the aerosol section, for instance, and you will see that the error bars are quite large and there is still some uncertainty about how aerosols affect clouds. The level of confidence column offers further clues to what scientists understand well and which areas they are less confident about. VH stands for very high confidence; H stands for high confidence; M stands for medium confidence; and L stands for low confidence. What is striking is that even when you account for the error bars, there is little doubt that carbon dioxide and methane are warming the climate. NASA Advertisement A third graphic, produced by NASA but based on data described here , is particularly compelling. Based on atmospheric information preserved in air bubbles in ancient ice cores, the plot offers a view of carbon dioxide levels in Earth\u2019s atmosphere for the past 400,000 years. As this graph makes obvious, it has been a long time since carbon dioxide levels have been anywhere near where they are now. Advertisement For a much more recent view of carbon dioxide levels, the animation above is useful. Produced by NASA\u2019s Scientific Visualization Studio , the video shows a time-series of the distribution and concentration of carbon dioxide in the mid-troposphere, as observed by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the Aqua spacecraft. For comparison, the fluctuations in AIRS data is overlain by a graph of the seasonal variation and interannual increase of carbon dioxide observed at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii. You can clearly see seasonal variations in carbon dioxide levels, but notice also that the mid-tropospheric carbon dioxide shows a steady increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over time. That increase is because of human activity.

Why This Trailblazing Astronaut Never Dreamed Of Going To Space \"I never had doubt that women could do any of this stuff.\" By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Sep 14, 2015, 04:06 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Mae Jemison made history in 1992 when she rocketed into orbit aboard NASA's Space Shuttle Endeavor, becoming the first African-American woman to go into space. And while the physician-turned-astronaut left the space agency the following year, she hasn't abandoned her interest in spaceflight or in science more generally. Jemison, 58, has become an outspoken proponent of diversity in science, technology, engineering and math education, arguing that it's \"bulltwinky\" to suggest that women and minorities aren't good enough to make it in those fields. She doesn't just talk STEM -- she lives it. Jemison is heading up the 100 Year Starship program, which aims to develop the technologies that will enable human interstellar travel. In addition, she's working as a spokesperson for Bayer's Making Science Make Sense initiative , which fosters science literacy among students through hands-on demonstrations and volunteer speakers. And she's helped publicize the results of Bayer's Facts of Science Education survey, which she hopes will help move STEM education forward. Advertisement Jemison recently spoke with The Huffington Post about the origins of her interest in space, the surprising twists and turns of her career and why she'll never fulfill her dream of being a singer. Portrait of Mae Jemison taken at NASA in 1992. Mae Jemison Did you always dream of being an astronaut? I'm going to say no, but not because of the reason you think. I always assumed I'd go into space, but I did not assume I'd have to be a crew member ... When I was growing up, during the Apollo era, I thought that by the time I was old enough to have a job like that, I'd just be a scientist working on Mars. I didn't dream I'd go to space -- I assumed I would, which sounds a little arrogant, especially growing up in the '60s as a young girl, a young African-American, a person of color. Advertisement Why would I just assume? I just thought the universe, the world, was going to figure this out, and that women could do all these things. There was a Russian woman who went up, Valentina Tereshkova, in 1963. I never had doubt that women could do any of this stuff. You seem hesitant to use the word 'dream.' I think it's overused. Dreams have an ethereal quality to them, as though we don't really know we can make them happen. Some things are more concrete than that. I always dreamed I could sing like Shirley Bassey, and that's not happening, I don\u2019t have even the start of a wonderful singing voice. I can sing loud, but Shirley Bassey is wonderful. So I always assumed I had the skill set to do many different things. I think of it as, \"This is what I want to do.\" I am careful about using that word 'dream' because it implies this is something you can\u2019t necessarily make happen. So have big thoughts, have big ambitions. \u201cI didn't dream I'd go to space -- I assumed I would.\u201d Advertisement Growing up, who were your role models? We learn from everybody, whether we call him or her a role model or not, even if that person is not a positive role model. You may learn procrastination from somebody as you\u2019re growing up. The folks who influenced me most in terms of my behavior and things like that were my parents and my schoolteachers. People that I worked with in labs, dance instructors -- oh my God, the work ethic and imagination of dance instructors and social scientists. They were the ones that probably influenced me the most. In terms of space, there were really cool people that went into space, but here's the thing: I would have wanted to go into space if there had never ever been anybody of any kind in space ... I knew who the women and the African-Americans that had been to space were, I knew [NASA astronaut] John Young, and certainly I was very impressed with them. But I would have applied. It didn't matter. Mission specialist N. Jan Davis works with Mae Jemison while in orbit. NASA Advertisement Did anyone discourage you from applying to the space program? I didn't run around telling people, \"I\u2019m going to apply to be an astronaut.\" That's my business. Why would you share what you want to do with every ancillary person that may or may not tell you to do this? I probably got more discouragement when I worked in a Cambodian refugee camp. How did you come to work in Cambodia? In medical school, in the late 1970s, early 1980s, as the Khmer Rouge were being run out of Cambodia by the Vietnamese, there were all these refugees coming into Thailand. My medical school staffed a facility, and one of the deals was that fourth-year medical students could come. So I was in a place where there were refugees coming in, still just off the border with skirmishes going on. My mother was uncomfortable with me going into that environment -- more around that, where you could see an active problem, than the astronaut program. \u201cAs we strive for an extraordinary tomorrow, we create a better world today. As we look at building the capabilities for sustaining human travel outside the solar system we\u2019ll find solutions for some of the most pressing science and technology and cultural problems that we face on Earth today.\u201d Advertisement You left NASA in 1993. How did you feel about that transition? One of the things I think is really important is to have new experiences and talk about new experiences. What I found is, a lot of what I learned about space exploration, I look back on those technologies and I think, \"Wow, they would be really great and helpful for the developing world.\" When I left NASA, I left because I wanted to work on how to use advanced technologies on helping developing countries and sustainable technology design. That\u2019s where my past experiences blend. And it's important to have different disciplines and be wide open to thinking about the world differently. Do you agree with those who say the U.S. has a STEM problem -- that not enough young people are pursuing educations and careers in science, technology, engineering and math? If so, what should be done to remedy the situation? Advertisement As far as the U.S. is concerned, we have a problem with exploiting, developing the full range of talent that we have in this country, and this is particularly true in the science, math and engineering fields. It happens because many of the people in those fields don't recognize the talent of the full range of women and the full range of minorities as important. When I started with the Bayer program 20 years ago, there was less recognition of science and science careers and jobs. Over the years, if you look at the [Facts of Science Education] survey, parents and teachers recognize the importance of it, which is great. People even know the word STEM, and there was a whole phrase coined! People recognize the importance of hands-on education. It's not about just drilling and saying, \"Memorize the periodic table.\" It's the hands-on engagement that makes the difference. What do you think explains the lack of diversity in STEM? Girls do as well as, or better than, boys all the way through high school. That's fact. They go into college wanting to go into STEM fields, but graduate in lower numbers percentage-wise. The survey asked professors about this. A lot of the professors at these research universities say they recognize and consider the women the best-prepared to graduate in a STEM field. Yet they were okay with the women not graduating because they felt that maybe the women couldn't cut it, that they weren't tough enough. It was bulltwinky. Advertisement And we know it's nonsense because at Harvey Mudd College, Maria Klawe, the president, was able to -- in just five years -- triple the number of women graduating in computer sciences. They changed the way the courses were taught, but they didn't make the work any less. They separated the kids who quote-unquote know computer science and try to lord it over folks, but they all had to be in the same place at the end of the year. They brought mentors and images, and guess what? It also helped males. \u201cI don't know if it\u2019s even advice, but it\u2019s a way of living: Just find the humor in stuff.\u201d What advice do you have for STEM teachers? Before I started working with Bayer, I was working on a program -- a camp called The Earth We Share -- and it was for kids ages 12 to 16. That the rough age where it's like, \"What\u2019s the role I'm going to play?\" And people start looking at each other and [saying], \"What am I supposed to act like?\" And you see girls dropping out from wanting to be in science. But you know what? We had more girls applying than boys, and the girls ran the place. I was like, \"Okay, you need to let the guys do some stuff!\" Advertisement I think this is the whole idea of public figures, and maybe it's because I was close enough to them to actually be a role model, they were like, \"Okay, this is Dr. J's camp. I don\u2019t have to let go of my assertiveness.\" It was just amazing. So interesting, because the girls had no compunction about being in charge. That had to do with people\u2019s expectations and attitudes. What\u2019s the best piece of advice you ever received? I have no single piece because each one is episodic. One that's not really great for one situation is perfect for another. But the one that I've always found helpful ... I don't know if it\u2019s even advice, but it\u2019s a way of living: Just find the humor in stuff. Stuff is really funny. You can take yourself so seriously and so dramatically. Go ahead and mope, you got one day to mope, or two days to mope. But then look for the humor in it, it's kind of funny. I'm not talking about loss and death, but some of the things where you're like, \"That was just crazy\" are pretty funny. Today, Mae Jemison works on the 100 Year Starship, along with Bayer's 'Making Science Make Sense' project. Mae Jemison Advertisement What are the goals of the 100 Year Starship program? The idea behind the 100 Year Starship program is this: As we strive for an extraordinary tomorrow, we create a better world today. As we look at building the capabilities for sustaining human travel outside the solar system, we\u2019ll find solutions for some of the most pressing science and technology and cultural problems that we face on Earth today ... The further and further away from the Earth [you] travel, the more self-sufficient you have to be, and the more you have to think about the whole thing differently. When you do that, you bring other perspectives to bear. Our proposal to DARPA [the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] was, \"An inclusive, audacious journey transforms life here on earth and beyond.\" The first word is \"inclusive\" and that comes from the perspective I bring. I know that we need a full range of talent across not only disciplines, but also ethnicity, gender and geography, to really deal with this. 100 Year Starship is about building a global ambition to do bigger things. \u201cThey felt that maybe the women couldn't cut it, that they weren't tough enough. It was bulltwinky.\u201d Advertisement Which of your other projects are you excited about now? The work that I do with Bayer, I think it\u2019s really important about public-private partnerships -- corporations going in not just to sell their product, but also to support the next generation of scientists. I wouldn't be here without my third-grade science teacher or my sixth-grade teacher. They both had the latitude to let me do different things so they could keep me interested. The Thank You campaign Bayer is doing allowed me to thank Mrs. Miller, and she got to come to my launch. She was one of the people that knew I was crazy about space. It helps me as much as it helps them, to express that appreciation. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Billions Of Cicadas Are About To Rise From The Earth, Have Sex And Die Here's what all the buzz is about. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 16, 2016, 01:28 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Hope you like the sound of humming. That is, if you live in the Northeastern United States, anyway. Billions of cicadas are slated to rise up from the ground in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio to mate next month, The Washington Post reports. They have been lying in wait since they began life in 1999. This summer, at age 17, they\u2019ll finally be crawling above ground to make the lives of human beings a living hell, just like any good teens. Advertisement Then, the winged insects will mate and die off in around a month. These \u201c17-year-cicadas\u201d include three different species , according to Discovery News. Other types are on a one-year or 13-year schedule. This year\u2019s cicada crop will emerge as nymphs once nighttime soil temperatures eight-inches below the surface hit 64 degrees for four days in a row, according to The Plain Dealer. The nymphs climb into trees, then shed their exoskeletons to emerge as red-eyed adults, ready to breed. Cicadas eat tree sap and typically don\u2019t damage plants significantly . They also don\u2019t bite or sting. But what some folks dread is the incessant noise. Advertisement Sure, that doesn\u2019t sound so bad, but when hordes of the insects are all buzzing at once, it\u2019s a little weird. \u201cIt feels like an alien spaceship coming in,\u201d Gene Miller, a resident of Arlington, Virginia, told The Washington Post in 2004. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Venus-Like Planet Sheds New Light On Alien Atmospheres \"This planet is going to be a favorite target of astronomers for years to come.\" By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Nov 11, 2015, 01:31 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT GJ 1132b, a newfound rocky exoplanet only 39 light-years away, circles a red dwarf star. Dana Berry A Venus-like alien world may hold clues to how rocky planets with atmospheres like our own have evolved in the universe. Named GJ 1132b, it is only 39 light-years away -- close enough for astronomers to easily conduct further observations. In May, the MEarth-South telescope array at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile discovered the exoplanet -- a planet that orbits a star other than the sun. Now, scientists have determined that the alien world is likely to have an atmosphere, said Dr. David Charbonneau, astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who co-wrote a paper describing the planet. Advertisement \"This is the first terrestrial exoplanet -- meaning a rocky, Earth-sized planet, such as Venus, Mars, Earth -- that is very close and orbits a small star and hence allows us to study its atmosphere,\" Charbonneau told The Huffington Post. The researchers used an apparatus called a spectrograph to measure how much the planet and the star that it orbits, a red dwarf, pull on each other through gravity. This allowed the scientists to determine the mass of GJ 1132b, which is about 60 percent greater than Earth's. They found that the planet is about 16 percent larger than Earth, with a diameter of about 9,200 miles, and that it has an Earth-like gravity. So a person standing on the surface of GJ 1132b would weigh only 20 percent more than they do on our own planet. Advertisement GJ 1132b orbits its star at a distance of 1.4 million miles, which is pretty close. In our own solar system, Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, orbits at a distance of 36 million miles. Because it's so close to its star, GJ 1132b has an estimated surface temperature of around 450 degrees Fahrenheit. That may seem warm, but it's not so hot that the atmosphere would evaporate or escape into space, Charbonneau said. \"However, it is hotter than the Earth, so we think it would have lost its water to space,\" he said. \"This would leave behind an atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.\" Advertisement So far, scientists have only studied exoplanet atmospheres that are mostly composed of hydrogen, similar to Jupiter and Saturn, Charbonneau said. The researchers hope to conduct follow-up observations of GJ 1132b using the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. The nearby world may soon be frequently studied by scientists since it's so close, noted Dr. Zachory Berta-Thompson, an observational astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and lead author of the research. Advertisement \"This planet is going to be a favorite target of astronomers for years to come,\" he said in a statement. The paper describing the planet appeared in the journal Nature on Wednesday.

This Is What Happens When A 'Zombie' Star Eats A Space Rock It's teaching us a lot about the future of our solar system. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 12, 2015, 09:52 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Some 450 light-years away from Earth, a zombie-like white dwarf star is being eerily encircled by the crumbs of an asteroid that it devoured. In a new study, researchers from the University of Warwick in England has modeled an image of the zombie star -- called SDSS J1228+1040 -- that broke up the asteroid after the space rock was dragged into its gravitational pull, creating a Saturn-like ring of dust and gas around the star. Advertisement The researchers hope that better understanding exactly how the white dwarf formed its ring could help scientists model the future of our solar system. After all, J1228+1040 is called a zombie because white dwarf stars are actually the dead remnants of larger stars. When our sun eventually dies, it could end up just like J1228+1040. \"When the Sun eventually runs out of fuel, it will also become a white dwarf,\" Christopher Manser, an astrophysics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Warwick and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"It is currently thought that most of the outer planets, and possibly Mars (and Earth if we are lucky!) will survive this event. By observing systems like SDSSJ1228+1040, we get an idea of what our own solar system will look like billions of years from now.\" For the study, the researchers observed the white dwarf star and the asteroid remains with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile over a 12-year period from 2003 to 2015. These observations allowed the scientists to view the star from various angles and to record details of the light coming from the white dwarf and its surrounding ring. Advertisement The researchers then used a method called Doppler tomography that allowed them to build an image of the zombie star out of data from their observations. The image is the first of its kind to show the structure of the glowing, gaseous remains of J1228+1040's meal. \"To construct the image, we need to see the ring from a wide range of angles, and the rotation is very slow,\" Dr. Boris G\u00e4nsicke, a physics professor at the university and a co-author of the study, told HuffPost. \"We knew for a number of years that something very exciting is happening in the star, but for many years, we did not have enough data to understand the evolution we were seeing.\" This image shows the velocities of the gas in the disc around the white dwarf SDSS J1228+1040. It was mapped out from observations over a 12-year period and by applying a technique called Doppler tomography. University of Warwick/Christopher Manser/ESO Advertisement By measuring the chemical makeup of the ring surrounding the star, the researchers found the debris must have come from a rocky asteroid. \"We used to expect that white dwarfs rest in peace within the stellar graveyard, yet, this particular star awoke, gobbling up an asteroid that ventured too close, making a beautiful decoration around its neck,\" G\u00e4nsicke said. The researchers concluded that the ring was indeed the remnants of an asteroid that had passed too close to the zombie star, which appears to be more than seven times smaller in diameter than Saturn but has more than 2,500 times more mass. Advertisement An artist's impression of the debris disc around the white dwarf star (on left) compared to Saturn and its rings (on right), at the same scale. Mark Garlick (www.markgarlick.com) and University of Warwick/ESO/NASA/Cassini The researchers noticed that there's a huge distance between the star and its rings, so vast in fact that Saturn and its rings could comfortably sit in the gap. The ring also did not appear to change over the 12 years that the researchers have observed it. \"The fact that this disc, in which the material goes around in only a few hours, can also have a stable pattern over a period of 12 years is amazing,\" Manser said. Advertisement G\u00e4nsicke and Manser not only hope to continue observing the debris ring around J1228+1040, but also to model how exactly the asteroid encountered the white dwarf to begin with. The study is slated to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , and has been pre-printed by the European Southern Observatory . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The receptor, a protein called TRPA1, resides in the cellular membrane of our sensory nerve cells. Not only does it detect certain chemical agents outside of our bodies -- from wasabi to tear gas -- but it also gets triggered by pain-inducing signals within our bodies from itches and inflammation. Advertisement \u201cThe pain system is there to warn us when we need to avoid things that can cause injury, but also to enhance protective mechanisms,\u201d Dr. David Julius, professor and chair of the physiology department at the University of California, San Francisco, and senior co-author of the new study, said in a written statement. \u201cOf course, this information may also help guide the design of new analgesic drugs.\u201d (Story continues below.) An animation of the 'wasabi receptor.' The researchers built the new detailed 3D model using an advanced imaging technique known as electron cryo-microscopy , Science magazine reported. Using the model, the researchers discovered a spot in the receptor where wasabi chemical compounds bind, according to a video from UCSF about the research (see above). They noticed that when a receptor encounters such chemical compounds, it activates nerve fibers that then send pain signals to the brain. Ouch! Advertisement There are already a few experimental drugs that target the wasabi receptor to alleviate pain, Smithsonian magazine reported, and the new model allows scientists to see the exact cleft in the protein where those drugs bind -- a discovery which may help guide the development of innovative pain medications. \"A dream of mine is that some of the work we do will translate into medicines people can take for chronic pain ,\" Julius told NPR. \"What the structure does is, it gives pharmaceutical firms sort of a map for either tweaking the drugs that they have... or for developing drugs that might have different properties.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Tour The Dwarf Planet Ceres In This New 3D Video Mystery continues to surround this odd celestial body. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 8, 2015, 09:04 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Get ready to take a tour of dwarf planet Ceres, where mysteries abound -- and get your 3D glasses on if you want the full effect. A new virtual video from NASA (above) features stunning graphics of Ceres while explaining what questions scientists still have about the dwarf's bright silvery spots and strange pyramidal mountain . Advertisement The video's narrator Marc Rayman, director of NASA's Dawn mission, describes the dwarf planet's odd \"spots\" and landscapes. In the video, Rayman says that more data is needed to understand the world's bizarre features. \"We look forward to new, higher-resolution data from the mission's next orbital phase,\" Christopher Russel, Dawn's principal investigator , said in a written statement. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Weather On This Odd Space Object Is Cloudy With A Chance Of Molten Rain The methods used to find this alien world, which has no host star, could help us to better identify life-sustaining objects in the future. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 11, 2015, 10:16 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT An umbrella won't do you much good on this strange Jupiter-like space object. Scientists have determined the weather patterns on PSO J318.5-22 -- a mysterious 20 million-year-old object that does not orbit any star but rather floats freely -- and it turns out that the forecast is pretty extreme. Based on data from the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile, researchers from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland have determined that the orphan world's climate consists of thick clouds of hot dust and droplets of molten iron rain. Their study was published Oct. 30 in The Astrophysical Journal . Advertisement \"These are likely hot silicates and iron droplet clouds,\" Dr. Beth Biller, lead author of the research and a chancellor's fellow at the university's Institute for Astronomy at the School of Physics and Astronomy, told New Scientist . \"This makes Venus look like a nice place.\" PSO J318.5-22, which is similar to a brown dwarf star and sits some 75 light-years from Earth, was discovered in 2013. The weird world is around the same size as Jupiter, but has roughly eight times the mass -- though it's not massive enough to initiate nuclear fusion in its core like a star would, so it glows feebly. To observe the object, the researchers took hundreds of infrared images of PSO J318.55 over time. \"What we did was to observe the object over a period of 5 hours or so in the infrared,\" Biller told The Huffington Post in an email. \"We were able to measure whether the brightness of the object was changing relative to other objects in the field. So as it rotates, different cloud patches (potentially with different temperatures or cloud structures) rotate in and out of our field of view.\" Advertisement The researchers analyzed the different cloud patches, allowing them to determine weather patterns. They noted that this type of analysis would not have been possible had PSO J318.5-22 orbited a mother star, as most planets and similar objects do. The researchers hope to adapt the infrared-imaging technique to study planets that do orbit stars, Biller said. \"Obviously, this is much harder because then you have to overcome the glare of the parent star to even see the planet in the first place,\" she said, \"whereas PSO J318.5-22 is isolated and easy to image.\" Advertisement PSO J318.5-22, as seen in the constellation of Capricornus. WikiMedia/ Panoramic Survey Telescope Scientists still aren't sure why PSO J318.5-22 is isolated and free-floating in space, but according to Biller, there are two theories. PSO J318.5-22 may have formed as a planet around a star and got ejected from that system, or it formed in isolation, condensing out of a star-forming cloud, similar to how brown dwarfs form. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Is The Surreal Way That Whales Sleep When a whale slumbers, half its brain stays awake. By Sarah DiGiulio On Assignment For HuffPost Jul 1, 2016, 11:21 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Toddlers get a lot of credit for being able to fall asleep anywhere. But, whales (and other marine mammals) might have them beat. The humpback whale in this video demonstrates how whales, dolphins and porpoises actually snooze -- suspended completely vertically in the water. The video, filmed off the Turks and Caicos Islands, was published by YouTube user URZALA prod . Advertisement The animal's sleep position may not look as comfortable as going supine on your pillow top queen, but for mammals that live in the water, sleeping up near the surface is about survival. \"They need to be close enough to breathe easily during sleep,\" Paul Manger, a neuroethologist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told The Huffington Post. Whales, dolphins and other mammals that live in the water get the oxygen they need from the air . They \"breathe\" through the blowholes on the tops of their heads. So, the animals need to come to the water's surface both when they are awake and during sleep. Advertisement A humpback whale pops up to the surface. Whales \"breathe\" through the blowholes on the tops of their heads, so they need to be near the water's surface when they sleep. YouTube Observing large groups of whales can be difficult, especially in the wild. But scientists who've observed some species say it's common for them to sleep in a suspended vertical position or a suspended horizontal position. But what really makes whales sleep pros is their ability to sleep with only half their brain at a time. Advertisement \"When whales and dolphins sleep, only half the brain is asleep at any one time with the other half being awake,\" Manger explained. Scientists suspect whales, dolphins and other water-dwelling mammals sleep like this for a lot of reasons , including to monitor breathing, to keep an eye out for potential predators and to conserve body heat and avoid hypothermia (since mammals lose body temperature during sleep). Another view of the sleeping humpback whale. YouTube Advertisement However, in one study, researchers captured footage of whales sleeping in the wild that showed they may sometimes sleep with both sides of their brain. The whales appeared to be totally asleep about 7 percent of the time -- less than two hours a day. \"While there are good ideas about why whales and dolphins sleep the way they do, none of these are, as yet, fully proven,\" Manger said. Still, this video proves whales are pretty zen sleepers. Sarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post\u2019s sleep reporter. You can contact her at sarah.digiulio@ huffingtonpost.com .

Alabama Students Will Finally Be Required To Learn About Climate Change And Evolution \"We still have to teach what the science is.\" By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sep 14, 2015, 05:45 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Science Source/Getty Images Students in Alabama will be required to learn about climate change and evolution for the first time next year, after officials announced an overhaul of the state's science education standards. Until now, teachers in the state weren't required to teach climate change, evolution and other locally controversial topics. Textbooks used in Alabama science classes have for years carried disclaimer stickers stating that evolution is a \"controversial theory,\" not fact. The new course of study, announced on Thursday, doesn't eliminate those warnings, which were originally advocated by Christian conservatives. Advertisement But the updated standards do directly support the teaching of evolution, along with the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and humans are the likely cause. Students will now be required to use scientific evidence to \"support the hypotheses of common ancestry and biological evolution,\" according to the standards, and to analyze humanity's impact on the planet and the resulting climate change. The changes were drafted by a 40-member committee over the course of three years -- including some people with \"very strong religious beliefs,\" Michal Robinson, a science specialist for the state education agency, told The Associated Press. The new curriculum will help improve scientific literacy in the state, where only 21 percent of 10th-graders meet or exceed national science testing standards. Alabama ranked 37th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in average ACT science scores last year. Advertisement The changes were unanimously approved by the Republican-controlled Alabama State Board of Education. This is the first update to the state's science standards since 2005. The standards will officially go into effect during the summer of 2016. But Steve Ricks, director of the Alabama Department of Education's math and science initiative, told The Huffington Post that the state is being \"extremely proactive\" and rolling out the guidelines immediately. The new science will also be accompanied by updated teaching methods that give students a hands-on education extending beyond the textbook. Science classes will soon see a dramatic shift from traditional \"knowledge regurgitation,\" Ricks said, to \"higher-order thinking standards.\" Advertisement \"The new course of study makes a major shift in the way teachers need to teach,\" Ricks said. \"No longer can a teacher take a textbook and have students just read it and answer questions. It'll require [students] to be doing science, investigating, to be actively engaged.\" \"We still have to teach what the science is,\" Robinson told the AP. \"If students want to go into a science field in college or beyond, they have to have a foundation.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Ricks said that while the plans might not roll out perfectly, students will be getting a far better education next year. The state has already launched a program to train teachers in the new material, and he said there's already \"a lot of enthusiasm.\" Advertisement As for those stickers? A committee that will review science texts for compliance with the new standards could consider whether to remove or alter them, officials said. A public hearing is set for Nov. 9 in Montgomery.

LEAVE A COMMENT A visitor wearing a T-Rex costume arrives at the London Comic Con. Peter Nicholls / Reuters By Ed Yong On Wednesday, a team of scientists unveiled a newly discovered dinosaur that had the body and sickle-clawed feet of Velociraptor , the head and snout of a swan, and weird arms that were somewhere between grasping limbs and flattened flippers. This bizarre murder-swan, which the team christened Halszkaraptor , was so odd that when they first saw it, they suspected that it was a fake\u2014a Frankensaur that had been assembled from parts of different dinosaurs. \u201cAll of us thought, when we first saw it: Oh come on no w,\u201d says Philip Currie from the University of Alberta. But after using a particle accelerator to scan the animal, and the rock in which it is still encased, Currie and his colleagues are convinced that it\u2019s the real deal. Advertisement Not everyone is so sure, though. When Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh first saw a picture of Halszkaraptor , his spidey sense also started tingling. Its posture, from the curve of its tail to the way its claws were almost perfectly fanned out, looked strange, as if it was ready for display. Its body looked like that of Velociraptor , but its skull looked like one from a different dinosaur group\u2014the alvarezsaurs . And most worryingly of all, the specimen has a convoluted history. It was poached from Mongolia (as many dinosaurs are), and smuggled into Japan and Britain, before ending up in a private collection in France\u2014a meandering route that offered few reassurances and many chances for tampering. RELATED: Apparently This Is What a Swimming Dinosaur Looks Like \u201cThis new discovery has thrown a lot of us for a loop,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s either really a new dinosaur, which would be awesome, or it\u2019s been tampered with and I really hope that\u2019s not the case. The authors worked really hard to demonstrate that it hasn\u2019t, using the best tools at their disposal. But I wonder if we have the right tools, since the fakes are so sophisticated.\u201d No matter their views on Halszkaraptor , everyone I spoke to agreed that fossil forgery is a surprisingly serious problem. There\u2019s a long history of hoax fossils, like the infamous Piltdown Man \u2014a human skull that was glued to an orangutan\u2019s jaw, and presented as a missing link in human evolution. That was in 1912, but a century on, fake or doctored specimens still abound in fossil shows, private collections, and even in small regional museums. Advertisement These bogus specimens aren\u2019t cries for attention. \u201cIn my experience, I\u2019ve never seen a single specimen that was made by the scientific community to get more publicity,\u201d says Mark Norell , a curator at the American Museum of Natural History. Instead, they\u2019re almost always the work of people trying to earn a buck\u2014often poor farmers in China . RELATED: A 130-Year-Old Fact About Dinosaurs Might Be Wrong There is a lucrative market in fossils, which owes much of its existence to Sue, a beautifully preserved Tyrannosaurus that was unearthed in 1990 and auctioned for $7.6 million. After her sale, \u201ca modern gold rush began, and it has not let up,\u201d wrote Paige Williams in The New Yorker . Fossils became status symbols, attracting wealthy buyers and unscrupulous vendors. An extensive black market arose, connecting fossil-rich sites like China and Mongolia and anyone with money to burn and a penchant for trophies from another age. The fakes are sometimes created from whole cloth\u2014or rather, from whole plaster. These are usually crude and easy to recognize. Currie remembers seeing photos of an alleged Archaeopteryx \u2014a pivotal species which helped to show that birds evolved from other dinosaurs. It was in Beijing, but after Currie flew over, \u201cwithin three seconds of seeing it, I knew it was 100 percent fake,\u201d he says. The weight of it was wrong. The texture of the bone was wrong. No actual paleontologist would be fooled, but Currie found several such fakes in tourist shops, all with expensive price tags. Advertisement In many ways, the market in forged fossils is similar to the one in forged artworks, says Norell, who has a foot in both worlds. When he attends the gargantuan annual fossil show in Tuscon, he takes the same equipment that he uses to examine fine art, like a special ultraviolet light. \u201cI have a carbide needle that I can heat up with a lighter and push onto something,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s real, guys will let you do it. If it has epoxy, they won\u2019t.\u201d RELATED: A Dinosaur-Sized Mystery Some phonies are harder to spot. Currie recalls seeing a Tarbosaurus \u2014a Mongolian relative of Tyrannosaurus\u2014that \u201clooked pretty good and was sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d When his team analyzed it with a medical scanner, they showed that just a single bone in the jaw was real. \u201cIt was convincing enough that we couldn\u2019t be sure how much was real and how much wasn\u2019t.\u201d More often, actual fossils are touched up to make them more dramatic. Another Tarbosaurus , which was famously seized by the American government in 2012 , was mostly real, but its teeth, fingers, and toes had all been reconstructed. Feathered dinosaurs are all the rage, so artisans will sometimes paint the outlines of feathers on their fossils. One dinosaur had a crest added to its skull by fossil-poachers, who wanted to make it look more dramatic and complete; scientists spent so much time removing the extra material that, in a bit of questionable victim-blaming, they named the beast Irritator . And by some estimates , around 80 percent of the marine reptile specimens that are on display in local and regional Chinese museums have been \u201caltered or artificially combined to varying degrees.\u201d Advertisement The vast majority of sham fossils are chimeras\u2014two or more actual specimens that have been glued together to make them seem new. Sometimes, the work is ... not well-researched. Currie once saw a Confuciusornis \u2014a crow-sized Cretaceous bird\u2014that was clearly fake because its foot had been glued directly to its knee, with no shinbone in the middle. It was on display in a Chinese museum. But these pseudosaurs can be far more convincing. In the Gobi desert of Mongolia, dinosaurs are often found in soft sandstone. Fakers have been known to crumble this rock and then re-harden it to glue separate specimens together. \u201cIt can be really hard to tell if that\u2019s fake,\u201d says Brusatte. \u201cIs that original sandstone or sandstone that\u2019s been put back together?\u201d Mostly, these counterfeits have little impact on what we know about dinosaurs. They don\u2019t feature in high-profile papers, and they stay out of the limelight. But there are exceptions. In 1998, the owners of a small Utah museum acquired a specimen from China. The beast was never described in a scientific journal, but that didn\u2019t stop National Geographic from hosting a press conference about it, or featuring it in the magazine as Archaeoraptor\u2014a \u201ctrue missing link in the complex chain that connects dinosaurs to birds.\u201d Advertisement \u201cThe specimen was suspicious right from the beginning,\u201d says Currie, who was one of the scientists called in to examine it. The tail didn\u2019t seem to connect to the body. The feet were exactly symmetrical in a way that real limbs just aren\u2019t, as if one had been made using the other as a template. It turned out that Archaeoraptor was the dinosaur equivalent of a horse costume, with the front and back halves played by different actors. Someone had glued the head and upper body of Yanornis (a primitive bird) to the tail of Microraptor (a four-winged Velociraptor cousin) and the legs and feet of an unidentified animal. Some missing parts had been filled in with a paste that was made from ground-up bone. It looked like bone at first glance because it was , but a medical CT scanner revealed the trickery: The fakes lacked the complex internal structures of real bones. \u201cThe Archaeoraptor fiasco really brought the issue home to dinosaur workers,\u201d says Brusatte. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a big forgery like that in dinosaurs in the last 15 years. But we\u2019re due for something like this to come up again and I just hope that it\u2019s not me who\u2019s fooled by it.\u201d Advertisement He has reason to worry because by his own admission, some of the fakes are \u201creally, really good\u201d\u2014good enough to fool even the trained eye. And the wider problem is that no one really knows which techniques are good enough to distinguish fossils from faux-sils. CT scans helped to pierce the Archaeoraptor illusion, but \u201clooking at a CT scan is oftentimes like looking at a Rorschach test, or at tea leaves,\u201d says Brusatte. \u201cYou can see many things in there.\u201d Would it be good enough to detect sandstone that had been joined together with reconsolidated sandstone? Who knows? That\u2019s why Currie and his colleagues scanned Halszkaraptor using a synchrotron, producing scans that are much higher in resolution. \u201cYou can look at the continuity of the bones and the rocks, and whether there\u2019s any gluing or infilling,\u201d he says. They could even show that the chemical composition of the rock is consistent across the fossil. To fake that, someone would have had to find two specimens from the same site, and join them together using rock that also had the same origins. Currie is highly respected among his peers, and his name gives weight to the claims around Halszkaraptor , even among the skeptics. I asked him how certain he is that the specimen is real, on a scale of 1 to 10. \u201cI\u2019m at least a 9,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou can never say that you are 100 percent sure, because some of these people are really incredible artisans.\u201d Advertisement \u201cYou\u2019re running to catch up with the forgers,\u201d says Brusatte. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the definitive evidence would be either way, or what sort of burden of proof would be enough. The only thing that can prove that it\u2019s genuine is another team finding another skeleton and digging it up themselves. And I hope that happens.\u201d This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com .

Teams Excavating Toilets Flush Out Thousands Of 18th Century Artifacts The remarkable collection spans nearly 300 years of people at the site near Independence Hall. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Jul 2, 2016, 02:51 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT When it comes to excavating toilets, it doesn't get much better than this. Archaeologists found 82,000 artifacts buried inside vaults once used for outhouses in historic Philadelphia. Many date to the American Revolution and include an astounding amount of glassware. ( Scroll down to see nine of the best finds .) Most of the hidden treasures discovered in a dozen brick-lined outhouse vaults called privies were also used as garbage receptacles, archaeologists with the Commonwealth Heritage Group announced in a report that The Huffington Post obtained . Two of the 12 brick-lined privies that were uncovered are seen. These vaults were used as outhouses and garbage receptacles. Commonwealth Heritage Group Advertisement The archaeologists began uncovering the historic pieces in 2014 while working to excavate the land for its current transformation into The Museum of the American Revolution which will open next spring. The site is just two blocks from the Delaware River waterfront and Independence Hall -- where both the U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution were debated and adopted. The majority of the artifacts are said to come from a mid-18th century tavern that was located on Chestnut Street. That recovered collection includes red earthenware made from identifiable local potters. Archaeologists are seen excavating one of the privies uncovered at the site that will be transformed into the Museum of the American Revolution. Commonwealth Heritage Group Advertisement Another particularly impressive piece that the team found and reassembled is an English delftware punch bowl. It's believed to have come from an illegal tavern on Carter's Alley. The piece features a picture of the brigantine ship, Tryphena, which was used to carry the colonists' petition against the Stamp Act from Philadelphia to Liverpool in 1765. Other artifacts the archaeologists found came from largely private households. An assortment of seashells has been linked to a button shop and 750 pieces of printers' type to the city's growing press industry. There was, of course, your typical collection of garbage found. Excavation work is seen underway ahead of the construction of the Museum of the American Revolution. The First Bank is seen on the other side of Third Street. Commonwealth Heritage Group Advertisement Over 1,400 fruit pits, mostly from cherries, were found in one vault, suggesting that someone who lived there was baking -- though no pie dishes were found. In another vault two whole raccoons, 66 birds, fish, and other animal bones, likely from human meals, were found. Another vault, believed to have been used by a household, recovered a curiously large number of alcoholic bottles. The vaults were eventually sealed up beneath several eras of buildings that were built on the site into today. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Oxford Researchers Make Startling Discovery About Ancient St. Nicholas Relic Just don't tell the kids. By Carol Kuruvilla Religion Reporter, HuffPost Dec 11, 2017, 02:35 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A post shared by Dr Georges Kazan (@drgeorgeskazan) on Dec 5, 2017 at 4:56pm PST Researchers at Oxford University have used modern scientific technology to test a religious relic believed to belong to St. Nicholas, the fourth-century Christian bishop whose generosity inspired the legend of Santa Claus. Tom Higham and Georges Kazan, directors of the Oxford Relics Cluster , used radiocarbon dating to investigate a pelvic bone fragment thought to belong to the saint. The tests showed that the bone fragment dates to the fourth century \u2015 the period when some historians believe St. Nicholas died. Advertisement Higham, a professor who works with Kazan and others at Oxford to apply scientific techniques to the study of relics , told HuffPost that it\u2019s rare for relics to date back to the time period matching when a saint is believed to have died. He estimated that only one of every 20 relics he\u2019s encountered stands up to this kind of scientific scrutiny. It\u2019s much more likely for the relics to come from a somewhat later historical period. But this bone fragment appears to have defied the team\u2019s expectations, suggesting a possibility the bones may have belonged to St. Nicholas himself. \u201cWe are always surprised when, despite all of the possible opportunities for material to be lost or replaced by something else, that the age we measure for relics such as these come out to be the same age as historically attested,\u201d Higham told HuffPost in an email. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always happen. In this case the date we measured in the laboratory overlapped perfectly with the age expected for St. Nicholas.\u201d Advertisement A 12th century fresco of St. Nicholas of Myra, located in the Church of Ayios Nikolaos tis Steyis, in the Troodos mountains, Cyprus. DEA / A. DAGLI ORTI via Getty Images Christian religious relics are physical objects that have an association with a saint or with Jesus Christ. They can be fragments of a human body, pieces of something the saint owned \u2015 a shirt or a book \u2015 or something the saint touched. In the Catholic tradition , relics are believed to be vehicles through which God brings healing and works miracles. As a result, relics are often kept in churches and \u201c venerated \u201d by the faithful, who come to touch, kiss, or pray next to these sacred objects. St. Nicholas is believed to have lived in the fourth century in Myra, Asia Minor, an area now part of modern-day Turkey. Legends about the bishop paint him as a generous soul who gave freely to the poor. Advertisement He was buried in Myra, but in 1087, his remains were apparently stolen and transported to Bari, Italy. His relics are still buried in a crypt at the Basilica San Nicola in Bari. After the Protestant Reformation, devotion to the saint remained strong in Holland, where he was known in Dutch as Sinterklaas. His myth was eventually tangled with Nordic folk tales of a magician who punished bad children and rewarded good children with gifts. The legend crossed the Atlantic with Dutch colonists in the 17th century. Sinterklaas was eventually adopted by America\u2019s English speakers as Santa Claus and became known as the jolly, generous fellow who presented children with gifts at Christmastime. Advertisement While most of St. Nicholas\u2019 relics remain in Bari, pieces associated with the saint have dispersed to other regions of the world. Other parts are at the Chiesa di San Nicolo al Lido in Venice, Italy. Many of St. Nicholas' remains are still buried in a crypt at the Basilica San Nicola in Bari. Bildagentur-online via Getty Images The bone that the Oxford researchers analyzed came from Lyon in France, and is now owned by the Rev. Dennis O\u2019Neill, a Catholic priest in the Chicago area who collects Christian relics. Advertisement The Oxford researchers\u2019 interest in O\u2019Neill\u2019s collection was piqued when they heard that the pelvic bone fragment owned by the Chicago priest is from the left pubis (the lower part of the bone), while the remains in Bari only have the left ilium (from the upper part of the bone). This suggested both fragments could potentially belong to the same person. Higham said his team is now seeking to study the relics held in Bari, to see if the Chicago bone can be linked to that skeletal material and DNA. In the future, they\u2019re hoping to use palaeogenomics and stable isotope analysis to figure out the deceased\u2019s gender, age at time of death, and the geographic area in which the person lived. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Adorable, 'Ghostlike' Octopus May Be A New Species The 8-legged creature has been nicknamed \"Casper the Friendly Ghost.\" Frank McGurty Mar 5, 2016, 02:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - An underwater research craft has spotted a \"ghostlike\" octopus that appears to belong to a previously unknown species at a depth of more than two miles (3 km) on the floor of the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii, U.S. scientists say. The milky white creature, nicknamed \"Casper the Friendly Ghost\" by Twitter users, was caught on cameras mounted on the craft at a depth of 4,290 meters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. Describing the animal as an incirrate octopod, one of two main groupings of octopods, NOAA said it was the first time an incirrate was spotted so deep in the ocean.

Cephalopods belong to a biological class that includes octopuses, squid and cuttlefish. The octopod \"almost certainly\" was one of a species never previously described by scientists, and it may well belong to a genus that has yet to be identified, Vecchione wrote on the NOAA's website. He could not be reached immediately for further comment. Advertisement NOAA has posted a video on the website showing a pale, rounded form with expressionless eyes and languid tentacles resting on the ocean floor. Its appearance led some Twitter users to say it resembled the cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost. Last week's discovery came during the first dive of the 2016 season from the Okeanos Explorer, a ship operated by NOAA that explores little-known parts of the oceans. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
