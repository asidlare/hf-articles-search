Astronomers Spy Two Massive Stars 'Smooching' Each Other To Death The newly discovered stars could either merge together or die in supernova explosions, leaving behind black holes. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Oct 22, 2015, 10:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This animated artist\u2019s impression shows VFTS 352, the hottest and most massive double star system to date where the two components are in contact and sharing material. The two stars in this extreme system lie about 160,000 light-years from Earth. (Credit: ESO/L. Calcada) K-I-S-S-I-N-G. That's what two massive stars are doing about 160,000 light-years from Earth in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy , an international team of astronomers has discovered. But it turns out that the stars' smooch isn't a romantic one. They're giving each other the kiss of death. The stars make up the system VFTS 352, and the gravity coming from the stars has pulled them into each other, causing their surfaces to connect. Astronomers predict that the newly discovered stars eventually may either merge together to form a rapidly rotating monster star, or they may die in supernova explosions and form binary black holes. Advertisement \"We were very excited to find this system,\" Selma de Mink, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam and a co-author of a paper describing the stars, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"We have found stars that touch before, but they are usually low mass. This is the hottest and most massive one where the stars touch so 'intimately.'\" The astronomers found the peculiar stars using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope , and they noticed that the stars' surfaces are overlapping. \"They even share 30 percent of their material,\" said Hugues Sana, an astronomer at the University of Leuven in Belgium who is a co-author of the paper. \"Such type of binaries where the components' surfaces touch one another are called 'overcontact binaries.' VFTS 352 is the hottest and most massive overcontact binary known to date.\" Advertisement This overcontact binary is so hot, in fact, that the stars' surface temperatures exceed 72,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Since the stars appear to be nearly identical in size, one may not overpower the other once they reach their demise, the astronomers said. But whether the two stars eventually merge or remain compact , the astronomers hope that their discovery will provide new insight about the complex physics that takes place when the components of a binary system interact with one another. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Almeida, an astronomer at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil and lead author of the paper. \"T hese systems are very rare, and only a handful of them are known ...

Drought Costs Californians An Extra $2 Billion In Electricity Expenses Drought Costs Californians An Extra $2 Billion In Electricity Expenses Tara Lohan \u2014 Water Deeply Feb 19, 2016, 07:07 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A new report has revealed that California's drought is costing ratepayers an additional $2 billion in electricity costs. Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press A new report from the Pacific Institute has tallied how four years of drought has impacted electricity prices and pollution from the electricity sector. Reduced flows of surface water has meant less hydropower and more natural gas, which is not good for the wallet or the environment. Water and energy are interconnected and California\u2019s drought is providing another reminder of that fact. Last week the Pacific Institute released a report that calculated the impact of four years of drought on hydropower in California. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t get surface water, we don\u2019t get hydropower,\u201d said Peter Gleick , author of the report and president of the Pacific Institute. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t get hydropower we have to burn more natural gas, when we burn more natural gas it costs more money and there are more pollutants emitted.\u201d The report found that California ratepayers had to cough up an additional $2 billion in electricity costs over the last four years of drought to pay for more expensive natural gas that had to be stepped up to fill in for decreased hydropower. Due to decreased surface water flows from limited rain and snowpack, hydropower declined during the drought and most substantially in 2015. In a normal hydrologic year, says Gleick, California gets about 18 percent of its electricity from hydropower, second only to natural gas. By 2015 that number had fallen as low at 7 percent. And Californians paid the price for it. \u201cThe way it appears is that it\u2019s an incremental cost on all our electric bills, we paid more for electricity than we would otherwise because those costs are passed on directly to ratepayers over time,\u201d said Gleick. There is also an environmental price. Hydroelectricity is one of the cleanest sources of energy and adding more natural gas means greater emissions of pollutants, including nitrous oxides, volatile organic compounds, sulfur oxides, particulates, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, the report found. The drought has also caused power plants to produce an additional 23 million tons of carbon dioxide in the last four years as a result of decreased hydropower. Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press An additional 23 million tons of carbon dioxide came from California power plants in the last four years as a result of decreased hydropower \u2013 a 10 percent increase in CO2 emissions from the electricity-generating sector. \u201cOne of the complications is that the drought has made it harder to meet the greenhouse gas targets that the governor has set,\u201d said Gleick. There are other reasons to be concerned, as well. \u201cA linear trend fitted to the data shows that hydroelectricity generation has been declining over the past 15 years, largely due to drought conditions,\u201d the report states. \u201cIf you look at the last 15 years the trend is definitely down,\u201d says Gleick. \u201cI think an unresolved question is whether this is a long-term trend that is going to continue.\u201d Is drought the \u201cnew normal\u201d for California, as many have suggested? A report published February 4 in Geophysical Research Letters found that droughts in the Southwest are likely to become more common as bigger storms have been occurring less frequently. There are also other impacts that drought may have on energy. One of the consequences of the drought has been a massive increase in groundwater pumping to make up for a lack of surface water. Nowhere has this been more acutely felt than in the San Joaquin Valley, where overdrafting of aquifers has caused concern about falling groundwater levels, subsidence and consequences for farmers. But, Gleick says, there is one major area that no one has studied yet and that\u2019s how much energy is being used to pump that groundwater, which is increasingly being pumped from deeper depths. \u201cIt is potentially very significant,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have data on the volume of groundwater that\u2019s actually been pumped or the depth from which it has been pumped and we\u2019d need both of those to calculate the true energy cost of this additional energy cost.\u201d There are of course no easy fixes for increasing hydropower since any spot where you could put a hydroelectric dam already has one. But Gleick says there is still a lot we can do with water conservation and efficiency, wastewater treatment and reuse and stormwater capture. \u201cMore effort is going into those three areas,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I would argue not enough.\u201d This article originally appeared on Water Deeply .

Scientists Hit Breakthrough In Quest To Transplant Pig Organs Into Humans These little piggies could soon save millions of lives. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 10, 2017, 02:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A team of researchers in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have hit a breakthrough in their quest to develop pigs whose organs and other tissues can be transplanted into humans. The team, led by a biotechnology company called eGenesis , announced Thursday that it has successfully used a powerful gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to modify the DNA in pig cells and remove a number of viruses that make pig organs unsuitable for human transplant. ( Read more here on how CRISPR works and its potential for humans .) Advertisement Those virus-free cells were then used to fertilize several pig embryos, which were implanted in sows who have since given birth to virus-free pigs. eGenesis' pigs are the first to be free of a group of pig-specific viruses that make their organs unsuitable for human transplant. eGenesis It\u2019s a huge step, as those viruses (more specifically known as porcine endogenous retroviruses, or PERVs) pose a not-yet-fully-understood \u2015 but potentially significant \u2015 health threat to humans. Advertisement In a clinical trial in Europe, for example, researchers genetically modified a similar retrovirus from mice to help treat severe immunodeficiency in children. Most of the children benefited from the treatment , notes the Food and Drug Administration, but some developed leukemia. In other words, we don\u2019t need to know the exact effects of the viruses to know we don\u2019t want them around. Creating PERV-free pigs is the first step in a four-step process to ultimately create pig organs suitable for human transplant or \u201cxenotransplantation,\u201d Dr. Luhan Yang, a co-founder of eGenesis and the company\u2019s chief science officer, explained to HuffPost. Advertisement (Doctors have long used pig and cow valves to replace their leaky equivalents in the human heart, but kidneys and more complex organs represent a much bigger achievement.) Next, the company needs to make sure it can consistently replicate virus-free pigs, which it\u2019s already well on its way to doing. After that, Yang explained, it will need to test how the human immune system responds to the organs and modify them so they aren\u2019t rejected, creating what she referred to as \u201cpig 2.0,\u201d featuring \u201cadvanced immune compatibility.\u201d Advertisement Some challenges remain, notably engineering organs that aren't rejected by the human immune system, as illustrated in the top panels of this eGenesis-supplied illustration. CRISPR can help there, too. eGenesis Step four will be developing the infrastructure to produce and deliver lifesaving organs worldwide. Yang didn\u2019t want to speculate on a precise timeline for when xenotransplantation might be a common procedure, but the company is making very real, tangible progress toward that goal. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Monstrously 'Nasty' Ancient Crocodile Gets Named After Lemmy From Motorhead The croc was \"one of the biggest coastal predators of its time.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Aug 10, 2017, 04:14 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead received a posthumous honor when scientists lent his name to an ancient and \"nasty\" crocodile. Marc Broussely via Getty Images It\u2019s a fitting tribute for one of the true monsters of rock. Lemmy Kilmister , the gravel-voiced singer and founder of Motorhead who died two years ago, received the ultimate honor when British scientists named a prehistoric crocodile after him. Meet Crocodile Lemmysuchus, a 20-foot-long predator that lived 164 million years ago and was just as ferocious as a Motorhead song: Advertisement PR art for the newly named Lemmysuchus (yes, as in Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead). Geeky references and homages abound... https://t.co/Dkw3O3T0ch pic.twitter.com/SSNKRxgJ1b \u2014 Mark Witton (@MarkWitton) August 8, 2017 \u201cAlthough Lemmy passed away at the end of 2015, we\u2019d like to think that he would have raised a glass to Lemmysuchus , one of the nastiest sea creatures to have ever inhabited the Earth,\u201d Natural History Museum , London curator Lorna Steel said in a news release. This \u201cnasty\u201d creature \u2015 the croc, not Lemmy \u2015 lurked in shallow waters, where it \u201c would have been one of the biggest coastal predators of its time ,\u201d University of Edinburgh paleontologist Michela Johnson was quoted as saying. Advertisement While many of its telosaur relatives developed long snouts and thin teeth for catching and eating fish, Lemmysuchus went in its own direction. The creature\u2019s 3-foot-long skull evolved to have a broad snout and large teeth to crush the shells of turtles and other prey, the museum said. Lemmy may not have crushed turtle shells, but he was certainly known for his bone-shaking bass lines . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Although the croc specimen was found a century ago, it was incorrectly cataloged at the time. A more recent look at the fossils revealed a previously unknown creature, and that meant it needed a new name.

Polar Bears Meet For First Time And Become Instant BFFs When Nobby met Nissan ... By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 21, 2016, 03:48 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT You'd think they'd been friends forever. Polar bears Nobby and Nissan, both 2 years old, hit it off right away after meeting for the first time Friday at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park near Doncaster in northern England. Video posted online shows them rubbing noses, playfully hunting and swimming together: Nissan, who arrived at the park last year, gave Nobby the warm welcome after the latter's two-day, 1,000-mile journey to his new home from Munich Zoo in Germany. Advertisement \" Nissan was a bit muddy from playing out but he was keen to break off the fun to see what all the fuss was about when Nobby arrived,\" the park's animal manager Simon Marsh told the Doncaster Free Press. \"Polar bears are used to leaving their mothers at 2 years old and traveling around to find new groupings so this was a natural feeling for both of them. They clearly got along from the start,\" Marsh added. Advertisement Nissan and Nobby share the park's 10-acre Project Polar complex with 16-year-old Victor and 3-year-old Pixel. The park hopes the all-male group will prove key to protecting the species, threatened by disappearing habitat and hunting. \" Project Polar is one of the largest reserves in the world and a dynamic initiative for conservation, welfare and research,\" a statement said. Advertisement Wild polar bears are found in the U.S., Canada, Russia, Greenland and Norway, and do not live in the Southern Hemisphere . Females live for an average of 24.1 years and can grow to 8 feet tall and 550 pounds. Males live on average for 20.7 years and grow to 10 feet tall and 1,500 pounds. Disappearing sea ice is causing polar bear populations to plummet, with only 20,000 to 25,000 now in the wild. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Everything You Need To Know To Get Ready For The 'Great American Eclipse' Don't get caught in the dark -- unless you mean to. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 9, 2017, 05:51 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING For the first time in 99 years, a total solar eclipse will be visible on Aug. 21 to spectators across the contiguous United States. As the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, the 68-mile-wide shadow it casts (called the \u201cumbra\u201d) will sweep across the Earth\u2019s surface, moving around 1,200 mph along a path stretching from Oregon to South Carolina. Advertisement People in the center of the shadow\u2019s path will be plunged into darkness for no more than about two and a half minutes. The temperature may drop 20 or so degrees, depending on the location. The wind may suddenly change direction . Stars, planets and the moon will become visible. Some animals might prepare for bed. (Probably not cows, though. A 1999 study found eclipses have \u201clittle, if any effect\u201d on the ruminants.) What\u2019s it like? Here\u2019s how Mabel Loomis Todd, author of Total Eclipses of the Sun , described what she witnessed in 1894: Then, with frightful velocity, the actual shadow of the moon is often seen approaching, a tangible darkness advancing almost like a wall, swift as imagination, silent as doom. The immensity of nature never comes quite so near as then, and strong must be the nerves not to quiver as this blue-black shadow rushes upon the spectator with incredible speed. A vast, palpable presence seems to overwhelm the world. The blue sky changes to gray or dull purple, speedily becoming more dusky, and a death-like trance seizes upon everything earthly... Then out upon the darkness, gruesome but sublime, flashes the glory of the incomparable corona, a silvery, soft, unearthly light, with radiant streamers, stretching at times millions of uncomprehended miles into space, while the rosy, flame-like prominences skirt the black rim of the moon in ethereal splendor. It becomes curiously cold, dew frequently forms, and the chill is perhaps mental as well as physical. In short, it\u2019s something you probably don\u2019t want to miss. A total solar eclipse is seen in Longyearbyen on Svalbard, Norway, on March 20, 2015. Reuters Photographer / Reuters The earliest recorded total solar eclipse in human history can be attributed to the Chinese astrologers Hsi and Ho, who documented one on Oct. 22, 2134 B.C., according to NASA . But the Babylonians hold the record for the earliest successful prediction of a total solar eclipse: May 3, 1375 B.C. Advertisement The Vikings blamed eclipses on ravenous wolves eagerly chasing, and sometimes catching, the sun and moon as they raced across the sky. The Pomo tribe of the American northwest has a legend about the sun tussling with a bear . And the Serrano tribe in Southern California speculated the sun and moon were being consumed by the angry spirits of the dead. Fortunately, witnessing a total solar eclipse no longer means facing hungry wolves, angry bears or restless spirits from the underworld. (Unless you want to. To each their own.) Here\u2019s what you need to know: Never look at the sun without the proper equipment . Sunglasses alone aren\u2019t sufficient, no matter how many pairs you may stack together. Track down some eclipse glasses. Number 14 welding glasses will also do the trick. Advertisement If you already have some eclipse glasses, be aware that NASA recommends you not use any that are more than three years old, or any with scratched or wrinkled lenses. Alternatively, you can build a pinhole viewer out of a cereal box . The further from the central umbra you are, the more the experience will seem like a midday dimming rather than a surreal midday darkness. So you want to be as close to the center of the band in this interactive map as possible: Advertisement Around 12 million people live directly in the path of the solar eclipse, and an additional 200 million people live within a one-day drive of it. That means you should plan ahead for traffic, and lots of it. If you can arrive a day or two in advance and/or plan to stay at your destination for a while, you\u2019ll be a much happier camper. (Bonus points if you can spot Sasquatch at the same time .) Can\u2019t make it? Even if you can\u2019t make it to the narrow swath of land that will experience the umbra, the odds are pretty high you\u2019ll still bear witness to an incredible show. All of the lower 48 states will see a majority of the sun obscured: 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Science Behind How Cute 'Tuxedo' Cats Get Their Patchy Fur How piebald patches form on animal fur might help us better understand genetic diseases in humans. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 7, 2016, 03:24 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A new study explores how mammals get piebald patches on their fur, like the \"tuxedo\" cat seen here. Josh Tse aka Chaxiubao via Getty Images From the two-tone coats of cats that look like they're sporting dapper tuxedos to the distinctive piebald patterns flaunted by some horses , many animals that we've grown to love have fur marked by white patches . But where do these patches come from? Scientists previously thought that piebald patterns form when pigment-producing cells move too slowly to cover the entire body of a mammal while it's still growing in the womb, resulting in white patches on the skin and fur. Advertisement A new study published Wednesday contradicts that theory. Piebald patches may actually result from a failure of pigment-producing cells to multiply, Dr. Ian Jackson, professor of genetics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"These cells originate from alongside the developing spinal cord and move through the developing skin so that they cover the whole body,\" he said. \"The piebald patches on animals, including humans, are almost always caused by a failure of these cells to fully populate the whole skin.\" For the study, published in the journal Nature Communications , the researchers took a close look at how pigment-producing cells behave in mouse embryos that have a mutated gene called Kit , since such gene mutations are linked to piebald patches. Then, the researchers created a math model based on their observations. Advertisement \u201cIn addition to Kit, there are many other genes that can create piebald patterns,\" Dr. Christian Yates, a mathematical biologist at the University of Bath in England and a co-author of the study, told The Telegraph. \"The mathematical model can explain piebald patterns regardless of the genes involved .\" This cute mouse has black-and-white piebald patterning. TinkerJulie via Getty Images The model showed that although there were not enough pigment-producing cells to cover a mouse's whole body, they efficiently moved at random and spread though the whole skin. The discovery was quite a surprise, Dr. Richard Mort, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh and a co-author of the study, said in a statement. Advertisement \"Using a mathematical model we were then able to show that this simple process could explain piebald patterns ,\" he said. Because the model describes the movement and growth of cells, the researchers noted that it could be used to help scientists better understand genetic diseases associated with a deficit of cells moving to the right positions in the body. Such diseases include Waardenburg syndrome , which can cause hearing loss and changes in pigmentation on the body, and Hirschsprung's disease , which impacts the large intestine. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Terrifying Clip Shows Why You Should Never Run Under A Tree During Thunderstorms YIKES! By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost May 17, 2018, 05:19 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT \u26a1\ufe0fDuring a thunderstorm - standing under a tree is literally the WORST place to be. \u26a1\ufe0fDuring a thunderstorm - even sitting in a parked car under a tree is dangerous due to falling limbs from lightning and wind. \u26a1\ufe0fImagine how many people don't know this? #WeatherReady pic.twitter.com/S0FIR16oer \u2014 NWS (@NWS) May 16, 2018 With summer approaching, the National Weather Service (NWS) has posted some sage advice about what not to do during a thunderstorm : Don\u2019t run under a tree to avoid lightning . In a tweet posted on Wednesday, the agency called it \u201cliterally the WORST place to be\u201d and shared a clip showing what happens when lightning strikes a tree. Advertisement \u201c Most lightning deaths or injuries occur when people are on a golf course, near water or standing under trees for shelter,\u201d the NWS wrote in a bulletin posted last year. The agency\u2019s safety campaigns have been credited with helping to reduce the number of lightning deaths annually. USA Today reported last year that when the NWS launched its first \u201cwhen thunder roars, go indoors\u201d campaign in 2001, the U.S. averaged 55 lightning deaths per year. That number has steadily dropped, and last year it reached an all-time low of 17. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t like to see any lightning deaths, the continuing downward trend in yearly fatalities is encouraging ,\u201d meteorologist John Jensenius told the newspaper. Advertisement The clip, released by the NWS this week, shows a 2016 strike at Bishop Thomas K. Gorman Catholic School in Tyler, Texas: While lightning can strike any time of year, it\u2019s most common in summer during the late afternoon and evening. The highest incidence of lightning strikes occurs around the Gulf Coast. Advertisement The agency advises people to head indoors when they hear thunder. If that\u2019s not possible, a closed automobile was the next-best option. \u201c Stay away from trees, power poles, antennae and away from lakes, ponds and water ,\u201d the NWS said. \u201cStay away from metal objects such as fences, railroad tracks and metal bleachers.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Light From A Black Hole Seen With A Telescope For The First Time The black hole awakened after 26 years of inactivity. By Samantha Guff Associate Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 7, 2016, 06:38 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Space.com Anything that gets sucked into a black hole is gone forever, including light. But occasionally, black holes may experience a phenomenon in which the substances falling into them release enormous amounts of energy that can appear as light. For the first time ever, astronomers were able to observe this violent outburst of flickering light near a black hole using an ordinary 20-centimeter telescope, according to The Guardian -- an instrument popular with amateur stargazers. Advertisement These bursts of light occur when nearby space material falls into a black hole and causes a friction-fueled explosion. The dramatic way that this light fluctuates provides insight into the little-known ways that matter can be absorbed by a black hole , according to Live Science. This video shows a glimpse of the flickering light as recorded over a 3.5-hour period: Advertisement Black holes that have nearby stars are capable of coming to life every once in a while. But until now, scientists have only observed similar explosions of light as intense flashes of X-rays and gamma rays. Japanese researchers detected this glow around the newly active black hole V404 Cygni in June, after it had awakened from a 26-year period of inactivity, according to Tech Times. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

New Photo Shows Pluto's 'Heart' Actually A Vast, Frozen Wasteland Warm and fuzzy from afar, cold and barren up close. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Jul 17, 2015, 04:35 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA/JHUAPL/SWRI Pluto's heart-shaped area has been wooing earthlings since NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured an image of the 1,200-mile-wide feature last week. Unfortunately, it's not as adorable as it may seem. Gotta LOVE Pluto! RTs! pic.twitter.com/ID9u7F2rea \u2014 NewHorizons2015 (@NewHorizons2015) July 9, 2015 Advertisement A portion of the heart is actually a huge frozen plain that may contain carbon monoxide ice , according to data the space agency released Friday. Scientists believe the area, informally named the \"Sputnik Plains,\" is relatively young -- no more than 100 million years old -- because it doesn't have any craters. \" This terrain is not easy to explain ,\" Jeff Moore, leader of the New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging Team (GGI) at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, said in a release. \"The discovery of vast, craterless, very young plains on Pluto exceeds all pre-flyby expectations.\" Advertisement The plains are bordered by 11,000-foot-tall mountains scientists believe are made of frozen water rather than frozen methane or nitrogen, which are found elsewhere around Pluto. \"At Pluto\u2019s temperatures, water-ice behaves more like rock,\" deputy GGI lead Bill McKinnon of Washington University, St. Louis, explained in a separate statement .

This Is What Climate Change Has Done To The Great Barrier Reef Researchers say the widespread coral bleaching across the vast ecosystem is the worst on record. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 29, 2016, 06:42 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A patch of bleached coral stands out in a section of the Great Barrier Reef photographed during a recent survey of the structure's health. Credit: ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies A new aerial survey of the Great Barrier Reef shows the vast extent of a \"severe\" bleaching event that's caused widespread coral death over the past several weeks. The National Coral Bleaching Taskforce study found 95 percent of individual reefs in the most pristine section of the ecosystem showed severe bleaching. The research covered 520 reefs across more than 600 miles of coastline and found just four that didn't show signs of damage. Advertisement Coral becomes \"bleached\" when the usually kaleidoscopic reefs are harmed by warmer oceans or other environmental factors . The colorful algae that feed coral polyps leave the structures during times of stress, leading to the ghostly white appearance . Coral takes on a ghostly white appearance once bleached. The bleaching can spread and entire structures can die if the oceans don't normalize. Credit: ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies If the stressors go away -- the ocean cools down or pollutants dissipate -- the algae is able to return and coral can recover. Advertisement If the oceans don't normalize, the bleaching can spread and entire structures can die. That's exactly what's happening across the Great Barrier Reef, the largest living structure on Earth. Terry Hughes , a professor at Australia's James Cook University and the convener of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce, said the data reflected the worst widespread bleaching across the reef ever seen. Up to 50 percent of the damaged coral could die, he said. The last major bleaching event in 2002 only saw 18 percent of reefs severely damaged. A band of starkly white coral that has been bleached in the latest event. Credit: ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies Advertisement Hughes said the prime driver behind the bleaching is warmer temperatures caused by man-made climate change . Corals are highly sensitive to even minuscule temperature shifts, and a prolonged increase of just 1 degree Celsius above normal for a few weeks can cause bleaching. \"In each case, the bleaching mapped perfectly onto where the hottest water was occurring,\" Hughes said. \"There's a very clear link.\" The dire photos have prompted Australia's environment minister to raise the reef's threat rating to its highest level. But some have criticized the government's conservation response so far, as the most recent proposal to protect the reef failed to name climate change as the main culprit behind the region's woes.

Meet The Woman Who Launched A New Field Of Scientific Study \"I hope that women will see that one can have a rewarding career in science and technology,\" says Dr. Frances Arnold. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post May 31, 2016, 12:22 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Dr. Frances Arnold is the first woman ever to win the prestigious Millennium Technology Prize. Caltech As a female chemical engineer, Frances Arnold was already a rarity. After all, only about 16 percent of chemical engineers are women . But now that she has become the first woman ever to win the prestigious Millennium Technology Prize \u2014 it was awarded in Helsinki, Finland, on May 24 \u2014 Arnold is truly one of a kind. Advertisement And she knows that in addition to a big cash award (1 million euros, or about $1.3 million), the prize brings an opportunity to spotlight the gender gap in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) careers and to be a role model for other women. \"I hope that my getting this prize will highlight the fact that yes, women can do this, they can do it well, and that they can make a contribution to the world and be recognized for it,\" Arnold told The Huffington Post in an email. \"I hope that women will see that one can have a rewarding career in science and technology.\" Arnold, 59, won the prize for \"her discoveries that launched a field known as directed evolution ,\" according to a statement issued by Technology Academy Finland, the organization that awards the prize. To learn more about the field, and about Arnold herself, HuffPost Science posed a series of questions to her via email. Here, lightly edited, are her answers: Advertisement Did you always want to be a scientist? I did not choose to become a researcher until I was almost 30. I tried other careers, but science spoke to me more and more, especially after I started studying the biological world and all the amazing molecular machines made by nature. As a little girl, I thought I might be a heart surgeon, CEO of a multinational company or even a diplomat some day (until I figured out I had no diplomatic skills). When I went to college, I never really thought about being a scientist or an engineer, but of course that was always on the list of possibilities. I had tried lots of odd jobs \u2014 from taxi driver to waitress to assembling electronic devices \u2014 and later a few science and technology jobs in nuclear power and solar energy. But I loved languages, I enjoyed economics, I spent every break traveling and seeing different cultures. I loved learning and did not think too much about the future until one day it happened! Advertisement Why do women continue to be underrepresented in engineering and other STEM fields? Because talented women choose to do other things. But if they knew how important technology is for supporting our well-being and that of the planet, and how fun it can be, more would choose STEM fields. What barriers keep women from choosing STEM careers? I believe that some women still face external barriers, but other barriers are more self-imposed: lack of confidence or desire to compete and a misunderstanding of what science and technology can contribute to society. Science is not for everyone; it takes a lot of time and devotion to become really good, and the same is true for engineering. You have to love it. What I see is that the most talented women have many opportunities. Whether they choose to pursue science or engineering depends on how they feel about their whole life experience, perhaps more so than men. Opportunities today are excellent, but there are challenges to having a family and competing at the highest levels that women often feel more acutely . Advertisement What can be done to eliminate these barriers? At the very least, girls should not be discouraged from using their natural talents in mathematics and science. Even better, they should be encouraged and praised. What's a typical workday like for you? Rich, never boring, something new and interesting every day. Full of brilliant young people who want to change the world. So now about your research -- what is directed evolution? It's a technology that allows us to reliably create improved proteins for a wide range of applications. Just as farmers and breeders have used artificial selection processes over thousands of years to create higher-yielding crops or pets that please us, we can direct the evolution of proteins to perform better in applications, from laundry detergents to green chemistry . Advertisement Modern methods of DNA manipulation allow us to make iterations of mutations and artificial selection on a gene rather than in an organism, and to shorten the generation time to a few days. That way we can accumulate beneficial mutations in the gene that encodes the protein, making it better and better until it meets our needs. What makes proteins so important? Proteins are the workhorses of life, responsible for nearly all the interesting things we and other organisms can do. Just one (very important) class of proteins, the enzymes are responsible for turning food (for example, for some microbes this means sunlight, carbon dioxide, sugar, etc.) into all the materials and energy needed to support life and reproduce life. That\u2019s pretty amazing chemistry, and we should learn how to harness that for our own purposes. We have already been using microbes and the enzymes in them to improve our lives for thousands of years, from making bread, beer, wine, cheese -- to, more recently, having laundry detergents that take stains off of clothes in cold water (thus saving significant energy), making fuels and chemicals from renewable resources or making drugs to treat diabetes. Advertisement How does directed evolution differ from evolution as we commonly think of it? It differs from natural evolution in that it is directed by the researcher. Mutations are directed (by me) to a specific gene, and since the researcher has a goal in mind, it is also directed in that sense. This slide, provided by Arnold, shows the process of directed evolution. Frances Arnold How is directed evolution being used commercially? Directed evolution has had big impact in the fields of drug synthesis. Many popular drugs, including the cholesterol-lowering drugs simvastatin and atorvastatin, have been developed with the help of directed evolution. The same is true for making consumer products (key ingredients for creams, laundry detergents, animal and human nutrition products and many more) and for making non-ethanol fuels like isobutanol from renewable plant resources. Advertisement What are the biggest advances that have come from the commercial application of directed evolution? My former student and one of the first people to use directed evolution, Dr. Jeffrey Moore, and his collaborators figured out how to manufacture the diabetes drug Januvia using an evolved enzyme. Their process replaces chemical methods that were far from optimal, lowering the cost of the drug and especially the waste products. Their process won many awards, including the President's Green Chemistry Challenge . Many companies now incorporate enzyme catalysts into their processes. More will do so as we move to greater sustainability in manufacturing. A number of companies that make fuels and chemicals from renewable resources have used DE to optimize enzymes. Enzymes optimized by directed evolution are being used to make nutritional products for humans and animals, fuel from biomass and to test new drugs for toxicity. They are being used directly to treat human disease. Advertisement Engineered enzymes are used in everything from DNA sequencing to glucose sensors for diabetes, laundry detergents and food processing. What do you foresee for directed evolution in the future? The wonderful thing about directed evolution is that it is both simple and general. Because the technology is accessible, it can be implemented in any laboratory. It opened up a new way for people to look at the inventions of the biological world and fit them into their own creations. So many clever people all over the world have taken this technology and done all manner of brilliant things with it, things I would never have thought of. This will continue in the future. Advertisement What are you going to do with all that prize money? I will use some of it to invest in work done at Provivi, a startup I cofounded with two of my former students, Peter Meinhold and Pedro Coelho. Provivi is developing the non-toxic alternatives to pesticides, which I think is such an important goal. Why so important? Pesticides get into our food, streams and rivers and cause all manner of harm. Imagine spraying a little bit of \"perfume\" in a field to confuse the insect pests so that they can't mate. If they can't mate they are not going to damage your crops. Wouldn't it be wonderful to do that instead of dumping highly toxic pesticides? Our hope is to make these complicated insect perfumes quite cheaply using enzymes. Is there a particular scientific question you're trying to answer? I am very interested in the evolution of novelty \u2014 how do new functions appear in the biological world. I am tackling this question by evolving enzyme catalysts that catalyze chemical reactions not known in the biological world.

The Microbes Living In Your Home Say A Lot About You \"We live in a microbial zoo.\" By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 28, 2015, 09:55 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There are thousands of microbial species crawling around your home right now -- and they can reveal a lot about you and anyone else who lives there. That's according to a study published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B . The study reveals the surprising amount of microbial diversity in the average household, and what kinds of secrets those microbes hold. Advertisement What exactly can scientists learn about you from a single sample of the dust in your house? \"We can, to some degree, figure out where you live (or at the least the climate where you live), [and] who you might live with (including dogs and cats),\" Dr. Noah Fierer, a microbial ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"More generally, we can figure out what potential allergens you may be exposed to inside your home.\" For the study, the researchers examined roughly 1,200 homes across the U.S., analyzing the indoor and outdoor dust at each home. The researchers found that, on average, most homes contain more than 5,000 different species of bacteria and around 2,000 species of fungi. Advertisement But don't panic. As Fierer told the Los Angeles Times, most of these household microbes are completely harmless, and some may even be beneficial. The researchers also analyzed which factors influence each home's different fungal and bacterial communities. \"For fungi, the biggest influence appears to be where your house is located,\" Fierer told HuffPost. \"For bacteria, it appears to be the human and non-human animals (i.e. dogs and cats) that you live with.\" Advertisement (Story continues below.) This scanning electron microscope image shows the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis, one of many bacteria species found on human skin. Credit: Media for Medical via Getty Images For instance, bacteria found in your home can vary depending on the number of men and women who live there, Live Science reported. Clues to the men-to-women ratio in a home can be found in many of the local microbe populations, including skin, vaginal and even armpit bacteria . Meanwhile, the kinds of fungi residing in and around your home will vary according to your location. For example, you get different kinds of fungi if you live near a beach than you would if you live in the mountains. Advertisement \"One of the key takeaways is that if you want to change what you breathe inside your house , you would either have to move very far away or change the people and the pets you live with,\" Albert Barbar\u00e1n, a graduate researcher at the university and lead author of the study, said in a press release. The researchers noted that their findings could be used to help forensic investigations, as well as to better our understanding of the microbes that we often forget we share our humble abodes with. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The California Drought's Alarming Toll On Forests The California Drought's Alarming Toll On Forests Jane Braxton Little \u2014 Water Deeply Feb 19, 2016, 07:09 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT 120 million trees across California are at risk of dying, recent research has found. MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images New research using high-tech tools to measure the moisture in trees found that 120 million trees across nearly every part of California are at risk of dying. Predictions that trends of higher temperatures and decreased precipitation will continue in the future could transform the state\u2019s forests. California is littered with dead trees. Four years of drought have pushed countless lone pines and forests alike to the brink of collapse, turning entire swathes of mountains from verdant to withering rust. The numbers began rolling in early last summer with a U.S. Forest Service survey that tallied the death toll at 12 million. By September the agency revised its count to 21 million trees statewide. Soon the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), weighed in with 29 million confirmed dead trees. Dead trees are seen by a dried up section of New Melones Lake, California. The state has endured four dry summers and four winters with a dramatically reduced snowpack. MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images Even those grim numbers, gathered through conventional on-the-ground and aerial estimates, were upended by a high-tech assessment done by scientists with the Carnegie Institution for Science. Four dry summers and four winters with a dramatically reduced snowpack have taken a toll throughout the Golden State, and will likely kill 58 million trees due to severe water loss, said Greg Asner, a Carnegie Institution biologist who published his results online on December 28 in Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences. As many as 120 million trees statewide are in jeopardy from loss of water in their canopies, he said. The higher temperatures and reduced precipitation that contributed to the die-off are widely predicted to continue, leaving California's forests poised for radical transformation. \"If drought conditions continue or reoccur, even with temporary reprieves such as El Ni\u00f1o, we predict substantial future forest change,\" Asner and his co-authors wrote. They spent the summer doing aerial surveys throughout the state using remote sensing and modeling techniques that allowed them to look beyond what the naked eye can see to the motions of water molecules. Asner's twin turboprop Dornier 228 carried an onboard spectrometer and laser equipment that measured the water content inside a leaf or needle. The more water in the leaves, the less reflected light; the more reflected light, the drier the foliage. Dead and dying trees are seen in Los Padres National Forest, California. The state's governor, Jerry Brown, declared a state of emergency over the dying trees. David McNew/Getty Images Asner converted the 3-D images his equipment captured into topographic maps, which left little doubt about the hot spots. Virtually every corner of California has been affected by the drought, from the forests of the southern Sierra Nevada to the state's northwest. Asner called the mountains ringing Los Angeles \"a tinderbox.\" The oak forests in the Sierra Foothills are \"in big trouble,\" and Pinnacles is \"not a happy place for a tree,\" he said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Even the forests northwest of Redding are \"surprisingly compromised,\" Asner said. His survey found the trees vulnerable due to extreme water loss represent 20 percent of the state's total. Advertisement Asner's assessments, combined with those from the state and federal agencies, contributed to Gov. Jerry Brown's October declaration of a state of emergency over dying trees. Brown called it \u201cthe worst epidemic of tree mortality\u201d in the state\u2019s modern history. He ordered state agencies to remove dead or dying trees from high-hazard areas and proposed expanding the number of days when tree waste can be burned. That has triggered a variety of activities aimed at reducing the spread of insects infesting drought-weakened and standing dead trees, which are vulnerable to fire. This month CAL FIRE announced $1.7 million in grants to six central Sierra counties. Local projects will focus on removing dead and dying trees to reduce the wildfire threat around homes within Fresno, Kern, Madera, Mariposa, Tulare and Tuolumne counties, said Daniel Berlant, an agency spokesperson. A U.S. Forest Service firefighter attempts to put out fires in burning embers in the El Dorado National Forest near Georgetown, California. Local projects and partnerships are mobilizing around improving forest health and minimizing the effects of wildfires. Rich Pedroncelli/ASSOCIATED PRESS Advertisement Partnerships are also mobilizing around the use of prescribed fire to improve forest health and minimize the effects of wildfires. The last several years have been a wake-up call urging more attention to putting fire back on the landscape in a more sophisticated way, said Jim Branham, executive officer for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. Other groups are analyzing the availability and placement of resources such as chippers and log-loaders. Their goal is to mobilize equipment in high-priority areas, moving it around much the way agencies relocate fire equipment, said Berlant. Thinning forests and reducing accumulated biomass will improve the health of forests generally and make them more resilient to fire, said David Bischel, president of the California Forestry Association. \"If we are not proactive, wildfire impacts will threaten water quality and supply at a time when we need it most,\" he said. Along with a flurry of activity, Brown's dead-trees emergency declaration triggered alarm among some environmentalists, who questioned its exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act to boost efforts to remove dead or dying trees. Brian Nowicki of the Center for Biological Diversity challenged Brown's connection between dead trees and wildfire risk, emphasizing the need to maintain forests for wildlife habitat. Center officials also objected to the unrestricted waiver of air quality regulations. A tree biologist climbs a tree to retrieve a sensor measuring temperature and humidity at Sequoia National Park. Federal scientists say California's forest emergency actually foreshadows a series of effects that may affect the larger ecosystem. Rich Pedroncelli/ASSOCIATED PRESS A February 1 report issued by the U.S. Forest Service puts California's forest emergency in the longer-term perspective of a changing climate. The 300-page report cited worsening drought conditions in California and throughout the West that may be more than their ecosystems can handle: \"There is growing consensus that extreme precipitation events will increase in frequency, and warmer temperatures will exacerbate the impacts of drought on forests and rangelands in the future.\" Predictions like this foreshadow a series of cascading effects that reach far beyond dead and dying trees. We can, the federal scientists say, expect an increase in bark beetles. Insect infestations are currently the most important biotic cause of tree mortality, killing hundreds of millions of trees throughout the West as temperatures have warmed and precipitation has declined. Dead trees are more vulnerable to fire than green trees. The West has already seen fire seasons that start sooner in the spring and last longer into the fall, adding a total of 78 days beyond the average fire season four decades ago. Scientists predict an increase of up to 125 percent in the areas that burn in California. More indirectly, the drought-killed trees will affect the water produced in the nation's forests and the 60 million people who depend on it, the Forest Service report states. As water quantities slow with less precipitation, a concentration of nutrients and sediments reduces the water quality. Most ominously, the combination of dead trees, insect infestation and fire on forest ecosystems will likely release carbon \u2013 perhaps more, in some places, than forests store. This could culminate in a feedback loop that adds to global carbon accumulations, said Matt Jolly, a Forest Service researcher and fire ecologist whose study was published in Nature Communications. The widespread die-off of trees is disquieting wherever it occurs, but it evokes particular anxiety in California, host to the tallest, most massive and oldest trees on Earth. The response demands looking beyond the immediate emergency to the long-term impacts of climate change, said James Vose, a Forest Service research ecologist. Something \"quite large-scale\" is happening in California, North America and across the globe. \u201cThis is and will continue to be a major challenge for forest and rangeland managers \u2013 certainly if the current drought continues or gets worse,\u201d he said.

SeaWorld Orca Mom Too 'Depressed' To Nurse Her Calf, Experts Say In a new video, Kasatka appears to behave \"abnormally\" towards her baby. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Oct 22, 2015, 03:38 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A mother orca living in captivity at SeaWorld San Diego is so depressed that she\u2019s unable to nurse her calf , according to two whale experts who recently visited the ocean park. Marine biologist Ingrid Visser and former SeaWorld trainer John Hargrove were accompanied by the film crew of \" Superpod ,\" an upcoming orca documentary project, during their visit. The pair say they spotted a mother orca named Kasatka behaving strangely. Advertisement In footage that captured the mother\u2019s interaction with her calf, 2-year-old Makani can be seen bumping repeatedly into Kasatka\u2019s belly. This head-bumping, Hargrove explains in the clip, is a \"precursor to nursing.\" Kasatka, however, seems to ignore Makani\u2019s prompts. The mother orca has even developed a bruise on her stomach from her baby\u2019s persistent bumping, Visser said. \"That's just because the calf is constantly trying to get food, so desperately hungry, so bored,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a stereotypic behavior now.\" Advertisement Naomi Rose, a leading orca researcher at the Animal Welfare Institute, confirmed to The Dodo that Kasatka does appear to be behaving abnormally in the clip. \"If I saw a calf head-bumping its mother over and over and nothing coming of it (no nursing observed), then I would definitely consider that abnormal ,\" Rose said. \"Normally when a calf solicits nursing that way, the mother nurses!\" Advertisement \"The calf is probably not getting the milk it needs,\" she added. According to Hargrove, who worked as a senior orca trainer at SeaWorld for years before becoming an anti-captivity advocate , Kasatka is \"so depressed, [she\u2019s] incapable of taking care of her calf.\" SeaWorld, however, has issued a rebuttal to this claim. \"Makani 'bumping' Kasatka is a commonly observed bonding behavior, and there is no bruising present,\" the company told HuffPost in a statement. \"[Visser and Hargrove] have confused a fully weaned killer whale with a nursing baby. Makani is fully weaned and eats about 65 pounds of fish a day.\" (Read SeaWorld's entire rebuttal here .) Animal rights activists maintain that the stress of captivity can greatly harm orcas , and may even provoke violence. Advertisement Earlier this month, the California Coastal Commission voted to ban orca breeding at SeaWorld San Diego after the ocean park submitted plans requesting an expansion of its killer whale tank. The commission okayed the plan, but said the approval came \"with conditions.\" \"[Orcas] don't belong in captivity,\" Dayna Bochno, one of the commissioners, said. SeaWorld said it will challenge the commission\u2019s ruling . This post has been updated to include SeaWorld's comments.

When NASA Had Nuclear Rockets Most people think that Star Trek-style nuclear rockets are a thing of the future, but the fact is we had them in the 1960s... and gave up on them.

Most people think that Star Trek-style nuclear rockets are a thing of the future, but the fact is we had them in the 1960s... and gave up on them. The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application...NERVA... program was a joint effort between NASA and the US Atomic Energy Commission, and managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office. Los Alamos Labs had begun work on nuclear rockets in 1952 and this research accelerated so quickly that by 1961 the Marshall Spaceflight Center started using nuclear rockets in their mission planning, with the first launch to be in 1964 as a final demonstration of the space-worthiness of these engines. The NERVA engine was built by Aerojet and Westinghouse. The first of these actually built and tested in a spaceflight configuration was the Kiwi-B4 engine that produced 70,000 pounds of thrust. The NERVA NRX/EST engine in 1966 ran for two continuous hours. The NERVA-XE engine tests ran for 115 minutes and as a result, it demonstrated that nuclear engines were now flight-ready as a technology. The nuclear engine program had demonstrated thrusts as high as 250,000 pounds, 90 minutes of continuous and controllable thrust delivery, and thermal power equal to 4,500 megawatts. Advertisement The plan was to use a NERVA engine as the third stage of the Saturn V rocket and plausibly get to Mars by 1978 and even use this engine as the work-horse to establish a large lunar colony by 1981. These plans were canceled in 1972 once President Nixon came into office and decided that the Saturn V and the Apollo program were no longer needed to prove US space superiority in the Cold War. Without the Saturn V, there was no way to place the heavy nuclear engine into space, even though once there it would dramatically out-perform any chemical rocket. Nuclear engines would be used as the engines for space 'tugboats' that would ferry cargo and humans from low earth orbit to the moon and beyond. A conceptual illustration of a spacecraft for a manned Mars mission proposed by NASA's Wernher von Braun in August 1969. Two spacecraft would make the trip in tandem, each one powered by three NERVA-type engines. (Image courtesy: NASA). The Space Nuclear Propulsion Office planned to build ten nuclear engine-based vehicles, six for ground tests and four for flight tests, but the development program was delayed after 1966 as NERVA became a political hot-potato in the debate over a Mars mission. The nuclear -enhanced Saturn 5 would carry two to three times more payload into space than the chemical version, enough to easily loft 340,000 pound space stations and replenish orbital propellant depots. Ultimately the NERVA program became so closely linked to plans to go to Mars, that when Congress finally balked at the expense and folly of going to Mars, the NERVA program no longer had a 'customer' to serve. The NERVA program was finally terminated altogether on January 5, 1973. So for decades, the popular story seemed to be that we didn't have nuclear rocket technology and would have to get by with impressive chemical rocket-based systems like the Space Shuttle. But then something amazing happened. In 2000, NASA proposed Project Prometheus whose goal was to develop nuclear-powered systems for long-duration space missions. Now, this wasn't nuclear engine technology, but the far more practical power plant technology. NASA had for decades been shoehorned into missions that used heavy solar panels or 'RTG' to generate a few hundred watts to run scientific equipment. Now NASA wanted to leap into multi-kilowatt systems based on small nuclear fission piles. Advertisement For the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO), a spacecraft designed to explore Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, NASA intended to use the first of what they hoped would be the new generation of mini-reactors flown in space. The reactor would heat a fluid and run a steam turbine to generate electricity. The electricity would then power scientific instruments and an ion-propulsion unit. But this was not to be either. The JIMO mission was cancelled in 2006, and also canceled was the Prometheus Project. NASA chief, Mike Griffin, told a U.S. Senate subcommittee in May 2005 that JIMO was in his opinion, \" too ambitious to be attempted .\" Instead, the Juno mission to Jupiter was funded, and this $1.1 billion spacecraft carries huge solar panels to generate its electricity using conservative 'off the shelf' technology. The NEXT ion engine in operation. But at least there are ion engines! Nothing is ever lost, so at least in principle nuclear rocket technology is ready to go just as soon as we can decide that we want to do more in space that just the limited capabilities that chemical rockets allow. Meanwhile, ion propulsion is being used by NASA increasingly, and with spectacular results. Three NASA missions, SERT-1, Dawn and Deep Space 1, used ion engines to get around in the solar system. Although the thrust of these engines is measured in ounces not in kilopounds, the thrust can be maintained for weeks, months and years, which steadily builds up enormous speeds. For example, it took four days for the Dawn spacecraft to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph using a thrust of just 0.3 ounces. How an ion engine works (Credit NASA) SERT-I and II launched in 1964 and 1970, verified ion thruster technology in space and ran for up to 3700 hours. This technology was then used on the Deep Space-1 mission. Advertisement The Dawn mission, launched in 2007 traveling a total of 3 billion miles, has now visited asteroid Vesta (2011) and dwarf planet Ceres (2015) using a 10 kilowatt ion engine system, 937 pounds of xenon, and achieved a record-breaking speed change of 10 kilometers/sec, some 2.5 times greater than the DS-1 spacecraft. The NASA NEXT program in 2010 demonstrated over 5.5 years of continuous operation for a 7 kilowatt ion engine. It used 1,900 pounds of xenon and produced a thrust of 0.8 pounds. Advertisement Basically, the thrust you get depends on 1) the voltage used to accelerate the ions, controlled by the wattage of the engine, 2) the rate at which you pump the ions through the engine and 3) the mass of the ions. Currently we are using a few thousand volts, a few kilowatts, xenon atoms with an atomic mass of 131, and a low-pressure flow rate of about 5 ounces per hour. This gives you a thrust of just under one ounce. Imagine what you could do with a megawatt engine and a 100,000 volt potential with a mass flow rate of 1 kilograms per day and a thrust of 100 pounds! (well,these numbers may not be consistent with each other, but you get the point!) Now we are talking getting to Mars in a week or less! These are baby steps, but they prove loud and clear that the only thing limiting 'Star Trek' rocketry is our human will to explore and dream. These are qualities in short supply on Capitol Hill and by American adults in general, but we can no longer hide behind the lame excuse that we just don't have the technology! We do...we just don't care.

Scientists Take Huge Step Toward Universal Flu Vaccine The yearly flu shot could soon be a thing of the past. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 28, 2015, 03:55 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A universal flu vaccine -- one that provides immunity against every strain of the influenza virus for multiple years -- is the holy grail of flu research. It would be a medical breakthrough on the order of penicillin, with the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives every year. And scientists just got one crucial step closer to making it a reality. Two separate groups of scientists published papers this week demonstrating that a new type of flu vaccine can provide protection against multiple strains of the disease, rather than just one. Though a truly universal flu vaccine that could be given to humans remains years away, infectious disease experts hailed the new findings as a major breakthrough . Advertisement \"These are very good papers. There are no problems with them,\" Dr. Peter Palese, a renowned flu expert at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, told The Huffington Post. \"What we need to do now is put [these vaccines] in humans and see if they work. That's the only question at this point.\" One group of researchers, whose findings were published in the journal Nature Medicine , tested the new type of vaccine on mice and ferrets, while the other group, which published its paper in Science , tested it on monkeys. Both teams found that the vaccine increased the test subjects' immunity against both the H1N1 flu type, often called \"swine flu,\" and the H5N1 type, or \"bird flu.\" Until now, all flu vaccines have only been able to protect against one specific strain of flu. Even if it's determined that the new vaccine type can work in humans, years of clinical trials will be needed before such vaccines could come to market. But if the research pans out, experts believe that within the decade, we could have a vaccine that protects against all strains of influenza for years on end. Advertisement \u201cThe goal would be to try to make it so that you don't have to get immunized every year -- but maybe once every five or 10 years. That would be a major step forward.\u201d American virologists Jonas Salk (1914-1995) and Thomas Francis (1900-1969) developed the first-ever flu vaccines in 1938. Every vaccine developed since then has operated on the same basic principle: The vaccines lead the human immune system to produce antibodies that attach to the end of the flu virus's hemagglutinin, the part that the virus uses to access our cells. The antibodies prevent the virus from successfully invading the cells and causing disease. But the reason vaccines can protect against only a single strain of the flu is that the ends of the hemagglutinin are structured differently in each strain. Advertisement Flu shots generally contain three or four different types of vaccines, so they can offer immunity to the handful of strains that scientists predict will be most common in a given season. But the flu virus can change its genetic makeup so quickly that the ends of its hemagglutinin change completely from year to year, which is why a vaccine given one year confers little to no immunity from a subsequent year's flu strains. Hence the need to get a flu shot every fall. But the scientists who wrote the two papers published this week took an entirely different approach. Instead of targeting the invasive ends of the hemagglutinin, they targeted the \"stems,\" which connect the ends to the rest of the virus. Since the structure of these stems doesn't vary much between different strains of the flu, an antibody that attacks the stem should defuse a wide variety of strains. Scientists never even thought to develop vaccines aiming at the hemagglutinin stems until recently, because it only became clear a few years ago that humans produced antibodies that targeted the stems. Advertisement That's partially because humans don't produce very many of these antibodies. And it's still unclear whether any vaccine could spur our immune systems to produce enough stem-targeted antibodies to fight off flu strains. Even if a vaccine can trigger production of a sufficient quantity of stem-targeted antibodies, no one knows how long the body will do so after vaccination, so we have no idea how long any immunity conferred by such flu shots would last. \"In a perfect world, it would last for life,\" said Dr. Ian Wilson of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, who is one of the authors of the Science paper. \"But we have no idea how long it will last for the moment. The goal would be to try to make it so that you don't have to get immunized every year -- but maybe once every five or 10 years. That would be a major step forward.\" Advertisement Still, one concern is that flu viruses could start to vary the structures of their stems more widely than they currently do, mitigating the advantage of this new type of vaccine. \"It's a constant arms race with all of these viruses,\" Wilson said. \"Basically, the immune system can neutralize the virus that's infected with, then the virus escapes, and the immune system attacks the new virus \u2026 This is a constant process with all viruses.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Having just published a book on the origin and synthesis of life, I was fascinated to learn that I'd missed interviewing one of the field's most provocative scientists -- virologist Luis Perez Villarreal -- who takes a \"virus-first\" perspective to life. But Villarreal, founding director of the Center for Virus Research, University of California at Irvine, says he acknowledges that he is a bit of an outsider in the sense that his virus-first perspective is somewhat dismissed by traditional biologists. Nevertheless, Villarreal's thinking draws applause in Europe and he is among the first experts the American mainstream media consults when viruses like Ebola and HIV loom large in the news. But part of the reason why such viruses linger in the news, Villarreal says, is the fact that we are spinning our wheels by regarding evolution as a linear process when it is clearly nonlinear. In fact, Villarreal thinks we need a new language to deal with the dynamic of viruses, which exist as nonlinear collective entities, i.e ., consortia. He considers viruses active organisms that are not only the biggest component of the biomass but comprise 10% of the human genome. Villarreal goes as far as saying that \"all living habitats . . . have and must operate in a virosphere\" -- Ex virus omnia (from virus everything) is his motto. Luis Villarreal is a native of East Los Angeles, which he describes as a neighborhood where collectives (gangs) emerge spontaneously. But his family moved around during his childhood because of his father's professional interests and commitments -- as a musician recording with \"Los Caballeros Trio,\" as a mechanic, and as a tortilla machines salesman. Villarreal says his father also liked to buy, fix-up, and sell the family's house -- one after another -- and that he learned a valuable lesson in flexibility from those years. Science was, of course, an early interest. Two of his life-long passions have been high performance motorcycles and Latin dancing (he says his feet now feel it). Advertisement Aside from Villarreal's current role in the virus center at UC-Irvine, he is a professor of molecular biology and biochemistry at the university. He has developed many science education programs for minority students. Villarreal is also the author of two books: Viruses and the Evolution of Life and Origin of Group Identity . In July 2014, he co-organized a major conference on viruses in Salzburg, Austria -- \" DNA Habitats and RNA Inhabitants \" -- with philosopher of science G\u00fcnther Witzany . Among Luis Villarreal's distinctions are: SACNAS Distinguished Scientist; Distinguished Alumnus Award from California State University, Los Angeles; National Science Foundation Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. He is a Fellow of the American Society of Microbiology and a member of the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans. Advertisement Villarreal's PhD is in biology from the University of California, San Diego -- his mentor was the late John Holland , one of the principal scientists to experimentally evaluate viral quasispecies . Villarreal's BS degree is in biochemistry from California State University, Los Angeles. His postdoc was in virology at Stanford University where he worked with Nobel laureate Paul Berg . Our interview follows. Luis Villarreal : In decades of research and teaching of virology I've heard stories about the 'going away' of viruses, beginning in the 1970s. That was when we eradicated smallpox in the world. The polio vaccine campaign had tremendous strides. Measles, and so forth were on the wane. Many predicted that studying virology would soon be a historic topic. Then HIV made its presence known. Many million human deaths later we accept that viruses don't go away. They just keep coming. This evolutionary reality now has us scrambling. HIV, this little virus of 10,000 nucleotides of RNA, has defeated the combined technologies of the planet since it emerged decades ago, and we still don't have an effective vaccine or way to prevent its transmission. This just demonstrates the massive evolutionary power these entities have. Suzan Mazur : It's clear to me from reading your papers that you have issues with neo-Darwinism. Luis Villarreal : The issues first came up when I began looking at quasispecies in the early 1970s. I was a researcher in the lab of the late John Holland, where there was real enthusiasm for studying evolution theory in the context of actual virus measurements, because the whole concept derived from thinking about RNA viruses. I wasn't interested really in evolutionary theory at a deep level. I was interested in persistence, and for this the Modern Synthesis didn't seem to be working. I just assumed that the theory didn't apply or work in the specific situations we were studying involving persistence, such as VSV, rabies and measles. But the more I got into the research, neo-Darwinism appeared to be working less and less. After I left that area of RNA virus research and began investigating SV40/polyoma virus with Paul Berg at Stanford, that's when it really struck me that a shift in evolutionary thinking was required -- because I realized that these were viruses that make their living by being persistent and stable entities that are essentially part of the host. The theory we had at the time to explain that relationship did not make any sense to me. And that's when I started on my current path. Suzan Mazur : Neo-Darwinism made no sense. Luis Villarreal : Right. In terms of selfish individual types, runaway replicators, and that whole set of related concepts. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : You open your recent New York Academy of Sciences paper on viruses by saying: \"All living habitats (including prebiotic ones) have and must operate in a virosphere (a network of infectious genetic agents)\". That's pretty sweeping. Luis Villarreal : Yes, I stick with that statement. I will argue with anybody on that point. I'd like to define what I mean by a virus, which is a molecular parasite dependent on its host for its maintenance and replication. A virus can also infect another virus, which then becomes its host. Fundamentally, this definition is symbiotic because it has embedded in it dependence on others. Suzan Mazur : You've also noted that \"most experimental paradigms seek to eliminate or have ignored viruses\" and you've advocated that evolutionary science now \"adopt a virus-first perspective.\" Advertisement I want to focus on the science in our interview, but obviously, politics comes into play here. Would you talk about that? Luis Villarreal : Absolutely. That whole issue of politics-- Suzan Mazur : What kind of resistance do you see among evolutionary scientists to accepting a virus-first perspective? Luis Villarreal : There are actually relatively few formally-trained evolutionary scientists who will accept the virus-first perspective. I've encountered a couple. I'm immersed in a population of traditional evolutionary biologists here at Irvine. They just dismiss it. They don't even want to think about it. So it's not a prevailing perspective. But it's one that I think much better explains the foundations of observations, especially now that we have metagenomics informing us about the character of genetic entities -- how lineages and genomes change. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : Scientists don't want to take the time to study it? Luis Villarreal : It's some of that. They very much believe in their theory, and the theory comes first and the observations come second. This is an issue with Manfred Eigen , for example. Eigen has developed a nice theory and career based on this approach. When this happens the science becomes not very available or open to experimental correction. Of course, if it weren't for Manfred Eigen perhaps we wouldn't have pursued the path of viruses the way we did. But Eigen's book published last year, which covers the history of quasispecies thinking, etc., with in-depth mathematical model and evaluations, is completely missing references to a generation and a half of experimental results virologists have accumulated -- many of which are not really terribly consistent with what Eigen is arguing. Esteban Domingo and colleagues in Spain have written a really fantastic review of the last 20 years of virus experimentation. But Eigen doesn't refer to any of it in his book. It's what can happen when a scientist believes their own theory too much. Suzan Mazur : It should be evidence first. Luis Villarreal : Which is the perspective that I adopt. Suzan Mazur : While we're on the subject of politics, I follow you all the way to the end of your New York Academy of Sciences paper \" Force for ancient and recent life: viral and stem-loop RNA consortia promote life \" -- which you call your \"gangen\" paper because of your perspective of viruses as consortia -- until I get to the concluding paragraphs where you make reference to the work of Nilesh Vaidya and Niles Lehman. I interviewed Vaidya at Princeton two years ago about his work on \"recombination events to produce autocatalytic sets,\" as he described it to me, and I ran that interview online. Vaidya has since his 2012 Nature paper on that subject with Niles Lehman redirected his research interests. It is unclear why. Luis Villarreal : I can't actually answer that, but I have suspicions, and they're social in nature. When you make an experimental inference that confronts fundamentally these well-entrenched views - it makes a career very difficult. I got to a position in my career where I was able to extricate myself from a lot of those consequences. Somebody just starting out would be hammered and out of business. Suzan Mazur : Lehman's work had been supported by the late Harry Lonsdale for several years. Lonsdale's reviewers cited lack of results in 2014, one noting: \"[E]ven if apparently recombined sequences are detected, it will be difficult or impossible to trace their genesis.\" And regarding your mention of a so-called \"autocatalytic ribozyme\" in your NYAS paper with reference to Lehman's research - Nobelist Jack Szostak has told me this about autocatalytic sets: Advertisement \"Autocatalytic sets is one of those concepts where the people who came up with the original idea, like Stuart Kauffman, rather than admit being wrong kept changing their story until it was basically the same concept everybody was already working on. The original idea was that there would be large numbers of compounds where one would help another to replicate, and that one could help some other one to replicate, and that somehow out of this huge population of interacting molecules autocatalytic replication would emerge. In my opinion that was never chemically realistic. Now you see people talking about non-enzymatic RNA replication and calling that autocatalytic sets. If that's what you want to call it, that's fine. But it seems like the concept has lost all meaning.\" Luis Villarreal : I've had some conversations with chemists along these lines, which gets into a distinct domain of thinking. They drift into more complicated catalytic outcomes where you just don't have a linear relationship of A to B to C. A to B to C is typically how chemistry is taught. To deny the existence of the nonlinear is not an effective way of thinking about things. Suzan Mazur : Vaidya references Kauffman's concept. Luis Villarreal : That may be, but my point is more fundamental. In order to create a system that has participants that interact and can form an identity as a group, it has to have these characteristics I've described or outlined in the paper that you and I have been discussing, the NYAS \"gangen paper,\" which is consistent with a lot of these attempts to get catalytic RNA to function in a population. Suzan Mazur : So you're saying more traditionally-trained chemists just don't get it, they want to see the molecules. Advertisement Luis Villarreal . Yes, I would say that. In fact, you might want to talk to Vera Kolb at the University of Wisconsin. She's a professor of organic chemist and is interested in origin of life issues and has been active in astrobiology. Vera was trained along traditional lines but thinks in more complex ways with respect to how origin of life occurred. Suzan Mazur : Nick Hud , a Georgia Tech chemist who is trying to find the simplest molecules needed to start life -- a precursor to RNA -- says he's got \"a molecular assembly that is perhaps one bond away from making it a polymer - a covalent polymer.\" Hud told me, \"[There is a long history of people proposing autocatalytic cycles and thinking that such cycles are central to starting life, but then not getting much to work in the lab.\" Luis Villarreal : It' a difficult transition to the nonlinear because it's not how we traditionally do these kind of experiments. The cooperative stem-loop RNA business has had some successes experimentally. Some of those observations I incorporated in the NYAS paper. Suzan Mazur : Corrado Spadafora , who's found evidence of a germline crossing of the Weismann barrier in his experiments, now questions whether a Weismann barrier even exists. He supports your thinking, telling me this: Advertisement \"([E]ndogenous) retroviruses have contributed to shape our genome, are constitutive components of it and are currently playing crucial roles in fundamental processes such as embryogenesis, tumorigenesis and, in the long run, evolution.\" And Franti\u0161ek Balu\u0161ka at the University of Bonn's Institute of Cellular & Molecular Botany has noted : \"Infection, especially the viral one, but also bacterial and fungal infections, followed by symbiosis, is proposed to act as the major force that drives biological evolution toward higher complexity.\" Balu\u0161ka told me viruses \"manipulate adjacent cells to form cell-cell adhesions.\" Animal biologists bristle at the idea of cell-cell adhesion linked to viral infection and viruses, one animal biologist cynically describing them to me as \"intelligent viruses.\" Luis Villarreal : When people use terms like \"intelligent viruses\" -- it is one thing to have a competence, code competence, communication competence that viruses essentially must have in order to function, but if that transitions into a concept of intelligence, that becomes problematic for me. Suzan Mazur : Do viruses have an effect at only the microscale or is their effect apparent at the mesoscale and even macroscale? Advertisement Luis Villarreal : Well, what is the effect of the Ebola outbreak on the human culture and human condition? Ebola is a specific example to think about because the bats have acquired a very unlikely bit of information from Ebola itself, and they did so with the help of another virus, probably an endogenous retrovirus, because it turned that RNA into a DNA and deposited it into the chromosome -- which is what had to have happened. It's not something that a virus can do by itself. It has to have cooperated in a rather complicated way. But my point is that as a consequence, the adaptions that must occur are at all these different levels -- in the context of the immune system, in the context of the culture, in the context of the behavior -- all of this is affected by these events. Suzan Mazur : But in terms of form. Spadafora mentions embryogenesis and you make some reference in a previous paper to the embryo. Luis Villarreal : The systems biologists have immersed themselves in this issue quite a bit because they are characterizing all the transcripts that have occurred in the early stages of development -- 1, 2 cell stages. If you just look at the math, at the amount that is being expressed or transcribed without consigning meaning to it, you see that on a very large scale these parasitic sequences, these endogenous viruses, virons and all of these retroposons are very highly expressed at these points of development and commitment. Some of these are entities that were acquired in a lineage specific way so that you see them in primates or you see them in chimps or you see them in humans. You don't see them necessarily in sister species. So it's clear that some editing events mediated by infectious agents have occurred at the very earliest stages of commitment and differentiation. They are occurring on a significant scale. These are not minor numbers. They're quite abundant. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : So it affects morphology. Luis Villareal : Absolutely, yes. But in ways we are just beginning to tease apart. We don't really understand how, for example, the large mass of non-coding RNAs is doing what it's doing. Suzan Mazur : If your gangen hypothesis is correct, which is that gangs, i.e ., \"RNA collective ensembles coupled with the emergence of endonuclease, ligase, cooperative catalysis, group identity and history markers (RNA) are needed for life to emerge\" -- what happens to the current thinking? Luis Villarreal : It means that sphere of logic is not sufficient to understand this collective. Because if you think about how the collective must operate, in fact, it becomes even a problem of language. You can always trace a linear link between any two participants or any three or four or five participants in a collective. But if it has a conditional character to it. . . If you think of alu retroposon RNA in the human brain and it has a particular activity or function and a particular neuron, and it's doing a specific activity of connecting to some other cell, but then you see in another state, say during learning and memory where it is doing something different and can actually oppose the activity that you saw in the first state -- this means an individual entity has multiple activities. And that's the character of a consortia, which means you now have to start thinking in terms of how the population works and not by just these linear nodes that represent the end reactions. Because they have a conditionality associated with them. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : You've noted that during evolution 3.3 gigabases of DNA, which is the current size of our genome, was once retrovirus, that there are about 330,000 solo long terminal repeats of retroviruses now in human DNA. You've also said these long terminal repeats (LTRs) \"contributed to reregulating about 1,500 genes needed for the placenta to emerge.\" In terms of percentages how much of today's human genome is virus and how are you able to measure this? Luis Villarreal : The definition of what is virus is a little bit fuzzy. The LTRs are clearly identified and categorized so that they themselves don't present too much of a problem as having originated from a viral event. The 330,000 number is one anybody can substantiate by going to the primary sequence and with a recognition algorithm can pull out the LTRs. The problem is the collection of this data goes through a process of masking. This stuff is considered of no interest, or as junk to most people who are doing genomics. The actual collection of the primary data tends to be masked, so you don't even see it. So in order for you to look at this stuff and get a sense of it, you, yourself, have to go directly to the primary sequence data -- which is all this compiled, complicated stuff and apply analyses that can deal with the junk sequence. It's a conundrum just from an experimental perspective. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : Is it possible to say what percentage of the human genome is virus? Luis Villarreal : Depending on how you word that -- for example, in terms of retroviruses and LTRs, the number is about 10%. Suzan Mazur : Same as the percentage of virus in a mouse. Luis Villarreal : But it's a different 10% in a mouse. It doesn't overlap that well with the human 10%. In the mouse you have significantly greater numbers of more intact endogenous retroviruses. So when you breed mice these endogenous retroviruses tend to become active and transmissible. When they first started breeding BalbC mice, within that first year the mice began to develop tumors and die in the breeding colonies. So mice are a little different than humans in that respect. Mice are colonized by viruses that are much closer to being able to make transmissible endogenous viruses. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : In my conversation with Ricardo Flores , he told me that a viroid -like entity is the most likely candidate as the first replicon on Earth, rather than virus because viroids don't need protein but viruses do. He said Theodor Diener who discovered viroids first proposed the idea. Luis Villarreal : Right. Suzan Mazur : Flores also told me that virus and viroid are not related, they have separate evolutions. From your paper, I get the sense that you don't agree. Luis Villarreal : I've had this conversation with him. Carlos Briones, a colleague of Flores, has made the more fundamental argument that it's really the stem-loop structure -- and that's related to my NYAS gangen paper -- that is the functional entity even within a viroid. If look at these stem-loop structures, you see that they're crucial and central to the identity and function of all RNA viruses. And if you look at the simplest of all RNA viruses, it's basically one sequence of these complicated, interacting stem loops. Advertisement Even though I don't disagree for the most part with what Flores said about RNA viruses and viroids having distinct lineages -- it's not absolutely true because we do have an example of the hepatitis situation where you have a viroid that encodes a capsid protein that does behave like a viroid but it also behaves like a virus. So we can see examples of entities that cross those two domains. Suzan Mazur : So you do think that a viroid-like entity is the most likely candidate for the earliest replicon on Earth. But did it arise on Earth or did it come to Earth via comet? What are your thoughts? Luis Villarreal : The viroid-like entity seems more basal. What you're really talking about is an infectious, transmissible nucleic acid that doesn't necessarily encode something. But whether it arose on Earth or came via comet -- at that level I'm not sure you can conclude one way or another whether a seed of our RNA came on a comet because you do see chemistries occur on these comets -- this is something you might want to ask Vera Kolb at the University of Wisconsin -- that might be indicative of that ability to put together precursor molecules to make this consortia. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : You conclude your NYAS paper by saying that the stem-loop RNA consortium became a resident of DNA, it created a stable habitat. When you say stable, you mean there is creative and destructive action going on simultaneously? Luis Villarreal : What I'm asserting is the fundamental importance of the ability of entities to persist not just to replicate. For me persistence is a big deal. The persistence of Ebola in a bat, for instance, is not an accident. It's a deep evolutionary relationship associated with the origin of bats. We often dismiss that by saying: Oh, that's just the reservoir species -- as if that relationship happens willy-nilly all the time. It's a much more fundamental event when an entity figures out how to persist and permanently figures out how to colonize its host. Suzan Mazur : You're saying the persistence has to do with toxic versus antitoxic forces. Luis Villarreal : Yes, but in the case of Ebola, for instance, it is the ability of the virus to kill. That's pretty toxic. But it doesn't kill bats, it kills other populations. That relationship is the one that creates group behavior. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : But the toxic and antitoxic co-exist. Luis Villarreal : They are inseparable. Linear logic fails here. A virus itself will spit out entities that regulate themselves and are subfunctional. They're considered defective, junk by themselves. That's what we see occupying the genomes of eukaryotes -- bits and pieces of regulatory viral chunks like the LTRs. It's also the stuff that seems to be orchestrating, for example, how a placenta works. Suzan Mazur : Do we need a paradigm shift? How do you suggest moving forward in evolutionary science? Luis Villarreal : That's a much more difficult question for me now than you might expect, because it has to do with how we even think and communicate. If living systems work by these processes that are consortial and complex, then our very language and logic is a problem in terms of how we apply it to understand what's going on. I don't have a solution. In a sense our brains are entities adapted to complex thinking. When we think socially, we have this immediate gestalt reaction to a circumstance. All kinds of data are being dealt with, some of it contradictory. We end up with a sense or understanding of what we're experiencing. But in formal thinking and logic, that's not how we operate. We use -- it's a system 1 and a system 2 brain, basically. System 1 behaves by this consortia of information and has both positive and negative, contradictory views that it uses quite comfortably. System 2 behaves linearly and logically. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : It seems European scientists have accepted these ideas more than American scientists. Luis Villarreal : I agree with that. I think the consortia concept is also built socially into the Japanese culture and society, and Japanese scientists may be increasingly interested in the research. Politics is inherent in human behavior because humans have group identity that's based on cognitive input, what we believe. Information we accept. It's built into how our brains function. Negative reactions to a belief basically confront group identity that the person has. Suzan Mazur : Have you had dialogue with scientists synthesizing life in the lab? Luis Villarreal : No. But I do look at their literature and it's apparent they're excluding viruses. Suzan Mazur : Freeman Dyson spoke about parasites and origin of life in my interview with him. Luis Villarrea l: I've read a lot of the earlier stuff that Freeman Dyson wrote. It seems quite congruent with how I think about things. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : It's disappointing if we've got decades of compelling evidence about viruses and evolution, why it's not being responsibly considered by the scientific establishment, particularly in America. Luis Villarreal : These shifts usually take generations. How can evolutionary science not be talking about viruses when genomes are so heavily colonized by these entities? It's because scientists are human beings, and it's an inherent tendency of human cognition to defend what beliefs it has come to accept whether acquired by learning neo-Darwinian thinking or acquired by other social or cultural practices.

CAUGHT ON VIDEO: An Asteroid Or Comet Slammed Into Jupiter As Amateur Astronomers Watched WOW By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Mar 29, 2016, 11:17 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A cosmic collision was caught on video earlier this month when an unknown object slammed into Jupiter while amateur astronomers watched. It's not clear whether the object that hit the planet on March 17 was a comet or asteroid, but a NASA scientist told Space.com it was probably the latter. Advertisement \" It's more likely to be an asteroid simply because there are more of them,\" Paul Chodas, head the agency's Near-Earth Object Program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told the website. Whatever it was, multiple witnesses viewed the collision, including an amateur astronomer based in Ireland who was just hoping to create a great time-lapse video. \"The original purpose of the imaging session was to get this time-lapse, with a happy coincidence of the impact in the second last capture of the night ,\" John McKeon wrote in his video's YouTube description, published on Tuesday. Advertisement The time-lapse was stunning even without the impact: But then McKeon captured something even more unusual: McKeon was one of several skywatchers to witness the impact and record it on video. Gerrit Kernbauer, who was in Austria, didn't realize what he had filmed at first because he didn't watch the video until 10 days later. Advertisement \"I found this strange light spot that appeared for less than one second on the edge of the planetary disc,\" Kernbauer wrote. He magnified the video and slowed it down: \"Thinking back to Shoemaker-Levy 9, my only explanation for this is an asteroid or comet that enters Jupiter's high atmosphere and burned up/explode very fast,\" he wrote. Advertisement Fragments of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet slammed into Jupiter in 1994 as astronomers looked on. In a 2013 blog post, physicist Mark Boslough of Sandia National Laboratories called it \" one of the most spectacular celestial displays ever witnessed .\" Sky and Telescope reported that the latest impact on Jupiter was the fourth of its kind over the last decade . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Stonehenge May Have Been An Ancient 'Mecca On Stilts,' Critic Says Critic Cooks Up 'Totally Different Theory' About Stonehenge By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 16, 2015, 03:33 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Almost a million people a year flock to Stonehenge to marvel at the mysterious prehistoric monument. But what if those massive bluestones were just the foundations of an enormous platform where worshippers came to perform religious ceremonies? That's the intriguing new theory put forth by Julian Spalding , a British art critic and former director of some of the UK\u2019s leading museums, who says the long-lost platform would have made Stonehenge a kind of \" mecca on stilts .\" Advertisement \u201cAll the great raised altars of the past suggest that the people who built Stonehenge would never have performed celestial ceremonies on the lowly earth,\" he told The Guardian, adding that his theory is \"totally different\" from any others put forward before. \"That would have been unimaginably insulting to the immortal beings, for it would have brought them down from heaven to bite the dust and tread in the dung.\u201d Unpacking the theory. Spalding believes a round wooden platform sat atop the monument's stones, which ancient people reached by climbing up a ramp or stairs, as he wrote in his new book Realisation . The platform would have been composed of an outer rim for pilgrims to walk around and an inner one reserved for priests and royalty, he told The Huffington Post in an email. Last September, archaeologists discovered the monument once formed a full circle -- hence the idea for the round platform. Advertisement Previous research suggested that gigantic wooden posts were set up in the area before the stones were erected. As Spalding said in the email, these posts may have been used to help erect the platform and stairway or ramps. Spalding acknowledged that proposing the theory in the absence of physical evidence might be \"a bit cheeky\" . But he emphasized in the email that \"nothing in the archaeological evidence contradicts my interpretation.\" What do archaeologists make of it? Dr. Aubrey Burl , a British archaeologist considered to be an expert on stone circles, told The Guardian that he thought it was worth looking into. Advertisement But others expressed skepticism. As Dr. Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University in England and one of the recent excavators of Stonehenge, told The Huffington Post in an email: \"Some kind of superstructure for Stonehenge has been suggested many times over the last few decades, but all can be questioned on two key points. First, there is absolutely no evidence that the stones supported a timber platform or a roof of any kinds. And second, what exactly would people do up there? The stone structure we see today performs perfectly well in terms of structuring observations of the heavens at the summer and winter solstices and creating spaces for ceremonies and rituals around the use of the Bluestones.\" Stonehenge , located eight miles north of Salisbury in England and believed to have been erected 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, has been listed as a World Heritage Site since 1986.

Science And Technology Combine In Search For Underwater Resting Place Of WWII MIAs \"Families of MIAs never quit -- they never stop missing the person who's been taken out of their lives,\" says BentProp Project founder Patrick Scannon. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost May 31, 2016, 12:19 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scattered debris from a U.S. Navy WWII TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber has been lying on the floor of the Pacific Ocean since 1944. Eric Terrill, Scripps Institution of Oceanography/Mark Moline, Univ. of Delaware The remains of American airmen missing in action since 1944, along with wreckage from their plane, have been located on the ocean floor off the Pacific island republic of Palau. Members of Project RECOVER , a collaborative effort to seek out the final resting places of World War II armed forces personnel, discovered the U.S. Navy TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber in March. However, it took a couple of months to secure the location and collect DNA samples, so they felt it was appropriate to announce the new WWII crash site as Memorial Day weekend approached. Advertisement \"It was a way of saying that we do care, that Memorial Day is an important day. The two just happened to come together and it seemed to make sense to us,\" said Patrick Scannon, founder of the BentProp Project , one of the entities that make up Project RECOVER. Established in 2012, Project RECOVER was co-founded by the BentProp Project, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, and the University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment. Their efforts combine science, technology and archival research to find the remains of MIAs lost among Palau's underwater coral reefs and mangrove forests. Here is newly-released Project RECOVER video showing the Avenger's final resting place on the ocean floor, 80 feet below the surface of the water. Advertisement Pictured below is a typical three-person crew TBM-1C Avenger aircraft that saw combat during WWII. A TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber. National Archives Project RECOVER aims to locate as many MIAs as possible so that the U.S. government may bring them home for a proper burial. Advertisement \"This recovery is another step closer towards Project RECOVER's goal of finding the final underwater resting places of all Americans missing in action since World War II,\" stated Dan Friedkin , who is chairman of the Air Force Heritage Flight Foundation and provides financial backing for Project RECOVER. \"Every family member impacted by the loss of a service member deserves this type of closure.\" The primary search region for missing-in-action American aircraft and their crews centers around Palau, located in the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines and north of New Guinea. Scripps Institution of Oceanography estimates that there are several dozen U.S. aircraft and the remains of some 80 American MIAs in the area. Google Maps Advertisement The BentProp Project has focused on this endeavor for 20 years, conducting historical and archival research to support yearly month-long searches. \"We've always limited ourselves to one area -- the republic of Palau, but that's only because there's a lot of missing aircraft there,\" physician and BentProp founder Scannon told The Huffington Post. \"When we were thinking of a name, the first thing that came to my mind was that I always see bent propellers at these crash sites. We decided that it captured the tragedy and it just stuck.\" The people involved with the BentProp Project have individual backgrounds and skills in areas crossing over aviation, archaeology, history, navigation, photography and anthropology -- all necessary ingredients to look for and find these crash sites. Advertisement Partnering with UCSD and the University of Delaware in 2012 has made even more discoveries possible. \"Since we started jointly working together, we found a total of six aircraft underwater ... and we have up to 10 MIA associated with the crashes,\" Scripps oceanographer Eric Terrill told HuffPost. \"Five of those are U.S. aircraft, one was a Japanese airplane, and several of those aircraft have MIAs associated with them.\" \u201cSince we started jointly working together, we found a total of six aircraft underwater ... and we have up to 10 MIA associated with the crashes.\u201d - Eric Terrill, Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UCSD \"Many times, targets are very apparent in the sonar imagery, and others take a while to analyze the data to find the manmade objects,\" Terrill said. \"Sonar doesn't give us a clear-cut picture, especially a lot of these wrecks that don't necessarily look like an airplane once they've broken up, as the wings get torn off and the engines get pulled off.\" Advertisement Yet even after 70 years, Terrill says, seawater helps preserve the remains of those lost in action. \"Between DNA techniques, dental records and dog tags, there's a number of different forensic tools that the U.S. government has at their fingertips ... to do the identification process,\" he explained. Pending final DNA identification of the missing Avenger crew members, the families will be notified. \"One only has to be with a family, once the remains are returned, to understand how important this is,\" Scannon said. \"My initial thought was, 'would the families even care?' But once I started meeting them, I realized very quickly that families of MIAs never quit -- they never stop missing the person who's been taken out of their lives. Even more surprising is that second and third generation family members often have stronger feelings because they never met the person.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scannon described what it's like when he's underwater and discovers a crash site for the first time. \"It is an arresting moment...almost like a knee jerk. I pull up and look at it and realize that we haven't found just a historically interesting site, but we've found the temporary tomb of Americans who've been missing in action for a long, long time. It is a privilege to be there and a privilege to finally study and know what happened so that the families can understand the fate of their loved ones. \"A whole bunch of different emotions crowd in all at once. My pulse goes up, I'm probably breathing faster than I should and just try to take in the moment. The thing that somehow seals it for me is I try to find one part of the plane that is as close as I can get to where the crew was and I touch that, and that moment of touching, to me, somehow seals the reality -- that I'm not just looking at it, that it's real. I think it affects all of us that way.\" \"Certainly, it's a national responsibility to find and recover remains from our past wars,\" added Terrill. \"It's a great teaching moment to remind the American public about a lot of the sacrifices family members have made. For me, personally, it's been very humbling to take some of my trade craft from ocean science and ocean technology and apply it to this type of problem.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Mars Rover Can Celebrate 'Birthday' By Singing Alone On The Desolate Planet The Curiosity rover has given NASA plenty to celebrate. By Sebastian Murdock Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 5, 2017, 03:06 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The sad robot takes a selfie. NASA NASA / Reuters If you\u2019ve ever spent a birthday alone quietly singing to yourself, congratulations, you have more in common with the Mars rover than you may have thought! Saturday marks five years since NASA\u2019s Curiosity rover landed on Mars to begin its mission of conducting research into the Red Planet . And while it\u2019s technically an anniversary, the engineers at the space agency programmed their cute little robot to sing the \u201c Happy Birthday \u201d song. Advertisement And the results are, uh... a little depressing. The reports of my singing are greatly exaggerated. I only hummed \"Happy Birthday\" to myself once, back in 2013. \ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udfb5 https://t.co/wK3HGP2STY pic.twitter.com/o4b3AuVm1c \u2014 Curiosity Rover (@MarsCuriosity) August 4, 2017 NASA said that the rover has actually only hummed the song once before on its birthday in 2013, which is somehow even more sad. Despite being all alone, Curiosity has a great deal to celebrate. Thanks to the rover, we\u2019ve gotten some magnificent photos of Mars never seen before. The NASA rover has also found methane and organic chemicals on the planet \u2015 which could indicate that there was once life on Mars. Advertisement This NASA image taken by the Mast Camera (MastCam) on its Curiosity rover in 2012 highlights the geology of Mount Sharp, a mountain inside Gale Crater, where the rover landed.

This Tiny, Beating Heart Was Made From Stem Cells Thump. Thump. Thump. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 17, 2015, 04:40 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT They're only half a millimeter in diameter -- about a third the length of a pinhead -- but they're there, thumping away. Tiny, beating almost-hearts. Scientists have grown the miniature organs, one of which you can see below, from human stem cells derived from skin tissue, and they're the first human heart chamber ever developed in vitro. The findings could someday help researchers determine how medications affect the hearts of developing fetuses, according to a study published in the journal Nature Communications. NewScientist Advertisement The tiny \"heart\" is actually a cardiac microchamber, which is basically a functional model of a human ventricle, that researchers hope will someday be used \"to model aspects of early developing heart[s],\" the paper reads. Stem cells were placed in a petri dish to grow, but were \"coaxed\" with oxygen plasma so they would turn into cardiac tissue, Popular Science notes . Twenty days later, the cells had developed into beating little models of a human organ. The research is notable because it would allow scientists to use humanlike hearts in medical research rather than the rodent hearts currently used. \u201cWe believe it is the first example illustrating the process of a developing human heart chamber in vitro,\u201d Kevin Healy, a professor at University of California, Berkeley and co-author of the study, said in a press release . \u201cThis technology could help us quickly screen for drugs likely to generate cardiac birth defects, and guide decisions about which drugs are dangerous during pregnancy.\u201d Advertisement To test the efficacy of future trials, the researchers also grew some of the microchambers with an added drug called thalidomide in levels that would mimic the exposure a fetus gets during pregnancy. Thalidomide, which used to be prescribed to treat morning sickness, has been linked to birth defects , including abnormalities of the heart, the BBC notes. The cardiac tissue exposed to the drug \"significantly damaged the cardiac microchambers, generating chambers with smaller size, lower contractility and beat rates compared with controls.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Weird Little 'Walking' Cavefish Is A Living Link To A Key Moment In Evolution Cryptotora thamicola may help show how life first stepped out of the oceans. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Mar 29, 2016, 03:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING It may not seem like much -- a little blind cavefish squirming its way up a rock -- but researchers say this is one of the most unique fish on the planet. \"What these fish do in complete darkness is they stick to the rock and they climb waterfalls completely underwater ,\" Daphne Soares, an assistant professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, said in a video news release. Advertisement The fish, found in Thailand, is called Cryptotora thamicola, and the way it can walk and climb is unlike any other known fish. In fact, it moves almost like a salamander , Soares and her fellow researchers wrote in the journal Nature Scientific Reports. They believe this fish may be a living link to a key moment in evolution, when finned creatures of the sea became the limbed creatures of the land. While there are other fish that can appear to walk, they use their fins and generally rely on the flow of water around them to keep upright. Advertisement But, according to the new research, this cavefish is able to support its own bodyweight against gravity using its pelvis and vertebral column.

Indian rhinos are listed as \"vulnerable\" and there are only around 2,000-3,000 left in the wild . Advertisement Welcome to the world little one.  Our Indian rhino Ashakiran gave birth to a male calf on 02/17. The calf appears to be healthy and feeding well, but the first 30 days are critical and staff will continue to monitor them both closely. #TORhinoBaby #TObabyboom #savingspecies A photo posted by Toronto Zoo (@thetorontozoo) on Feb 19, 2016 at 4:06am PST \"The calf appears to be healthy and feeding well,\" the zoo said in a post on Instagram. \"But the first 30 days are critical and staff will continue to monitor them both closely.\" The Toronto Sun reports that this is Ashakiran's first surviving calf , as she has previously had trouble maintaining pregnancy and gave birth to a stillborn in 2011. Advertisement To maintain this pregnancy, she was given oral progesterone through a partnership with Cincinnati Zoo .

A colossal dark hole was recently spotted on the sun's surface , and it has been spewing solar wind our way. According to NASA, the high-speed wind triggered a light show of several auroras on Earth last week. A photo of the \"coronal hole\" (below) was taken by a camera aboard the space agency's Solar Dynamics Observatory on Oct. 10. The dark area across the top of the sun in this image is a coronal hole. High-speed solar wind originating from the hole created a geomagnetic storm near Earth that resulted in several nights of auroras. NASA/SDO Advertisement The hole is located on the outermost layer of the sun , called the corona, in the northern hemisphere. It is about the size of 50 Earths and is releasing wind at up to 500 miles per second, Space.com reported. A geomagnetic storm watch was issued for Wednesday through Friday, as forecasters continued to monitor the solar particle-carrying wind heading our way. Coronal holes are often the source of faster-than-normal solar winds since they mark cooler regions on the sun. These regions have a lower density of solar material and weakened magnetic field lines -- factors that make it easier for solar wind to escape. Advertisement When solar wind reaches Earth, it can disturb our planet's magnetosphere and cause geomagnetic storms . While such storms create beautiful auroras, or Northern Lights, they can also affect satellite and radio communication systems. NASA scientists haven't indicated whether the recently spotted hole will stick around for Halloween, but coronal holes are known to last for up to months . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

When past studies have looked at the effect of emotions on physical health, it has tended to focus on the deleterious effect of negative emotions like anger and mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Here are five positive emotions that have been shown to improve physical health and prevent disease. Optimism may protect the heart. While we usually define optimism as a sunny outlook towards the future, it also encompasses much more than that. The hopeful emotion acts as a coping mechanism that can help individuals to prevail through life's challenges by maintaining a conviction that things will work out in life. Advertisement A growing body of research has suggested that cultivating this quality can have a protective effect on the heart. According to a 2012 review of literature , a number of studies have shown that people with optimistic personalities are at a reduced risk of cardiovascular events. More recently, a fascinating study found that language used on Twitter could predict mortality from heart disease -- specifically, language related to optimism and resiliency (\"overcome,\" \"stronger,\" \"faith\") was associated with a lower risk of mortality within a particular community. Optimism's benefits for physical health also extend beyond heart health. Here are a few other ways that a sunny disposition may improve health outcomes, including improved immune system function and increased longevity. Experiencing awe reduces inflammatory markers associated with autoimmune disease. Hiking through a beautiful natural landscape, listening to moving classical music, or participating in a religious or spiritual ritual are some of the experiences in life that make us feel most joyful and alive. Research has shown that experiences of art, religion and philosophy are the most common experiences that evoke a sense of awe -- that sense of wonder and connection to something larger than ourselves. Advertisement According to new research from the University of California at Berkeley , awe is not only pleasurable but also enormously beneficial for one's physical and mental health. The Berkeley study found that those who had recently experienced awe had lower levels of cytokines, inflammatory markers that, in chronically high levels, have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, as well as other health problems including including heart disease, Alzheimer's and depression. This suggests that awe promotes healthier levels of cytokines and may prevent disease. \"Rather than seeing a walk through the park or a trip to the museum as an indulgence, we hope people will view these kind of experiences as important ways to promote a healthy body in addition to a healthy mind,\" one of the study's authors, Dr. Jennifer Stellar, told the Huffington Post . \"Folding these kinds of positive experiences into your daily routine may be more important for health than we previously realized. Compassion and care for others can improve vagus nerve function. Compassion -- a loving concern for the well-being of others -- can make us feel positively towards both ourselves and other people, and may improve our physical health in at least one important way. Advertisement Positive psychologist Barbara Frederickson has conducted research on the effects of lovingkindness meditation (LKM), a traditional Buddhist practice that involves meditating on love and extending compassion to oneself and a progressively large group of others. Frederickson found just six weeks of LKM training to have a positive impact on the vagus nerve, which extends from the brain stem to the heart, helping to regulate emotions as well as bodily systems including the cardiovascular and digestive systems. In boosting feelings of compassion, the meditation led to improvements in resting vagal tone (which can be used to assess the degree of activity in the automatic nervous system). In an interview with Emory University , Frederickson explained that the vagus nerve plays an important role in both a person's physical health and their feeling of love and connection to others. \u201cIn a way, our bodies are designed for love, because the more we love, the more healthy we become,\u201d she said. Advertisement Gratitude may also benefit heart health and immune system function. Like optimism, an \"attitude of gratitude\" -- an appreciation and feeling of thankfulness for the blessings one has in life -- carries significant mental and physical health benefits. Gratefulness, like optimism, has been linked with improved immune health , and has also been shown to improve sleep quality . Gratitude may also improve health and well-being in a variety of ways insofar as it lowers stress levels -- stress being one of the main contributing factors to many chronic diseases. Research has shown that among older adults, feeling a sense of gratitude towards God acts as a buffer against the negative health effects of stress. Self-compassion improves health-related behaviors. People who cultivate kindness towards themselves are also kinder to their bodies, potentially helping them to prevent or manage a range of negative physical and mental health outcomes. Advertisement A 2013 study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin examined the relationship between self-compassion, reactions to illness, and a range of health-related behaviors, finding that self-compassionate people sought medical attention sooner for symptoms that they were experiencing than people who were lacking in self-compassion. Self-compassionate people also tended to be less depressed about health problems they were experiencing, and also to take a more proactive approach towards their own health. \"It is fine to experience the pain of a negative event,\" cognitive scientist Dr. Art Markman wrote in Psychology Today . \"But, after acknowledging the pain, it is also important to get up and try again -- to remember that failures and illnesses and bad relationships are not a verdict on your worth as a person, but just another hurdle to be overcome.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Mysterious Yellowstone Geyser Eruptions Stump Scientists Steamboat blows but that doesn't mean Yellowstone's supervolcano is going to spew, experts say. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Apr 30, 2018, 03:02 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING The world\u2019s largest active geyser has erupted three times in the past six weeks and scientists don\u2019t know why. The latest event, which was photographed by a visitor to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, occurred on Friday. Advertisement The last time there was a major eruption of the Steamboat Geyser was in 2014. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, all of this year\u2019s eruptions have been smaller than the 2014 event. Although scientists can\u2019t explain why the geyser has become so active, they don\u2019t believe the eruptions in the northwest section of the park signal pending trouble with the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone . Advertisement \u201cThere is nothing to indicate that any sort of volcanic eruption is imminent ,\u201d Michael Poland, head of the USGS\u2019s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told Reuters.

The park is on top of a volcanic caldera \u2014 or crater \u2014 and vast underground chambers of magma flow miles beneath the surface. Geysers erupt when magma heats water that has seeped underground. The park\u2019s most famous geyser, Old Faithful, is a fraction of the size of Steamboat and erupts every 45 to 125 minutes. 6:26 PM \u00b110 minutes is the next predicted eruption of Old Faithful Geyser. For other geyser predictions, dial 307-344-2751, option 2. \u2014 GeyserNPS (@GeyserNPS) April 29, 2018 Advertisement As for the Steamboat Geyser, Poland told The Washington Post: \u201c It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s exciting , it\u2019s neat.

Curiosity Captures 360-Degree Panorama From Martian Dune The Mars rover is currently exploring the red planet's active Bagnold Dunes. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 6, 2016, 12:26 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Everyone\u2019s favorite Martian explorer, NASA\u2019s intrepid Curiosity rover, has been getting up close and personal with the red planet\u2019s stunning sand dunes . On Tuesday, striking images snapped from the top of a particularly imposing dune were released by NASA. When combined, the photos provide a 360-degree view from the 16-foot-high \u201cNamib Dune.\u201d Advertisement This view of the downwind face of \"Namib Dune\" on Mars covers 360 degrees, including a portion of Mount Sharp on the horizon. The component images of this scene were taken on Dec. 18, 2015, by the Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover during the 1,197th Martian day of its work on Mars. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS NASA says it\u2019s using Curiosity\u2019s data to better understand Mars\u2019 dunes -- particularly how \u201cwind moves and sorts grains of sand in an environment with less gravity and much less atmosphere\u201d than Earth. The rover is currently examining the Bagnold Dunes, an active band of dunes located on the northwestern flank of Mount Sharp. According to NASA, some of the Bagnold Dunes are migrating by as much as a yard per Earth year.

Become A Craft Beer Expert In Three Minutes. Here's To Chemistry! Become A Craft Beer Expert In Three Minutes. Here's To Chemistry! By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Mar 16, 2015, 12:58 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT You don't have to know any chemistry to enjoy beer, but it's nice to have a few facts on tap--especially if you find yourself in a game of one-upmanship with some hopped-up craft brew know-it-all. And you can get all the basic facts about the molecular basis of beer in a fun new video just posted by the American Chemical Society as part of its Reactions series . Advertisement Wort! Malt! Hops and humulone ! It's all here. Cheers! Before You Go Pilsner Radeberger Pilsner is one of the youngest beer styles in the world; it's a clean and simple pale lager and one of the more popular beer varieties. It was originally brewed in Plzen, Czechoslovakia in 1842 using the regions distinctive Noble Saaz hops. Flavor Profile: Strong hops, softer malt, fragrant, and pleasurably bitter flavors. Recommended Pilsners: Radeberger Pilsner Urquell Warsteiner Wheat Beer Hoegaarden Wheat beer is reminiscent of the first brewed beers. They're a mixture of barley and wheat grains, have a low to nonexistent hops presence, cloudy appearance, and often prominent yeast flavor. The yeast used is a specialized ale yeast used only in wheat beers and contributes much of the aroma and flavor of the brew. Flavor Profile: The flavor ranges greatly depending on wheat styles, but they're typically light in flavor, making them great summer beers. Recommended Wheat Beers: Hoegaarden Allagash White Harpoon's UFO Hefeweizen Brown Ale New Castle True to its name, brown ale is a dark amber color. It's a very old style beer, whose history dates back to unhopped ales. In the 18th century, brown ales were lightly hopped and brewed from 100 percent brown malt -- which is how they got their distinctive color, but today the term brown ale incorporates many different kinds of brews. Flavor Profile: Brown ales have a higher level of malt, which makes it more earthy and less bitter. Flavors vary from sweet, to slightly hoppy, to earthy and malty. Recommended Brown Ales: New Castle Brown Ale Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale Advertisement Pale Ale Anchor Brewing Company Pale ale is one of the world's most popular beer styles. It was invented thanks to innovation in brewing technology where they discovered a method to gently roast the barley. It's made with the use of pale malt. Flavor Profile: In the UK, this brew has a strong malty and woody flavor. In the U.S., the hops are ramped up during brewing, making it a spicy beer. Recommended Pale Ales: Anchor Brewing Company Liberty Ale Sierra Nevada pale ale Duvel India Pale Ale (IPA) During the 1700s, when English troops lived in India the typical pale ale brew most Englishmen drank would spoil before the ship reached the Indian shores. In order to prolong the beers shelf life, brewers added more hops (a natural preservative), and hence the origin of a now very popular beer. Flavor Profile: A strong hoppy flavor, with a slightly bitter taste. Recommended IPAs: Brooklyn East India IPA Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA Double IPAs Flying Dog Ales Double IPAs are also called \"Imperial\" IPAs. These beers have even more hops added to them than traditional IPAs, sometimes double to triple the amount. To balance the strong hoppy taste, more malt is also added which makes this beer a strong one. Flavor Profile: Due to its doubling up on hops and malts, this brew has strong, fruity, hoppy notes and deep malty undertones. Recommended Double IPAs: Lagunita Maximus Double Dog Double Pale Ale Advertisement Bock Anchor Brewing Company Bock beer is stronger than your typical lager and has a more robust malt character. In the Medieval days, German monasteries would brew strong beers, such as this one, for sustenance during their Lenten fasts. Flavor Profile: Rich and malty with a slight hint of hops bitterness. Recommended Bocks: Michelob Amber Bock Anchor Bock Beer Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock Porter Stone Brewing Co. Porters are very dark, almost opaque. They consist of roasted malts or roasted barley, and are typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. Flavor Profile: Mild with notes of roasted grains, chocolate and toffee and none of the harsh notes of stout. Recommended Porter: Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter Alaskan Smoked Porter Smoked Porter Stout Samuel Smith Stouts have an unclear history, yet it's strongly held by many that they derive from porters. They're made with black unmalted barley which contributes to most of the color and flavor characteristics common in all stouts. The head of stout should be thick and is usually tan to brown. Flavor Profile: Heavily roasted flavor. Should have hints of coffee, chocolate, licorice, and molasses with no apparent hops flavor. Recommended Stouts: Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout Pike Stout Extra Stout Advertisement WATCH: The Right Way To Pour Beer The right way to pour a beer (regular beer and Guinness).

Stephen Hawking Finished Mind-Bending Parallel Universe Paper Days Before His Death The new treatise on the existence of parallel universes was published on Friday. By Carol Kuruvilla Religion Reporter, HuffPost May 2, 2018, 05:23 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Professor Stephen Hawking addressing The Cambridge Union on Nov. 21, 2017 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. Chris Williamson via Getty Images British physicist Stephen Hawking may have died in March, but his legacy is still unfolding. The prominent theoretical physicist and cosmologist co-authored a research paper about the existence of parallel universes similar to our own, which the Journal of High-Energy Physics posthumously published on Friday. According to the BBC, the study was submitted to the open-access journal shortly before Hawking\u2019s death. Advertisement Thomas Hertog, a co-author of the study, told the BBC that he and Hawking were wrestling with the idea that the Big Bang actually resulted in the creation of multiple \u201cpocket universes\u201d that exist throughout space. It was unclear to them whether the laws of physics that apply in our universe would also apply in these alternate universes. \u201cIn the old theory there were all sorts of universes: some were empty, others were full of matter, some expanded too fast, others were too short-lived. There was huge variation,\u201d said Hertog , a physics professor at the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. \u201cThe mystery was why do we live in this special universe where everything is nicely balanced in order for complexity and life to emerge?\u201d Hertog and Hawking\u2019s paper uses new mathematical techniques to restore order to previously chaotic views of the multiverse, suggesting that these different universes are subject to the same laws of physics as our own. Advertisement Pallbearers carry the coffin out of Great St Marys Church at the end of the funeral of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, in Cambridge, Britain, March 31, 2018. Henry Nicholls / Reuters \u201cIt reduces the multiverse down to a more manageable set of universes which all look alike,\u201d said Hertog, whose paper with Hawkings drew on 20 years of work. The physicists also gave other researchers a pathway to potentially detect the presence of other universes by searching for cosmic microwave radiation that is left over from the Big Bang. Advertisement Hertog said that communication became more difficult near the end of Hawking\u2019s life \u2015 although the physicist apparently never showed signs of wanting to quit. Along with his recently published study, Hawking has at least two other papers that are being prepared for publication, according to the Guardian. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Hawking died at the age of 76 on March 14, due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. He rose to global fame in 1988, after publishing a general audience book on science, A Brief History of Time . In the world of astrophysics, he\u2019s best known for his theories on black holes.

Venus Rises Behind The Aurora In Stunning Time-Lapse Filmed From Space Thank you, Tim Peake! By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost May 30, 2016, 11:36 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Tim Peake's time in space is coming to an end. But it looks as if the British astronaut is making the most of the three weeks he has left on board the International Space Station . Peake shared this stunning time-lapse video of Venus rising behind one of the auroras to Facebook on Sunday, and the clip is now going viral: Advertisement Peake didn't reveal which part of Earth the ISS was flying over when he captured the spectacular sight. Therefore, it's unclear whether he filmed the Aurora Borealis or the Aurora Australis , also known respectively as the Northern and Southern Lights. Nicknamed with regard to their proximity to the North and South Poles, the lights take place \" when electrically charged protons and electrons in the Earth's magnetic field collide with neutral atoms in the upper atmosphere,\" says NASA. View post on imgur.com Advertisement The spaceman said he shot an image every second for around two and a half minutes to create the mesmerizing time-lapse video of the second planet from the Sun rising into view. Peake also revealed what camera he's been using to snap away during his six-month stint on the station: 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Resurrecting Ancient Wines That Can Survive Climate Change In the case of Bodegas Torres\u2019 ancestral-wine project, that means producing varieties that both taste great and can thrive in hotter temperatures.

LEAVE A COMMENT By Matthew Sedacca The Spanish region of Catalonia is proud of its traditions. The official language, Catalan, has thrived for centuries, despite the establishment of Spanish as the rest of the country\u2019s official language in the 1700s. Castells , or adults and children climbing on each other\u2019s shoulders to form human towers, continues to be a popular activity at festivals. And in Vilafranca del Pened\u00e8s, an hour outside of Barcelona, the local winery Bodegas Torres is researching and rediscovering wine varieties long thought to be extinct. It just so happens that many of these revived regional varieties thrive in hotter, drier climates. So Bodegas Torres is regrowing these ancestral vines to assuage the wine industry\u2019s looming climate-change crisis. Advertisement \u201cBodegas Torres is regrowing these ancestral vines to assuage the wine industry\u2019s looming climate-change crisis.\u201d Growers in Mediterranean-climate regions in Western Europe, California and Australia report that increasing temperatures are leading to early harvests. For the time being, these early harvests result in higher-quality wines. But as temperatures climb higher and higher, driven by human-related greenhouse gas emissions, researchers believe that climates throughout these regions will become unsuitable for growing popular varieties. A 2013 study reported that lands suitable for growing wine grapes will decline by 25 percent (Chile) to 73 percent (Australia) by 2050. In 2016, a paper analyzing viticulture data in France and Switzerland from 1600 to 2007 found that climate change is indeed behind the higher temperatures driving the reported early harvests across Western Europe. RELATED: Climate Change Is About to Change Your Wine Benjamin Cook, the 2016 paper\u2019s lead author, explains that although early harvests may be a boon for growers in some areas, the increased heat will have different effects on wine-grape production in wetter climates like France, compared to drier regions like California or Spain. \u201cIn California, it doesn\u2019t rain from May to September, so if you don\u2019t have the water stored in the ground, or water available from reservoir to irrigate, that can have a negative impact on grape production,\u201d Cook says. He added that in addition to California, \u201careas that already have dry summers \u2014 the Mediterranean climates \u2014 those are the areas where the adaptation for drought is going to be very important.\u201d Advertisement Grapes in the Bodegas Torres vineyard (Andrea Marks) Despite Spanish winemakers\u2019 imminent need for a solution to these increasing temperatures, Bodegas Torres\u2019 ancestral-wine project was actually motivated by a desire to preserve local heritage. \u201cAll this research that we are doing by the ancient Catalan varieties, it\u2019s something we are doing for the land, for the history of Catalonia,\u201d Mireia Torres Maczassek, the winery\u2019s director of research and development, said. Climate adaptability, it turns out, is a happy side-effect. During the 19th century, many vineyards in Western European countries like France and Spain suffered from phylloxera, a microscopic aphid that attacks the grapevines\u2019 roots and causes rot. The Pened\u00e8s region lost many red wine varieties to the scare, and afterwards, wineries planted white varieties that had been grafted with phylloxera-resistant American rootstock. But decades later, the local winemaker Miguel A. Torres believed that the Pened\u00e8s region might still host a few survivors of the pest eradication. During the 1980s, Torres posted ads in local newspapers, asking farmers to respond if they spotted any unidentified or unusual vines in their fields. By 1996, Bodegas Torres, with Miguel A. Torres as its president, produced its first healthy ancestral grape species: Garr\u00f3 , a tannin-heavy, dark blue grape. Advertisement RELATED: In the Future, Your Champagne Will Come From England Now, almost 30 years later, this viticulture-flecked archaeological research project has led to an environmental research collaboration with France\u2019s National Agricultural Research Institute, as well as the rediscovery of 46 grape varieties (although only a few are capable of producing wine). Inside the winery\u2019s experimental greenhouse, rows of bright green vines stretch toward the sun, awaiting their replanting in micro-test fields. Torres Maczassek explains that the process of identifying and reviving a wine variety is a tedious one. After conducting identification and DNA analyses to determine whether the supposedly unknown vine already \u201cexists,\u201d they extract tissue from the tip of the ancestral plant\u2019s shoot. The tissue is then grown in vitro for a year, and afterwards grown in a soilless mineral solution to gain more biomass. The healthy vines are then planted in experimental vineyards in different nearby climates, and finally, their berries are used to create wine. Advertisement The Torres vineyard in Catalonia (Andrea Marks) Some of these varieties thrived extremely well in the arid testing environments, due to characteristics like their berries ripening near the end of autumn, and to water-retention mechanisms like restricting or slowing leaf growth. A century from now, when hotter weather has made some of the grape varieties used today obsolete in Catalonia and other regions, these ancestral vines will be more capable of bearing fruit. RELATED: Alcohol: Climate Change\u2019s Next Victim? Even if the future\u2019s higher temperatures are anthropically induced, Markus Rienth, a professor of viticulture at Changins, a school in Switzerland with a focus on viticulture and oenology, says that the reason the varieties rediscovered by Bodegas Torres are better suited for hotter global temperatures is that numerous regions have gone through their own climate changes in the past. \u201cWe had this Climatic Optimum during the Middle Ages, and temperatures were pretty similar to now. Then it cooled down, and now it\u2019s heating up again,\u201d Rienth said. \u201cThat could be a reason those varieties perform better now.\u201d Advertisement Elizabeth Wolkovich, an ecologist at Harvard University and co-author on the 2016 study, says these ancestral varieties alone don\u2019t carry the burden of keeping the world supplied with wine during a hotter future. In a review published this past June, she and her co-authors wrote that although the amount of genetic diversity among well-known and commonly used wine varieties is extremely small, differences in their seasonal development are vast. Wineries, she hypothesized, could crossbreed to produce super-climate offspring. In the case of Bodegas Torres\u2019 ancestral-wine project, that means producing varieties that both taste great and can thrive in hotter temperatures. Despite the predictions of higher global temperatures in the near future, speed unfortunately is not something Torres Maczassek and her colleagues can promise. Even after regrowing a healthy variety, it can take nearly 20 years for the Spanish and Catalan governments to officially recognize these living dinosaurs and green-light them for mass production. But if their plan works, we\u2019ll at least have decent reds and whites to sip on \u2014 perhaps at a time we need them most. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In Katrina's Aftermath, Psychologists Find Trauma As Well As Resilience \"Natural disasters and other traumatic events could be engines of growth.\" By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 26, 2015, 10:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Mario Tama/Getty Images Ten years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, forcing more than half a million residents to flee, psychologists are investigating the mental and emotional fallout of the natural disaster. A series of longitudinal studies of Katrina survivors , featured this week in the journal Nature, paint a complicated picture of the storm's repercussions for mental health. Advertisement The studies, which were conducted as part of the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina Project, showed that many Katrina survivors experienced mental health issues related to the disaster. But researchers were surprised to observe that a number of survivors also showed remarkable resilience, and even growth, in the wake of trauma. \"The possibility of positive change was so far from our radar screens that not a single question about improvement was included in our first round of post-disaster [data] collection,\" Dr. Jean Rhodes, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston and one of the RISK project's principal investigators, told The Huffington Post. \"Yet our data revealed that natural disasters and other traumatic events could be engines of growth, resulting in a kind of spiritual awakening.\" Rhodes noted that this growth didn't come easily: A high percentage of survivors struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health conditions before going on to experience what is known as post-traumatic growth. Others experienced mental illness related to the disaster that ultimately did not lead to resilience or growth. Advertisement The RISK Project , created by Rhodes and a team of psychologists from around the country, came about in an unexpected way. In 2003, the team began collecting data on more than 1,000 low-income parents in New Orleans, to study whether receiving community college scholarships would improve the parents' well-being. Interrupted when Katrina hit in 2005, the researchers got a rare opportunity to use the data they had already collected -- which included information on economic status, social connections, and physical and mental health -- to track the participants' health after the storm and compare it to their pre-storm baseline. Since the hurricane, the team has conducted follow-up studies to determine the effects of the trauma on the participants' physical, mental and social well-being. Advertisement They found that nearly half of the 392 men and women who took part in the follow-up showed symptoms of PTSD one year after Katrina, while 14 percent suffered from other serious mental illnesses such as depression and psychosis -- double the rate at which they suffered from these conditions before the storm hit. Other research has corroborated these findings, including one study of storm-affected areas showing that mental illnesses like PTSD and depression tended to get worse following the disaster. That study showed that the percentage of people experiencing suicidal thoughts several months after Katrina had more than doubled by one year after the storm, while rates of PTSD rose from 15 percent to 21 percent in that time period. What were the most psychologically devastating aspects of the disaster? Threats to one's own physical well-being and the well-being of others were the factors most highly correlated with PTSD and general psychological distress, as well as lack of basic survival needs -- such as food, water and medical care -- and loss of a pet. Advertisement However, one study using RISK data, which focused on low-income, unmarried African-American women who survived the storm, found that nearly half of participants could be considered resilient, meaning they experienced an increase in psychological distress after the disaster, but returned to pre-disaster distress levels within three years. What's more, roughly 30 percent of survivors experienced post-traumatic growth, meaning they felt the experience in some way made them stronger . This growth took the form of improved relationships, greater empathy and compassion, enhanced spirituality, an improved sense of personal strength and the ability to envision new possibilities in life. Those who had strong support from their families, friends and communities were most likely to show resilience and growth, according to Joy Osofsky, a Louisiana State University psychologist who set up mental health care facilities in New Orleans during the storm's aftermath. Advertisement \"With support from friends, services providers, mental health support ... we saw a great deal of post-traumatic growth,\" said Osofsky, who was not involved in the RISK project but has conducted research on psychological well-being in Katrina survivors . \"People would share that going through Katrina was devastating; however, they felt they had also learned a lot and because of that experience would be better able to cope with other adversities in their lives.\" It's not just individuals who showed remarkable growth in the wake of extreme loss. As several disasters (most recently the Charleston, South Carolina, shooting ) have shown, entire communities also are capable of rallying together and rebuilding themselves. \"Communities that have been damaged and even destroyed by a large disaster can learn from it and come out stronger,\" Rhodes said. \"With planning and a post-traumatic growth mindset, societies can harness the shock and loss of a disaster, and use it to fundamentally change for the better.\" Advertisement The RISK project's findings may help psychologists and public health workers identify factors that lead to an increased risk of psychological trauma, and to better treat disaster-related mental illness in the future. Rhodes added that post-traumatic growth on a societal level is not only possible but also potentially \"necessary in the coming years as we face the mounting threat of catastrophic loss from climate change.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Will The New Horizons Mission Give Pluto A Second Chance At Planethood? Will The New Horizons Mission Give Pluto A Second Chance At Planethood? By Jared Greenhouse Post-Production, HuffPost Live Jul 15, 2015, 09:14 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Is Pluto a planet? It's a simple question, but one scientists and space buffs have been debating for years. Back in 2006, after long being known as a planet, Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet status. Nine years later, with the New Horizons spacecraft having given us the first close-up look at the distant body, the planet-vs.-dwarf-planet debate is once again front and center. Just listen to the experts who joined HuffPost Live on Tuesday. \"I don't think this flyby is going to change the result, that Pluto is demonstrably not a planet,\" said planetary scientist Carolyn Porco. \"It never should have been a planet to begin with. This has been like a 70-year cold case of mistaken identity.\" Advertisement According to the International Astronomical Union , a planet is defined as a body that orbits the Sun, is big enough for gravity to have squished into a round ball, and which has swept away other objects in its orbital neighborhood. Some still believe Pluto qualifies, including Jim Bell, president of The Planetary Society . \"In my personal opinion, this encounter so far makes Pluto demonstrably a planet like many others in the solar system,\" Bell told HuffPost Live. \"Round, core, mantle, crust, atmosphere, five moons, active geology on the surface in the past, maybe in the present -- we'll find out.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

El Ni\u00f1o Brings Extremely Venomous Sea Snakes To California The snakes have made themselves at home in the abnormally warm water off the California coast. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Oct 19, 2015, 03:36 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There's no guarantee El Ni\u00f1o will bring rain to a drought-stricken California, but it has brought venomous sea snakes. People in the southern California city of Oxnard stumbled across a highly venomous yellow-bellied sea snake on the beach last week. Advertisement \"I didn't want some young kid not knowing what it was ... pick it up and possibly get injured,\" Bob Forbes, who found the snake, told ABC News . Forbes said he put the two-foot-long animal in a bucket with water and brought it home to ensure \"people were safe from it.\" He called the authorities, but the snake soon died, according to ABC. (Other beachgoers who reported seeing a snake the previous day likely encountered the same one Forbes did.) If you see a yellow-bellied sea snake, PLS don't handle it! Report it: http://t.co/HeDYEPWq92 pic.twitter.com/OQ9c8Cl10i \u2014 Heal the Bay (@HealTheBay) October 17, 2015 Normally, yellow-bellied sea snakes limit themselves to the warmer areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. This year, a large El Ni\u00f1o, which periodically disrupts the tropical Pacific's normal weather system, is shifting much of that warm water to the north, bringing tropical species -- snakes included -- with it. Advertisement According to Greg Pauly, curator of herpetology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the last time a sea snake washed up in California was in 1972, and it came ashore about 100 miles south of Oxnard. The snake found last week is \" the northernmost sea snake ever documented in the Pacific Coast of North America,\" Pauly told CNN . \"I never would have thought that a sea snake would wash up that far up north.\" \"Because the water is so warm here now, these snakes can swim, hunt and reproduce just like they could in the northern part of their tropical range,\" Dr. Paul Barber, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCLA , told The Huffington Post. \"Simply put, they are here because the warmer El Ni\u00f1o conditions have expanded the range of suitable environmental conditions for this snake. This has also happened with other marine species like hammerhead sharks.\" Advertisement Barber said he expects the snakes will retreat when the water cools back down to its normal temperatures. Despite having \"very, very potent\" venom, Barber said the snakes aren't naturally aggressive animals and will generally only bite if they're handled or feeling defensive. So if you encounter one, call wildlife officials and admire it from a safe distance. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Reveal Secret To Dung Beetles' Impressive Navigation Skills \"It\u2019s really beautiful when you get a proper behavior, especially something fun, like a beetle rolling dung balls.\" By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 27, 2015, 07:34 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Dung beetle brains are built so they can navigate day or night. Credit: Andi Gentsch/Flickr Dung beetles spend their days collecting other animals' poop to feed on. While they may not seem like the most elegant of creatures, it turns out their brains are impressively sophisticated. A study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals the specific brain mechanism in dung beetles that enables them to navigate their environments while simultaneously pushing around giant balls of poop. Advertisement Scientists have long known that dung beetles use the sky to navigate. They are guided by the sun during the day and by the moon or Milky Way during the night . But the new research reveals exactly how the beetle brains' built-in GPS systems use these cues. \"Sometimes in neuroscience we forget that we\u2019re meant to be investigating how the brains of animals create behaviors in [the] real world,\" Dr. Paul Graham, an expert on insect navigation at the University of Sussex in England, who was not involved in this new research, told National Geographic. \"It\u2019s really beautiful when you get a proper behavior\u2014especially something fun, like a beetle rolling dung balls.\" Advertisement For the research, the scientists gave nocturnal and non-nocturnal dung beetles their own balls of poop. When the dung beetles began rolling the balls, the scientists manipulated the sunlight using mirrors, to make the dung beetles think the sun had moved locations. They found that both types of dung beetle were fooled and adjusted their course of movement. But when the scientists used the mirrors to manipulate the location of the moonlight they behaved differently. The non-nocturnal dung beetles were still fooled, but the nocturnal ones weren't and didn't change their path. The scientists discovered this is because their internal navigation system doesn't react to the location of the moon, but the light itself -- called polarized light or scattered light that\u2019s generated by moonlight or light from the Milky Way , National Geographic reported. Humans cannot see polarized lightwaves, but insects and other animals, like bats, can detect them. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The researchers concluded that while the sun or moon dominates the navigation of non-nocturnal dung beetles, the neurons in the brains of nocturnal dung beetles are designed to tune into polarized light at night. The findings help to explain why even on a moonless night, nocturnal dung beetles can navigate tough terrain.

This Health Condition May Afflict Half The World By 2050 Soaring nearsightedness -- driven by staring at computer screens -- \"is a true global health crisis.\" By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 19, 2016, 09:13 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT If you don't already wear eyeglasses, there's a good chance you will by the middle of this century. A new study predicts that by 2050, 4.8 billion people -- about half the global population -- will be afflicted with nearsightedness, or myopia, a common eye malady that causes distant objects to appear blurred while close objects can be seen clearly. That would be a threefold increase from 2000. Additionally, one out of 10 people are predicted to be at risk of blindness. A likely culprit in the surge in myopia, called shortsightedness in some parts of the world, is the amount of time people are spending inside, staring at computer and cellphone screens , according to the study, published online Feb. 11 in the journal Opthalmology. Advertisement Half the world's population may be afflicted with nearsightedness by 2050. Alamy Kovin Naidoo, a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post Australia in an interview that the prediction should be taken seriously. \" This is a true global health crisis , and is rare in that whether you live in Africa or Australia, it will have a huge consequence,\" Naidoo said. Advertisement The study, led by Brien Holden of the Brien Holden Vision Institute in Sydney, crunched data from 145 studies that included 2.1 million participants . It estimated that by 2050, there will be about 4.8 billion people with myopia (49.8 percent of the world population) -- up from an estimated 1.4 billion (23 percent) in 2000. The projected increase in nearsightedness, the authors wrote, is \"widely considered to be driven by environmental factors (nurture), principally lifestyle changes resulting from a combination of decreased time outdoors and increased near work activities, among other factors.\" Family history also is a factor. \"Among environmental factors, so-called high-pressure educational systems, especially at very young ages in countries such as Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, and China, may be a causative lifestyle change, as may the excessive use of near electronic devices.\" Advertisement Naidoo said there's a simple way to prevent myopia: Go outside. \" Some argue it\u2019s about looking at further distances , and there's some evidence that it\u2019s because of a chemical release in the retina,\" Naidoo said. \"More results are coming in around the globe all the time, but the reality is there is acceptance on the fact that spending two hours or more outside is protective.\" Equally as important, Naidoo said in a statement, is that children receive regular eye examinations . So, put down the phone, head outdoors and look to the horizon. Doctor's orders.

U.S. Climate Scientists Flee For France To \u2018Make Our Planet Great Again\u2019 Some of America's top researchers will move to France to continue their research. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost May 3, 2018, 08:42 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Fourteen climate researchers, including six from U.S. universities, have been selected for French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201c Make Our Planet Great Again \u201d initiative. The scientists applied to move to France to carry out climate science projects in the country\u2019s top research laboratories. The selected researchers include some of America\u2019s brightest scientific talents: Alexey Fedorov, a Yale professor and Guggenheim fellow, and James Clark, a Duke University climate expert, according to a press release Wednesday from France\u2019s Ministry of Higher Education and Research. Advertisement Researchers hailing from universities in several other countries, including Canada and Saudi Arabia, also were selected. The applicants\u2019 projects, covering a range of topics including Arctic climate change and improving air quality, are expected to last three to five years. Each researcher will receive at least $600,000 in funding, according to the statement, which noted that Germany is now jointly supporting the initiative. Macron first introduced \u201cMake Our Planet Great Again\u201d last year, after President Donald Trump announced plans to pull the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Macron urged climate scientists and others around the world to apply for an opportunity to work in France. Advertisement Trump\u2019s \u201cdecision is unfortunate but it only reinforced our determination,\u201d Macron said in a message on the initiative\u2019s website . \u201cFrance has always led fights for human rights. Today, more than ever, we are determined to lead (and win!) this battle on climate change.\u201d Macron reiterated his commitment to fighting climate change in an address to the U.S. Congress last week. \u201cWhat is the meaning of our life, really, if we work and live destroying the planet, sacrificing the future of our children?\u201d he asked lawmakers during his visit to Washington. Advertisement Come here with us to work together on concrete solutions for our climate, our environment. pic.twitter.com/JXiqgMP8Xy \u2014 Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) June 1, 2017 The first group of 18 scientists selected for the program was announced in December. That group included 13 researchers from U.S. universities, including Camille Parmesan, a professor at the University of Texas and U.K.\u2019s University of Plymouth who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for her work as a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u201cThe impact of Trump on climate science has been far greater than what the public believe it has,\u201d Parmesan told The Guardian of her decision to move to France to continue her research. \u201cHe has not only slashed funding, but he\u2019s gone on the attack in any way he can with his powers as the president.\u201d Advertisement Before You Go LOADING ERROR LOADING Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Icerko L\u00fddia via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY By Kathleen Bogart , Oregon State University Facial expressions are important parts of how we communicate and how we develop impressions of the people around us. In \"The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals,\" Charles Darwin proposed that facial expressions evolved to quickly communicate emotional states important to social survival. He hypothesized that certain facial expressions are innate, and therefore universally expressed and recognized across all cultures. In 1971, psychology researchers Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen tested Darwin's hypothesis . They enlisted members of the Fore tribe in Papua New Guinea, who at the time had little contact with Western culture, to do an emotion recognition task. An interpreter read stories about emotional events to members of the tribe, such as \"her child has died, and she feels very sad.\" The Fore were then asked to match photos of Americans' facial expressions to the story. The researchers also took photos of the facial expressions of the Fore people and showed them to Americans later. Advertisement People from both cultures showed the same facial expressions for six \"basic\" emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) and were able to recognize their meaning in others. This is strong evidence that certain emotions are evolutionarily based. In the decades since, research has continued to support Darwin's hypothesis: for instance, showing that congenitally blind people display the same spontaneous expressions as sighted people. Indeed, facial expression may be one of the only universal languages. So where does that leave people with facial paralysis? As a psychology professor with Moebius syndrome, a condition involving facial paralysis, I'm personally and professionally interested in what happens when the face is no longer the primary means of expression. My Disability and Social Interaction Lab at Oregon State University has been investigating this question. Kathleen Bogart's Disability and Social Interaction Lab presenting research about Moebius Syndrome Awareness Day. Author provided Advertisement Types of facial paralysis Each year, approximately 225,000 Americans are diagnosed with facial paralysis . It can be congenital, like Moebius syndrome or hereditary facial paralysis . It can also result from birth trauma if the facial nerve is damaged in the birth canal or by forceps delivery. Acquired facial paralysis from an illness or an injury is far more common. Bell's palsy , acoustic neuroma , Lyme disease , stroke , multiple sclerosis , ear infections, injury to the facial nerve and others can all lead to facial paralysis. Bell's palsy, which typically affects one side of the face, is the most common. While it's usually temporary, approximately 15 percent of people with Bell's are left with paralysis that does not improve. In a series of published and unpublished focus groups and interviews, my colleagues and I found that people with facial paralysis reported hearing all sorts of \"interpretations\" of their appearance. Strangers asked them if they had just gotten a Novocain shot, if they were having a stroke, or if the condition was contagious, deadly or painful. Some people made connections to the person's character, assuming them to be unfriendly, unhappy or even intellectually disabled . Advertisement Making a first impression In landmark research published in 1993, psychologists Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal asked strangers to view short (six- to 30-second) silent video clips of high school and college teachers while they were teaching. The strangers then rated their impressions of the teachers' personalities, based on their nonverbal behaviors - things like expressions and gestures. Today this sort of research using very short experiences to form judgments of individual behavior is called thin slice research. The strangers' ratings were remarkably similar to teaching effectiveness ratings from the teachers' students and their supervisors who knew them and their work very well. Our social world has an overwhelming amount of information, but numerous thin slice studies suggest we can navigate it efficiently based on a \"gut\" reaction. People's first impressions are surprisingly accurate in predicting many social characteristics: personality , depression , even gayness . Advertisement Are facial expressions learned or innate? While facial expressions aren't the only thing that go into a first impression, they are a pretty big element. So basing our impressions of others on their facial expressions is usually an effective strategy. However, the accuracy of impressions breaks down when people encounter someone with facial paralysis. At first glance, a person with a paralyzed face may look unfriendly, bored, unintelligent, or even depressed. And indeed, people with facial paralysis are often mistakenly ascribed these characteristics. People with facial paralysis compensate My own research has found that many people with facial paralysis increase expression in their bodies and voices, something I call \"compensatory expression.\" Advertisement In a 2012 study my colleagues and I video-recorded interviews with 27 people with different types of facial paralysis. Research assistants (who were unaware of our hypotheses) watched the interviews and rated the vocal and bodily expressivity of the people with facial paralysis. Interestingly, we found that people with congenital facial paralysis, like Moebius syndrome, used significantly more compensatory expression than people with acquired facial paralysis. For instance, they used more emotion words, vocal inflection, laughter, gestures and head and body movements. They were also louder and more talkative. It's possible that people with congenital facial paralysis are better adapted, perhaps because they navigated early developmental milestones with facial paralysis. Advertisement People who acquired facial paralysis after birth, but have lived with it for a long time, may also adapt well. However, our early data suggest that there may be a unique adaptation advantage for people with congenital conditions. Facial expressions aren't the only way people communicate.

Thin slice research on facial paralysis Facial expressions play such a critical role in forming first impressions, so what does that mean for people with facial paralysis? Advertisement In a series of experiments, we showed thin slice videos of people with disorders that affect facial movement, including facial paralysis and Parkinson's disease to strangers. We asked the strangers for their first impressions based on the videos. People with severe facial movement impairment were rated as less happy and sociable compared to people with mild facial movement impairment. Participants also had less desire to form friendships with them. Our results across these studies have found that there is a very large bias against people with facial movement disorders. Advertisement Crucially, participants rated people with facial paralysis who use a lot of compensatory expression as happier and more sociable than those who use less, regardless of the severity of their paralysis. We are developing communication skills workshops encouraging the use of compensatory expression for people with facial paralysis. In another thin slice study , Linda Tickle-Degnen along with Kathleen Lyons found that even clinicians with expertise in facial movement disorders viewed people with facial movement impairment in negative ways. This indicates how hard it is to override the natural human tendency to form impressions based on the face. And for clinicians, it is of special concern. Their facial expression bias may be a barrier to rapport or even clinical judgments of depression and pain in patients with facial paralysis. Advertisement Raising awareness can help In a recent experiment , we found initial evidence that raising awareness improves how people perceive facial paralysis. Some participants read a few educational paragraphs about facial paralysis (much like the information in this article), and some were not given any information about facial paralysis. Next, all participants watched thin slice videos of people with facial paralysis. The participants who read the educational information rated people with facial paralysis as more sociable than those who did not read the information. We are continuing to develop educational materials for clinicians and the general public to raise awareness and reduce bias. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In our focus groups, the most common comment from people with facial paralysis was a call for greater public awareness. They know firsthand that people are confused by their facial difference. They often wonder if they should explain it to others, but to do so every time they meet someone new would be awkward and burdensome. Widespread awareness would reduce the need to explain their condition, and would educate others to pay attention to the compensatory tactics they use to communicate their emotions.

Hitch A Ride On A Hammerhead Shark For A Blissful Ocean View See what happens when a shark films the ocean bottom with a GoPro camera. By Landess Kearns Senior Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Jul 16, 2015, 05:57 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT If you give a shark a GoPro camera, chances are, you'll be impressed by the view. In an ad for the sports cameras, Shark Week cinematographer Andy Casagrande attaches a GoPro to the dorsal fin of a hammerhead shark in the Bahamas , letting the shark carry the camera wherever it damn well pleases. The footage takes viewers on a brief, but fascinating, undersea adventure from the perspective of the ocean's most misunderstood predator. Advertisement According to Kim Holland, a shark researcher at the University of Hawaii, attaching a camera to a shark for a short period of time is probably not harmful. \"It depends a lot on the duration of the attachment,\" Holland said. \"If it's short, it probably won't harm the shark that much. On the other hand, if it's a short duration attachment, it will add nothing to the scientific understanding of hammerhead shark biology.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Revolutionary War-Era Ship Unearthed At D.C.-Area Construction Site \"It makes you wonder what else is hidden and underneath our ground here.\" By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Jan 6, 2016, 12:21 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The remains of an 18th-century ship were uncovered at a construction site in Alexandria, Virginia, in December. Thunderbird Archeology/Wetland Studies The remains of a Revolutionary War-era ship have been uncovered beneath a hotel construction site outside Washington, D.C., the second archeological find in the area in weeks. A 50-foot-long wooden hull, estimated to be about 250 years old, is currently being excavated in Old Town Alexandria in northern Virginia after its discovery by construction workers last month, archeologists said. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly large ship so it was most likely a trading vessel or a warship,\u201d Boyd Sipe, manager of Thunderbird Archeology, told The Huffington Post Wednesday. Thunderbird Archeology is a division of Wetland Studies, the company that is handling the dig. Archeologists describe the remains -- believed to be just one-third of the ship's hull -- as remarkably preserved, thanks to the area's oxygen-starved mud, where the ship was buried. The wood is estimated to be 250 years old. It was remarkably well-preserved because of its lack of oxygen while buried. Thunderbird Archeology/Wetland Studies Advertisement In a process called \"banking out,\" 18th-century residents intentionally buried the scuttled ship and other wooden objects to extend the shoreline, filling in an area that was once part of the Potomac River. They then covered those structures with soil to create new land, Sipe said. As it turns out, 18th-century man\u2019s trash ended up being 21st-century man\u2019s treasure. \u201cThat's what archeology's all about,\" Sipe said. \"We're the trash collectors for the dead.\" On Tuesday flocks of residents and sightseers crowded around the excavation site, hoping to get a look at the city\u2019s centuries-old secret, located about 8 miles south of the nation's capital. \"It makes you wonder what else is hidden and underneath our ground here,\u201d one admirer told Fox 5 News . Advertisement Archeologists excavate a Revolutionary War-era ship beneath a hotel's construction site. Fox5 \u201cIt\u2019s like a great window into the past,\u201d said another. Though the discovery is a surprise for many, it didn\u2019t come entirely out of the blue. Just a few weeks earlier, the remains of what\u2019s believed to be the city\u2019s first public warehouse, built in 1756, were found near the same site. Its timber, like the ship's, was also well preserved thanks to the soil, archeologists said. Sipe said they have to keep the wood wet, if not completely submerged in water, to prevent it from rotting now that it\u2019s exposed. Advertisement \u201cIt's probably a few weeks to a month before you get sort of irreversible damage [like] mold growing on them,\u201d he said. Another option, should funding not be readily available for the structures' preservation, would be storing the timbers in a lake. Advertisement \u201cIf they're submerged in a lake, that would arrest the decomposition process,\u201d Sipe said. He expects to wrap up work at the site by early next week at the latest, he said. Archeologists are currently working to document the site with photographs, 3D laser scanning and measurements. They\u2019ll then dismantle the beams and transport them to another site where the ruins can be further studied and possibly preserved, he said. Wood samples have also been taken in hopes of analyzing the timbers\u2019 tree ring data to determine the wood's age and where it came from, he said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Fountains Of Fire Used To Erupt On The Moon And Now We Know Why It's just like soda bursting from a shaken-up can. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 26, 2015, 11:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An artist's concept of Earth's moon, representing how some volcanic structures may have looked while active. NASA/Colorado School of Mines/MIT/JPL/GSFC Scientists from Brown University and the Carnegie Institution for Science just solved a moon mystery decades in the making. We have long known that the moon was once home to \"fire fountains,\" a type of volcanic eruption driven by rapidly expanding gas. Astronauts on the Apollo missions in the '70s found hardened beads of glass that were proof of these fiery geysers. But scientists were never quite sure exactly which volatile gas caused fountains -- until now. Advertisement A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Monday finds that carbon caused the moon eruptions when it mixed with oxygen to form expanding carbon monoxide gas. \" The carbon is the one that is producing the large spectacle,\" Dr. Alberto Saal, associate professor of planetary sciences at Brown University and co-author of the new study, said in a statement . Fire fountains also occur on Earth, mostly in Hawaii, but are caused by expanding water and carbon dioxide, not monoxide. This 33-foot high fire fountain erupted from a vent south of Pu\u2018u Kahaualea in Hawaii. Credit: Jim D. Griggs, HVO/U.S. Geological Survey Advertisement For the study, the researchers analyzed the glass beads collected during the Apollo missions and looked for any magma that might have been trapped inside them when they cooled. And -- voila -- the magma they found had traces of carbon monoxide in it. Since the researchers found much higher levels of carbon in the beads with trapped magma than in the moon's volcanic glass overall, they concluded that the carbon monoxide must have been responsible for the fire fountains, Space.com reported. Microscopic bits of molten magma became trapped in glass crystals, preserving evidence of volatile gases. The crystals trap gases present in the magma before they can escape. Credit: Saal Lab/Brown University Advertisement The finding not only sheds new light on the moon's old fire fountains, but also serves as more evidence that our planet and its satellite have a lot in common. The amount of carbon detected in the beads was very similar to the amount found in volcanic rocks on Earth. This new study adds to previous findings that the moon may have formed out of leftover debris when Earth was hit by a Mars-sized object. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Koko The Gorilla Probably Doesn't Understand Climate Change A scientist called the recent viral video of Koko \"highly misleading.\" By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jan 6, 2016, 01:54 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Some scientists are more than a little skeptical of a viral video featuring Koko the gorilla giving a \"speech\" on conservation. Koko is known for her purported ability to use a modified version of American Sign Language to communicate with humans, and her trainers say she knows more than 1,000 signs . The video, which was released during the COP21 Climate Conference in December, shows Koko signing about the importance of protecting nature. Two nonprofits -- the Gorilla Foundation, which oversees Koko's care and training, and NOE Conservation, which seeks to safeguard biodiversity -- produced the video. It concludes with a petition urging the COP21 participants to include \"preservation of biodiversity\" in their agreement. (Check it out below.) Advertisement The video started recirculating on news sites this week with multiple articles touting the importance of Koko's message. But can a gorilla really grasp abstract concepts like climate change and biodiversity? \"Of course not,\" Herbert Terrace, director of Columbia University's Primate Cognition Lab , told The Huffington Post. Terrace criticized the video as \"highly misleading\" because \"we don't know what Koko's trainer was signing to her before she uttered the various signs \u2026 attributed to her.\" Advertisement The press release accompanying the video notes that Koko received an initial \"script\" to work with. However, the release also claims that Koko was \"briefed\" on climate change with an issue of National Geographic, that she was \"very interested\" in the subject matter and that she was \"allowed to improvise\" for the purposes of the video. The release says that \"Koko was clear about the main message\" and refers to her as the \"voice of Nature.\" Additionally, NOE's YouTube page includes a note from the Gorilla Foundation describing the footage as \"Koko reacting after she has been informed about what is at stake at COP21.\" College of William and Mary professor Barbara King , a biological anthropologist who has studied monkeys and apes for years, believes that Koko certainly has the ability to understand and express isolated signs and strings of gestures. But \"there's a big leap between her basic linguistic skills\" and the ability to grasp complicated ecological ideas, King said, and there's just no evidence that Koko can do the latter. Advertisement \u201cKoko's human-coached message goes well beyond anything that a gorilla understands or cares about.\u201d - Frans de Waal \"There's nothing in the published literature that would support the claim that Koko could understand these concepts,\" King said. Frans de Waal, director of Emory University's Living Links primate research center , suggested that the conservation video hurts the credibility of those who study animal intelligence. Advertisement \"Koko's human-coached message goes well beyond anything that a gorilla understands or cares about, such as human global impact,\" de Waal told HuffPost. He added that \"stunts\" like this one \"have given the ape-language field a bad name, whereas there is so much more to discover if we just study what cognitively advanced animals can do of their own accord.\" As King noted in an NPR article last month , the video's anthropomorphism is a bit ironic in a video championing biodiversity. Instead of celebrating the differences between gorillas and humans, the video gives the impression that apes are \"furry versions of ourselves,\" she wrote. And that obscures Koko's actual abilities. \"The problem comes in when we take an ape's accomplishments and then ... insist ... on putting her forward as a wise old woman, and she's not,\" King said.
