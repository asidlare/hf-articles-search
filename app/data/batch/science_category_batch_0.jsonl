Rods and Cones are Not Alone There are approximately 120 million rods and 6 million cones in the retina which help us to see, but did you know there is another type of light sensitive cell there? Intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells are a type of cell in our retina that has nothing to do with our vision. By Cheryl G.

There are approximately 120 million rods and 6 million cones in the retina which help us to see, but did you know there is another type of light sensitive cell there? Intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells, or ipRGCs for short, are a type of cell in our retina that has nothing to do with our vision but it does sense light. It is particularly sensitive to blue wavelength light like that of the bright blue sky but it can also be stimulated by sources of blue light not found in nature (like that emitted by our smart phones, tablets, computer screens and TVs). In the 1990s Czeisler et al found that these ipRGCs are present and functioning in people with certain types of blindness. So even though these people could not see or perceive the presence of light, their retina still sensed it thanks to their ipRGCs and their circadian rhythm was set by it. Science hidden in plain sight, indeed.

Massive 'Pillars Of Destruction' Show Stars Destroying Their Own Formation Clouds The pillars are located in the Carina Nebula, 7,500 light years from Earth. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Nov 3, 2016, 03:56 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It\u2019s an act of violence on a cosmic scale. New images from the European Southern Observatory \u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile showed the massive \u201c Pillars of Destruction \u201d in the Carina Nebula , some 7,500 light years from Earth: ASSOCIATED PRESS Advertisement The images revealed a \u201cnursery\u201d of new stars, which were wiping out the very clouds from which they formed. \u201cIn an ironic twist, one of the first consequences of the formation of a massive star is that it starts to destroy the cloud from which it was born ,\u201d the ESO wrote in a news release. That destruction led to scenes that looked like the cover of a 1960s psychedelic album. Some of the nicknames even sounded like the titles of those albums, such as the Mystic Mountain, a formation of gas and dust that spans more than three light years: Advertisement ESOA McLeod The pillars were being attacked from both inside and out, according to the ESO. Inside the pillars, newborn stars were emitting jets of gas, which were the rays that seemed to be coming from the peaks of the pillars. On the outside, they were slammed with the intense light of newly-formed stars nearby. Advertisement The new images and animations were taken with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer by a team of researchers led by Anna McLeod , a doctoral student at ESO studying how massive stars influence their environment. \u201cThese pillars might look dense, but the clouds of dust and gas which make up nebulae are actually very diffuse,\u201d ESO stated. \u201cIt is possible that the radiation and stellar winds from massive stars actually help create denser spots within the pillars, which can then form stars.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In just one blistering tweet Wednesday, the astrophysicist threw major shade on the Trump administration\u2019s controversial climate change policies \u2014 and suggested why it was considering withdrawing from the landmark deal in the first place.

Spreading Pseudoscience: 5 Reasons Why Some Liberals Are as Bad as Conservatives The first step to solving problems is to identify and understand them. With that in mind, here is a list of five reasons why some liberals are just as bad, or at least almost, as creationism-believing conservatives when it comes to spreading pseudoscience. By Bobby Azarian, Contributor Neuroscientist, Journalist (www.bobbyazarian.com) Neuroscientist, Journalist (www.bobbyazarian.com) Feb 25, 2015, 10:56 AM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

With the recent measles outbreak in Disneyland being linked to largely unvaccinated districts in Southern California, it is apparent that we are in the midst of a time when misinformation is running rampant. Although anti-science sentiment has historically been found in highly religious and deeply conservative rural areas, these anti-vaxxers reside predominantly in affluent liberal communities like Marin County . Additionally (and disappointingly), similar anti-science rhetoric is coming from prominent left-wing figures like liberal talk show host Bill Maher. As a liberal myself -- and especially as a scientist -- I find the present situation to be particularly disturbing. Advertisement There is indeed a real problem, but problems have solutions. And the first step to solving problems is to identify and understand them. With that in mind, below is a list of five reasons why some liberals are just as bad, or at least almost, as creationism-believing conservatives when it comes to spreading pseudoscience. 1. Homeopathy Walk into a Whole Foods grocery store -- which can be found in just about any over-privileged, predominantly white neighborhood -- and you're bound to find two things: overenthusiastic liberal extremists and homeopathic remedies for everything from the flu to cancer . Yes, I said the 'C' word, and yes, that should scare you. These products do more than just steal people's money. They often put them in real danger by suggesting that proven medical treatment might not be necessary, even in dire situations. In fact, many experts believe Steve Jobs could've better fought or even defeated cancer had he not spent a year testing out herbal remedies before choosing to undergo surgery, a decision he himself later regretted. Advertisement This is a billion dollar industry that profits exclusively from a widespread lack of science education -- in particular a basic knowledge of physiology, health and medicine. Countless studies in peer-reviewed journals have shown these homeopathic quick fixes to work no better than placebos . Remember folks, being open-minded doesn't entail giving fair attention to frauds and their scams, even if they are dressed like the harmless hippies we know and love. 2. New Age It is well known that new age-y, crystal-worshipping, astrology-believing loonies are almost always diehard liberals. What is it that these people actually believe anyway? One popular idea is that each of us gives off certain positive or negative \"energies\" that can influence others nearby, as well as important events. Unsurprisingly, there is not one shred of scientific evidence that suggests any such mysterious energies exist. Advertisement Another common conviction is that we are all capable of \" channeling \" information from outside entities (spirits, aliens, the elements, etc.) during deep states of trance. And to really confuse matters, new agers attempt to explain all of these magical occurrences using pseudoscientific jargon they've invented, which for some reason always references quantum physics. While the phenomena observed in quantum mechanical experiments definitely have very peculiar aspects , these certainly have nothing to do with supernatural healing or reaching your full potential. It may not be obvious, but these quasi-religious beliefs from some on the left hurt the entire party. Progressives need to be able to stand up and harshly criticize Republicans for their anti-evolution stance, but how can they do so when a portion of them believe in myths and fantasies that are just as ridiculous? Shape up liberal kooks. Don't let new age mumbo jumbo destroy the whole group's credibility. You do not have a \"vibration\", because that means nothing. Advertisement 3. Anti-Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) For 20 years scientists have genetically modified foods (e.g., corn, soybean) to be more resistant to things like disease and insects, while richer in nutrients and healthier overall . Essentially, their genetic tweaks are creating superhero plants, which regrettably look more like scary mutants in the eyes of the fearful. But this time the fearful predominantly consists of liberals rather than Fox News -obsessed conservatives. These people hold the belief that any gene-tinkerings will produce Franken-foods capable of causing illnesses and tumors. With only homeopathic remedies at their disposal, they have good reason to be extra paranoid of such things. The liberal-driven anti-GMO movement is proof that poor decision-making rooted in irrational fear is not behavior restricted to those on the right. Despite overwhelming scientific evidence that genetically-altered foods are as safe as any , some ultra-environmentalist types want to see the GMO industry burn to the ground, quite literally . This is a great misfortune considering all the good that GM crops and their high yields could do for some very important liberal causes, like the global fight against hunger. You would think that those in support of greater spending on education would do a little bit more to educate themselves. Advertisement 4. Anti-Vaccines Out of all the anti-science movements being driven predominantly by liberals, none is more dangerous than that which claims vaccinations are harmful or unnecessary. Empirical evidence shows that each year vaccines prevent millions of illnesses and save hundreds of thousands of lives. This is supported by the fact that the recent slew of vaccine-preventable illness outbreaks all occurred specifically in those areas where people refused vaccinations . So why then are prominent left-leaning celebrities choosing to take the kind of stance usually reserved for far-right conspiracy theorists? It's not just airheads like Jenny McCarthy either. Joining the crazies are some very seemingly rational people, like comedic liberal talk show host Bill Maher and actor Jim Carrey. Baffling, I know. An even less likely anti-vaxxer is Mayim Bialik from The Big Bang Theory (or Blossom to you '80s babies), who not only plays a scientist on TV but also holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience in real life! These people surely aren't dumb, so what's going on here? Advertisement Essentially what is happening is that well-educated people think that because they hold a higher degree and have done a week's worth of Google -ing, they know more than the bright minds who've dedicated their lives to understanding this very specific area of research. To those people, look, I get it. The truth is that we as scientists don't know everything. Fear is a reasonable first instinct when one is told that vaccines actually work by giving you a weakened version of the same virus it's trying to prevent. But when the stakes are so high, you have to go with the side that science is on. Without having some additional knowledge inaccessible to the guys in lab coats, you can bet that the best conclusions come from the most informed. Science is unique in that it has no hidden agenda and is self-correcting. So when you haven't really done your research but think you know something that the experts don't, you can assume that your beliefs are motivated by hubris rather than the facts. 5. Alternative Therapies Some popular alternative therapies within certain liberal communities include energy medicine , aromatherapy , Chinese acupuncture , and crystal healing . Hopefully I need not explain to the reader exactly why mystical energies, scents, tiny needles, or neat-looking crystals all fail to cure the sick. Advertisement As freakin' hilarious as all of it sounds, it is no laughing matter. These rituals present the same grave danger as homeopathy, since individuals undergoing alternative therapies may avoid seeking out real medical help. Don't get me wrong about mind-body oriented practices. A little yoga and meditation can work wonders for ailments like chronic stress and even high blood pressure. But stretching and breathing techniques used to calm oneself are entirely different than putting a crystal under your pillow and expecting an ear infection to disappear overnight. It's ironic that these liberals scoff at the sheer absurdity of Christian faith healing when some of them hold beliefs in supernatural cures that are even more \"out there.\" Advertisement So there you have it. It seems that ignorance has no party affiliation, and that widespread gullibility is a serious problem in this country that must be addressed. Although the anti-science rhetoric coming from the right is ultimately a more destructive brand, the left's is similarly counterproductive. For a country so seemingly advanced and progressive, we are still in the dark ages in a lot of respects. It is tempting to think that all our problems could be solved by taking politicians on both sides out of the decision-making chairs and replacing them with scientists. Oh how fair and efficient the world would be if governing were based on reason and measurement. But it must also be guided by humanity and compassion, which requires all of society's input. So although we needn't all be scientists, we should each be empiricists. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Finally, it is important to note that science is not incompatible with spirituality. In fact, science can serve as a deeply inspirational source of the spiritual. But when beliefs contradict what is observed in reality, they must be discarded and supplanted with new, better explanations. When we are all able to come together under science and rationality, only then will we see real bipartisan progress.

A Big, Scary Whirlpool Forms In Lake Texoma WATCH: Freaky Vortex Opens Up In Flooded Lake By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 27, 2015, 11:43 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT On Lake Texoma along the Texas-Oklahoma border, boaters have to be very careful or they could wind up going down the drain--literally. That's because a giant vortex measuring eight feet across formed recently in the overflowing lake. The swirling waters got going when engineers opened the floodgates of the Denison Dam to drain the lake, which was flooded from four weeks of heavy rain. Advertisement A video of the vortex (above) posted to the YouTube page of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Tulsa District on June 5, 2015 shows just how big the vortex is--and how powerful. Officials warned in the video's description that it's capable of sucking in a full-sized boat. (Story continues below.) The vortex that formed at Lake Texoma. \u201cI always compare it to when you fill up your bathtub and then pull the plug. When the water level gets low enough, you\u2019ll see an apparent vortex ,\u201d B.J. Parkey, assistant project manager at the lake, told ABC News. \u201cObviously we don\u2019t have a plug like that in the dam, but the concept is the same.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Can The Bacteria In Your Gut Explain Your Mood? Your Gut Bacteria Does More Than You Might Think By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 24, 2015, 01:24 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists at PNNL are developing a model of the microbial environment inside the human gut. This model is composed of three-dimensional human intestinal cells cultured with specific gut bacteria. Changes in certain bacterial populations within the gut have been attributed to colon cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer\u00e2s and Huntington\u00e2s diseases. The three-dimensional model provides an approach to study how changes in bacteria affect gut health and overall human health. Research was funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and PNNL\u00e2s Laboratory Directed Research and Development initiative in chemical imaging.Team Members from PNNL: Janine Hutchison, Alice Dohnalkova, Becky Hess, Helen Kreuzer and Timothy Straub.

Eighteen vials were rocking back and forth on a squeaky mechanical device the shape of a butcher scale, and Mark Lyte was beside himself with excitement. \u2018\u2018We actually got some fresh yesterday \u2014 freshly frozen,\u2019\u2019 Lyte said to a lab technician. Each vial contained a tiny nugget of monkey feces that were collected at the Harlow primate lab near Madison, Wis., the day before and shipped to Lyte\u2019s lab on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center campus in Abilene, Tex. Lyte\u2019s interest was not in the feces per se but in the hidden form of life they harbor. The digestive tube of a monkey, like that of all vertebrates, contains vast quantities of what biologists call gut microbiota. The genetic material of these trillions of microbes, as well as others living elsewhere in and on the body, is collectively known as the microbiome. Taken together, these bacteria can weigh as much as six pounds, and they make up a sort of organ whose functions have only begun to reveal themselves to science. Lyte has spent his career trying to prove that gut microbes communicate with the nervous system using some of the same neurochemicals that relay messages in the brain.

Meet The Doctor Behind The Most Extreme Face Transplant Ever Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez did what no surgeon had ever done -- and he's just getting started. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Nov 1, 2016, 02:15 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Last August, Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez performed the most extensive face transplant operation ever. In the 26-hour operation, which took place at New York University Langone Medical Center, the dentist-turned-plastic-surgeon and his team removed the face and scalp of a young victim of a fatal accident and successfully grafted the tissue onto the head of Patrick Hardison, a firefighter who had been horribly burned in a 2001 fire. The operation showed in dramatic fashion just how far organ transplantation has come since its start in 1954, when surgeons at Brigham Hospital in Boston took a kidney from one man and gave it to his twin. Advertisement In the six decades since then, doctors learned how to transplant not just kidneys but also hearts, lungs, livers and other \u201csolid\u201d organs. Now they\u2019re transplanting faces, hands, arms, uteruses, penises and other body parts that \u2015 unlike solid organs \u2015 are made up of multiple tissues, including blood vessels, muscle and bone. \u201cIt is an exciting time, and the future of organ transplantation continues to evolve,\u201d Rodriguez told The Huffington Post in an email. Rodriguez wants face transplantation to become the \u201cstandard of care for individuals in need.\u201d But this will happen only if some major obstacles are overcome. The high cost of these procedures is one: Who will pay for operations like face transplants, which in the case of the injured firefighter cost an estimated $1 million? Advertisement Then there\u2019s the matter of encouraging donations not only of organs but also faces and other body parts that seem more personal. Adults can sign up to become organ donors after death (agreements commonly shown on driver licenses), but so far faces and other composite body parts are donated by deceased individuals\u2019 family members. \u201cFamilies sometimes refrain from donating their loved ones\u2019 face because they are afraid to possibly see their deceased family member in public,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cHowever, we researched this area of concern and found that a transplanted face actually blends the two identities to create a new appearance that is unique to the face transplant recipient.\u201d In any case, Rodriguez applauds the generosity of the family of the man whose face became Hardison\u2019s. He\u2019s also appreciative of Hardison, whose compliance with follow-up care has been key to his recovery \u2015 and whose willingness to go public about his experience has brought new attention to transplant surgery. Advertisement \u201cSimply put, Pat is a hero,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cBy sharing his story, he has given so much hope to those who need it, and has shown the true impact organ donation has had on himself and his family.\u201d Rodriguez has fans of his own. In a message to HuffPost, Hardison called his doctor \u201cone of a kind\u201d before adding, \u201cHe\u2019s family to me.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Humble Honeybee The Humble Honeybee By Dr Reese Halter, Contributor Broadcaster, Biologist Broadcaster, Biologist Jun 9, 2017, 06:19 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT Honeybee loading pollen into her corbicula (or pollen basket) from lemon blossom in Hollywood, Calif. Photo credit: Reese Halter Honeybees are incomparable little creatures. Allow me to tell you why: Honeybees and humans share many things in common: we socialize, dance, eat honey, touch, feel, mimic one another, sleep, enjoy nicotine, caffeine, vote and we both get sick. After a queen honeybee lays a couple million eggs, she begins to produce fewer pheromones (or chemical scents), which cause the worker bees to feed half a dozen larvae royal jelly or pure protein as they begin rearing a new queen. Advertisement It\u2019s up to the scout bees to locate a new site to move the existing queen and thousands of workers to create with their beeswax a new hive. The bees reach a consensus on a new location by voting. Research has shown that 15 is the crucial number of scout bees for a quorum. Then they wait for the signal to evacuate. Are you like me and millions of other people who find our morning caffeine buzz irresistible? Well \u2013 we\u2019re not alone \u2013 our friends the honeybees also seek a morning buzz from flowers containing nectar laced with caffeine. That caffeine boosts the bees\u2019 memories causing the buzzed forager bees, returning to the hive, to dance vigorously and communicate to other bees the precise location of the caffeinated flowers. It seems that some plants have evolved an ingenious mechanism of using caffeine as a drug to get the upper hand on the bees to pollinate their flowers first. Not only do bees pollinate 75 percent of all the world\u2019s food crops, but also all the cotton we wear. Honeybees produce an astounding 2.6 billion pounds of honey each year for humans. One teaspoon of honey weighing 21 grams contains 16 grams of sugar or 60 calories. It takes 12 honeybees a combined flying distance of about 6,000 miles , or their entire foraging lives, to produce those 21 grams of honey. Normally, a forager honeybees dies because after flying 500 miles in three weeks and visiting almost a million flowers, she wears her wings out or to put it another way \u2013 she works herself to death. Advertisement These admirable little creatures can count to four and they can be trained to arrive at three, four and five separate periods during 24 hours. For the previous 15 years, my colleagues have been training honeybees to identify over 60 different odors ranging from enriched uranium to tuberculosis, methamphetamine (or crystal meth) and TNT the main explosive in landmines. Honeybees are now being deployed instead of sniffer dogs to locate more than 250,000 landmines at sites left behind in the 1990s war in former Yugoslavia. By the way, sniffer dogs cost $9,000 each, are accurate approximately 71 percent of the time, require three months of intensive training and they get maimed. Honeybees, on the other hand, are accurate 98 percent of the time, require less than 10 minutes of training and they preclude sniffer dogs from being harmed or killed. By finding those unexploded landmines our friends the humble honeybees will help prevent the maiming of hundreds of children playing in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Just like people and dogs, bees get sad when they are handled or manipulated too much or if they don\u2019t get enough sleep when predators repeatedly attack them. Bees learn while asleep and they may dream too. Bees show similar signs of pessimism seen in depressed or anxious people. Honeybees and people even share genetic similarities. Some thrill seeking honeybees , just like people, are drawn to adventure. And there are over 1,000 genetic differences that affect a bee\u2019s likelihood of being a thrill seeker. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

There are approximately one million neurons in a bee\u2019s brain and some of those neurons are responsible for giving honeybees distinct personalities . The more we learn about the bees, the more remarkable these creatures become. Advertisement Bee deaths in America are at an all time annual high of 44 percent . In addition, 749 native bee species in North America and Hawaii are heading towards extinction from pesticides, habitat loss and the climate crisis . It\u2019s long over due that we protect the bees, at all costs, from deadly neonicotinoid pesticides. We need healthy bees in order to feed a human population adding almost 90 million people a year, as the United Nations predicts we will top 8.5 billion humans by 2030.

North Pole Temperature Jumps Above Freezing From Bizarre Storms It's unusually warm for being the North Pole. By Michael McLaughlin Reporter, HuffPost Dec 30, 2015, 02:58 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Update (December 31, 2015): There has been some debate about how warm it actually got near the North Pole on Wednesday. One buoy maintained by the International Arctic Buoy Program recorded a high temperature of about 33-degrees Fahrenheit . But Dr. Jamie Morison, principal investigator for the North Pole Environmental Observatory, said in a statement that a buoy closer to the North Pole recorded a high temperature of only about 16-degrees Fahrenheit , which is still much hotter than average in winter. \"So in summary, the forecast warming was qualitatively pretty good even though temperatures at the Pole didn't reach up to the freezing point,\" he said. The Washington Post, however, reports that data from the Global Forecast System (GFS) forecast model showed high temperatures at a latitude of 90 degrees North \"for at least a brief moment\" exceeding the melting point . --- A combination of rare and powerful weather conditions were predicted to raise temperatures at the North Pole to more than 50 degrees Fahrenheit above average on Wednesday. The forecast appeared correct as a reading on a weather buoy drifting in ice near the pole climbed above the freezing point -- an almost unthinkable temperature for the Arctic in the middle of winter considering there's no daylight for weeks. If the reading was accurate, it was warmer there than in some cities , such as Moscow and Chicago , The Guardian reports. Advertisement Bit warm at the North Pole! Thanks to #StormFrank the temp is a very rare +1\u00b0C compared to the average -28\u00b0C... pic.twitter.com/pZi5y4kZCi \u2014 Simon King (@SimonOKing) December 30, 2015 The bizarre, and in some cases cataclysmic, weather reached across other regions of the North Atlantic on Wednesday. Forecasts said hurricane-force winds would blast Iceland. In fact, the storm threatened to be one of the most powerful on record in the North Atlantic. One feature of the weather is a sudden and severe loss of barometric pressure. If it drops fast enough, it could unleash a phenomenon ominously called a \"bomb cyclone,\" according to The Washington Post . Advertisement The low-pressure system disturbing the normal Arctic conditions is the same behemoth that produced devastating cyclones in the southern United States and triggered flooding along the Mississippi River in recent days. Called Storm Frank in the United Kingdom, the heavy rain and strong winds are looming over the U.K., which is reeling from severe flooding there over the weekend. Temps at the North Pole may rise above freezing today with the Jet Stream and #StormFrank pushing warm air north! pic.twitter.com/Dau3pkmNou \u2014 Derek Brockway (@DerekTheWeather) December 30, 2015 Advertisement Temperatures above freezing could halt, at least temporarily, the growth of winter ice, the BBC reported. Diminishing ice coverage is associated with rising sea levels and can be hazardous to low-lying coastal communities. The Arctic is experiencing a period of rapid warming, according to a recent report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The region is heating up twice as fast as anywhere in the world, the 2015 Arctic Report Card notes, and its average temperature is 5.2 degrees higher than it was in 1900. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Past and Future of (Same-Sex) Marriage Legal experts can parse the finer points of the majority opinion and the four separate dissents, but let's take this momentous occasion as an opportunity to reflect on where we have been on this issue, and what the future may hold. By Kathleen E. Hull, Contributor Associate Professor of Sociology, University of Minnesota Associate Professor of Sociology, University of Minnesota Jun 28, 2015, 05:44 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. With its ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges , the U.S. Supreme Court took a step that seemed unimaginable two decades ago, when I started researching same-sex marriage. Many politicians, pundits and commentators have rightly hailed the Court's decision as both just and historic. Legal experts can parse the finer points of the majority opinion and the four separate dissents, but let's take this momentous occasion as an opportunity to reflect on where we have been on this issue, and what the future may hold. First, a look backward. Although the dissents in Obergefell claimed that Americans should be given more time to sort out this issue through the democratic process, the history of the struggle over same-sex marriage is actually rather long. The first court ruling on the issue dates back to 1971, when the Minnesota Supreme Court found in Baker v. Nelson that neither the state nor the federal constitution guaranteed a right to same-sex marriage. But the issue really broke into public consciousness in the mid-1990s, when another state supreme court -- this time in Hawaii -- ruled its state constitution did in fact require the state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Advertisement That ruling prompted Congress to pass the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, and many state legislatures (including Hawaii's) passed their own \"baby DOMAs\" to ensure they would not have to recognize same-sex marriages. Then in 2004 Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and for the next decade opponents and advocates of marriage equality fought ferocious and emotional battles in state after state. Speaking in the Rose Garden shortly after the Obergefell decision came down, President Obama lauded the ruling and asserted that the result was a consequence of \"countless small acts of courage\" by people who came out to others and stood up for themselves. Obama framed the marriage victory as \"a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things,\" and those words resonated for me as I thought about the plaintiffs in the earliest marriage cases -- in Minnesota, Hawaii and elsewhere -- who pursued dignity and equal treatment on their own, without the support of a coordinated, strategic effort by the national LGBT rights movement. Indeed, it was only after the initial favorable ruling in Hawaii that the national gay rights groups were willing to devote significant attention and resources to the marriage issue, a detail that is easy to forget after years of high-profile, professionalized activism on marriage equality. Even those in the LGBT community who think other issues should have had priority over marriage, or who reject the institution outright, must be heartened by this evidence that major social change that starts at the grassroots is still achievable in our age of deep political cynicism and polarization. Advertisement The little-noted irony of the marriage equality victory is that it arrives at a moment when more heterosexual Americans are turning away from marriage. This \"retreat from marriage,\" as family scholars call it, manifests in lower marriage rates, a higher age at first marriage, more children born to unmarried parents, and a high divorce rate. The causes of the retreat from marriage are complex, but it's clear the phenomenon is not spread evenly over the American population; it is disproportionately people on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder who are delaying or foregoing marriage, or dissolving their existing marriages. The economic conditions produced by de-industrialization and globalization are a significant factor: Stagnant wages and employment insecurity place less-educated Americans in a precarious position, and many now view marriage as a kind of middle-class luxury good that is out of reach or irrelevant to their daily struggles to survive. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Recognizing this larger reality of American marriage does not negate the value of expanding marriage rights to include same-sex couples, but as we celebrate marriage equality we must also acknowledge that the broader retreat from marriage is both a cause and a consequence of widening economic inequalities in our country. The optimism and enthusiasm of same-sex couples choosing marriage may be refreshing, but it will probably do little to reverse these broader trends. Where are we headed? In the short term, the nationalization of same-sex marriage recognition will further increase the cultural visibility of sexual minorities and \"alternative\" family forms. Legal battles over same-sex marriage will shift to the terrain of religious liberty, where opponents of marriage equality will seek to use religious freedom arguments as grounds for ongoing discrimination against same-sex couples. Even if those legal fights are resolved fairly quickly, it will not be time for the LGBT rights movement to declare victory and close up shop. Advertisement The majority of U.S. states still lack anti-discrimination laws covering sexual orientation and gender identity, and efforts to pass a federal employment non-discrimination law have failed repeatedly in Congress. Hate crimes and bullying continue to pose difficult and sometimes life-threatening challenges for sexual minorities and gender variant people. And while Caitlyn Jenner's coming out has generated mostly positive reactions, transgender rights issues are only starting to get the attention they require. Finally, I hope that LGBT folk of all political persuasions will view the marriage victory as an invaluable opportunity to dedicate our resources and creativity to more coalition-building with other groups fighting for social justice. In public statements on the steps of the Supreme Court right after the ruling was announced, both lead plaintiff James Obergefell and plaintiffs' attorney Mary Bonauto made a point to acknowledge the deep pain of the Charleston massacre and the reality that discrimination and hate persist in many forms in contemporary America. I thank them for using their moment in the public spotlight to link LGBT rights struggles to other important issues confronting our nation. Their sentiments represent the most inspiring and expansive elements of the LGBT rights crusade: a recognition of the importance of dignity and equality for all people, of how struggles for social justice are interlinked, and of the power of coalitions to create strength greater than the sum of their parts.

Here's More Evidence That Good-Looking People Can Get Away With Anything Here's More Evidence That Good-Looking People Can Get Away With Anything By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jun 29, 2015, 11:11 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Good-looking people seem to have all the luck. Thanks to the \"beauty bias,\" our largely unconscious preoccupation with and preference for physically attractive people, not only are more attractive people often ascribed positive personality traits like intelligence and kindness, but they also tend to be given unfair advantages in both the workplace and in legal proceedings . New research also suggests beautiful women have an easier time taking advantage of men financially. The research, conducted by Chinese psychologists and recently published in the journal Frontiers in Neuroscience , found that men are more likely to accept an unfair offer when it comes from a beautiful woman. Why? It seems that female beauty undermines the brain's reaction to fairness and unfairness, which in turn skewed the men's judgments. Advertisement \"The results are in line with previous findings in the area: people behave nicely toward attractive people,\" University of Stirling psychologist Anthony Little , who was not involved in the study but has conducted research on visual perception and attractiveness, told The Huffington Post. \"This study finds that people are also more forgiving toward attractive people when they behave 'unfairly' in the game, which suggests that attractive people can get away with being meaner in life because their beauty means that people forgive them.\" For the study , 21 male students at a Chinese university were asked to view 300 photographs of the faces of Chinese women -- half of whom had been rated attractive and half unattractive by a different group of men. Then, the men played a computer game in which they were teamed up with some of the women whose faces they had just viewed. In the game, they viewed the women's faces and then decided whether to accept their proposal to split a small cash sum. Meanwhile, the researchers measured their brain waves and response times. What did they find? As hypothesized, the men were more likely to accept an unfair offer when it came from an attractive woman. When the \"proposers\" were attractive women, the men were both quicker to respond to fair offers and slower to respond to unfair offers. Advertisement The brain scans of the male subjects revealed greater reward activation when the attractive women proposed offers, as well as a heightened sensitivity and dissatisfaction with unfair offers when the women were unattractive. But it's not entirely clear why we behave differently toward attractive people, according to Little. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So, we appear to have a bias toward being nice to attractive people even when the rewards to ourselves, such as increasing the chance of a date, wouldn\u2019t apply,\" Little said. \"This suggests our motivations to be nice to attractive people are unlikely to be based on conscious decisions to maximize our own benefits.\" Advertisement The bottom line?

How Meditation Primes The Mind For Spiritual Experiences How Mindfulness Meditation Expands Awareness By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 1, 2015, 09:56 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Silhouette of Caucasian woman on beach at sunset The practice of mindfulness dates back at least 2,500 years to early Buddhism, and since then, it's played an important role in a number of spiritual traditions. While the stillness and connecting with one's inner self cultivated through mindfulness are certainly an important part of a spiritual practice, feelings of wonder and awe -- the amazement we get when faced with incredible vastness -- are also central to the spiritual experience. And according to new research, mindfulness may actually set the stage for awe. Advertisement Mindfulness is the key element of the spiritual experience in a number of different religions. Awe is defined as a feeling of amazement of fascination and amazement invoked by an encounter with something larger than ourselves that is beyond our ordinary frameworks of understanding. Previous research has shown that spirituality, nature and art are the most common ways that we experience awe. \"You can't digest [the object of awe] with your cognitive structures -- it's too big for you,\" University of Groningen psychologist Dr. Brian Ostafin told the Huffington Post. \"So there's a need for accommodation, to change your mental structures to understand what that is. This is the key element of the spiritual experience in a number of different religions.\" Ostafin recently conducted several studies that shed light on the relationship between mindfulness and awe -- two of the core elements of many spiritual traditions. Advertisement For one study, Ostafin and colleagues recruited 64 undergraduate participants to view and respond to a number of images. All of participants were shown two sets of images: One set of images was used to inspire awe (the Grand Canyon, majestic mountains, a view of the Earth from space) while the others were meant to inspire feelings of positivity (kittens, flowers, baby chicks), and asked to rate their awe and positivity responses on a scale of 1 to 7. Prior to viewing the images, half of the participants listened to a 10-minute mindfulness audio tape, while the other half listened to non-mindfulness control audio. The participants who took part in the brief mindfulness exercise experienced a greater awe reaction than the control group in response to the awe-provoking images. By way of explanation, Ostafin had this to offer: \"Awe involves that assimilation -- giving up your cognitive structures in order to accommodate [the object of awe]. And mindfulness is a little bit about that too, because you're paying attention and exercising non-conceptual awareness, so you should be more open to the immensity that's there. You step out of the small frame that you have and this small idea of what the world is... You're not stuck in your own story.\" The relationship between mindfulness and awe also seems to be mediated by accomodation, Ostafin said. When we practice mindfulness (the cultivation of a focused, non-judgmental awareness on the present moment), we're more able to open our mind to make sense of new experiences. The findings shed light on the link between meditation and spiritual experiences, and also suggest that mindfulness practices may be effective in facilitating feelings of awe, which have been associated with improved well-being and creativity and reduced inflammation . The findings were presented at the annual Society for Personality and Social Psychology conference in Long Beach.

Why The Science Behind Anti-Depressants May Be Completely 'Backwards' Why This Psychologist Thinks The Science Behind Anti-Depressants May Be Completely 'Backwards' By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 28, 2015, 11:30 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT UNITED STATES - JANUARY 29: Eli Lilly & Co. antidepressant Cymbalta is arranged for display at C O Bigelow Pharmacy in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2008. Eli Lilly & Co., the world's biggest maker of psychiatric drugs, said fourth-quarter profit rose more than six-fold on increased sales of the antidepressant Cymbalta and impotency pill Cialis. (Photo by Jb Reed/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Anti-depressants are the most commonly-prescribed medication in the U.S. , with one in 10 Americans currently taking pills like Zoloft and Lexapro to treat depression. But these pharmaceuticals are only fully effective roughly 30 percent of the time , and often come with troublesome side effects. In a controversial new paper published in the journal Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews , psychologist Paul Andrews of McMaster University in Ontario argues that this failure of medication may be based in a misunderstanding of the underlying chemistry related to depression. Advertisement Andrews surveyed 50 years' worth of research supporting the serotonin theory of depression , which suggests that the disease is caused by low levels of the \"happiness\" neurotransmitter, serotonin. But Andrews argues that depression may actually be caused by elevated levels of serotonin. And this fundamental misunderstanding may be responsible for inappropriate treatment: The most common form of antidepressants are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which operate by targeting serotonin receptors in the brain in an effort to amplify serotonin production. Currently, scientists are unable to measure precisely how the brain releases and uses serotonin, because it can't be safely observed in a human brain. But Andrews points to research on animals which suggests that serotonin might work just the opposite from what we've assumed. Advertisement In this scenario, elevated serotonin levels that are released and used by the brain during depressive episodes trigger processes that promote rumination -- the obsessive negative thinking that is the hallmark of depression. Then, because they facilitate the production of serotonin, SSRI treatments exacerbate rumination and actually worsen symptoms of depression, especially at first, Andrews explained. Over time, in some cases, the SSRIs can reverse ruminative processes and reduce symptoms -- but this is in spite of the medication, not because of it. Of course, anti-depressants do help many people who are struggling with depression. However, the research points to the need for a greater understanding of the many factors that may contribute to the development of this common mental health disorder. HuffPost Science spoke to Andrews about why we may have gotten anti-depressants \"backwards\" -- and what the future of depression treatment might hold. Advertisement HuffPost: Where did the low-serotonin hypothesis originate? Andrews: The hypothesis didn't originate because anybody measured serotonin in depression or in any depressed-like state in an animal. It's really based on circumstantial evidence. Researchers back in the '40s and '50s happened to find that certain drugs that were trying to treat tuberculosis and schizophrenia had depression-relieving properties, and they wondered, why were they relieving depressive symptoms? They eventually figured out that the drugs increased serotonin in rodent models.... They reasoned that if these drugs relieved depressive symptoms in humans -- and, as best as we can tell, they increased serotonin -- then depression must be a state of low or reduced serotonin transmission. There have been problems with the low-serotonin hypothesis for a while. If you look to any serious neuroscientist, they'll all acknowledge that there are serious problems with it. It still is, nevertheless, the backbone of research on depression in neuroscience. What evidence is there to suggest that the low-serotonin hypothesis of depression may not be accurate? There is no way to be absolutely certain for two reasons. First, we cannot directly measure how fast serotonin is released, or transmitted. You can't do that even in a rat. You can measure the concentration of serotonin in a particular brain region, but you can't measure the transmission of it. The transmission would be to measure the release of the serotonin into the synapse. Advertisement The only thing we can measure is a marker of transmission, which reflects what happens to serotonin after it is released into the synapse and metabolized. Second, it is currently impossible to study this issue in humans without cutting holes in their skulls. But these studies can be done in animals. In these studies, there is abundant evidence that this marker of transmission is elevated. We reviewed 15 different models of depression that are used in neuroscience research that had measured this particular marker that we're concerned with. Of those 15 studies, 13 were consistent with the high-serotonin hypothesis, and the other two were not inconsistent with it. If you extrapolate to humans... that would strongly suggest that the evidence is in favor of the high-serotonin hypothesis of depression. OK, so how do anti-depressants work then? Another problem with the low serotonin hypothesis is that these drugs increase serotonin pretty rapidly, within minutes to hours. You'd think that if the low serotonin hypothesis was true, the anti-depressant drugs would work rapidly too. But they don't -- it takes three to four weeks for their symptom-reducing effects to kick on. So there's always been this disconnect between the onset of the pharmacological effects of the anti-depressants and their therapeutic effects. Advertisement So what's actually happening to depressive symptoms when you first start taking these drugs? Well, it's extremely common for people to start saying \"I feel worse\" rather than getting better. That's theoretically important because these drugs are working very quickly in terms of increasing serotonin. So what's happening to serotonin in the brain as those three or four weeks pass? It's falling.... As time goes on [after the initial peak], serotonin dips below the baseline and that's when you actually start feeling better. But things will eventually smooth out again and the brain will return to its steady state. That's what happens over prolonged anti-depressant use. Even when taking the drugs, people experience relapses. They might have that initial worsening of symptoms, then they'll feel better, and over prolonged period of use, they'll tell the doctor that the drugs aren't working anymore... And commonly the doctor will increase the dose or add on another drug. But the brain is always fighting these drugs and trying to bring itself back to its homeostatic equilibrium. Advertisement Antidepressants are known to cause many side effects. What are some of the most common? Limited efficacy at reducing depressive symptoms, sexual difficulties, difficulty concentrating, and problems with the digestive system are the most common. But many other types of problems can occur, including increased risk of relapse, a decrease in bone mineral density, abnormal bleeding, stroke, suicidal behaviour. Some of these problems can cause death -- several studies have shown that anti-depressants, especially in older people, are associated with an increased risk of death. You add them all up, and they all can be potentially serious things. What do you think is the future of depression treatment? As people and physicians become more aware that antidepressants only work for a limited period of time, and are less safe than they have been supposed, the use of antidepressant medications will decline and the use of psychotherapies will increase. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I would suggest that the attempt to pharmacologically reduce depressive symptoms is not likely to produce lasting effects. You can get these temporary effects, but they're not likely to be lasting effects, and they can cause a whole lot of problems. Advertisement Psychotherapy is more likely to produce lasting effects, and can help people cope with the things that actually triggered their depressive episodes, and that's why these therapies are more productive in the long run.

Australia Joins The Hunt For Aliens With A Huge Dish Telescope \"You won\u2019t find out unless you actually look.\u201d By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Nov 11, 2016, 08:09 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Artist\u2019s impression of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our solar system. The double star Alpha Centauri AB is also seen in the image between the planet and Proxima Centauri. The Australian Parkes Radio Telescope is scanning this area of space, looking for intelligent alien radio frequencies. ESOM Kornmesser Scientists in Australia are aiming a huge dish telescope at Proxima Centauri, one of our close solar neighbors, joining the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star a mere 4.25 light years from us, where an Earth-like planet \u2015 dubbed Proxima b \u2015 is believed in orbit. Proxima b may have temperatures that could allow liquid water to exist there, scientists speculate. Advertisement The next logical jump is speculation that Proxima b may be habitable. The Parkes Radio Telescope (pictured below) in New South Wales will lend a hand, er, dish to the mix, scanning for radio frequencies that might originate from unknown civilizations in space, reports the Aussie Network News . The radio telescope at Parkes, Australia, revolves at night during routine maintenance. \ufffd\ufffd Roger Ressmeyer/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images This is Australia\u2019s first collaboration with Breakthrough Listen , a 10-year, $100 million global effort to actively search for intelligent alien life, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization confirmed. Advertisement As reported by The New York Times , Breakthrough Listen was launched in 2015 by billionaire tech investor Yuri Milner. The project\u2019s international supporters include renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, astronomer Frank Drake, who founded California\u2019s SETI Institute (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), Cambridge University\u2019s Lord Martin Rees, and Ann Druyan, co-author of the \u201cCosmos\u201d television programs and widow of astronomer Carl Sagan. \u201cThe addition of Parkes is an important milestone,\u201d Milner told Australian media . \u201cThese major instruments are the ears of planet Earth, and now they are listening for signs of other civilizations.\u201d The video below is an artist\u2019s illustration, showing how the Parkes Radio Telescope \u201clooked\u201d through dust and gas of our Milky Way galaxy and found nearly 900 galaxies, \u201ca third of which had never been seen before,\u201d according to the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research. Advertisement Locating a verifiable intelligent alien radio signal is basically like looking for a cosmic needle in a haystack. But scientists believe Earth\u2019s most powerful telescopes are the best chance of helping to answer the question of whether earthlings are alone in the universe. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The cold spheres \u2015 stretching 11 miles along the coast \u2015 ranged in size from a tennis ball to nearly 3 feet across, according to The Siberian Times . \u201cWe were all very surprised,\u201d one local citizen told the paper. \u201cMany people believed it only when [they] saw with their own eyes. This has not happened previously. And there was not so much snow for them to form. It\u2019s so interesting.\u201d Advertisement A village administrator, Valery Akulov, offered a natural explanation to local media. \u201cWhen the water in the gulf rose, it came into contact with the frost. The beach began to be covered with ice. Then the water began to slowly retreat, and the ice remained. Its pieces were rolling over in the wet sand and turned into these balls,\u201d Akulov said. This map shows the location of the Siberian village of Nyda, where thousands of snowballs of varying sizes showed up. Google Maps The BBC reports the circular objects \u201cresult from a rare environmental process where small pieces of ice form, are rolled by wind and water, and end up as giant snowballs.\u201d Advertisement This oddity of nature has cropped up before. In 2010, floating ice spheres were seen near South Haven, Michigan, at the Great Lake: Three years later, more ice balls were spotted along the shore of Lake Michigan in 2013, and still again, in 2015, Lake Michigan was the target of many frozen circular boulders, as seen in the following video: 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LEAVE A COMMENT 27,000 birthday candles are lit to set a new Guinness record in New York, in 2005. Reuters By Adrienne LaFrance Emma Morano was 117 years old when she died in Italy last month. Toward the end of her long life, she held an auspicious, if lonely, place in human history. She is believed to have been the last person on Earth who was born in the 19th century: November 29, 1899. Barring planetary catastrophe, it will be some time before the last person who was born in the 20th century is gone. Advertisement RELATED: A Day With the Oldest Woman to Ever Live If someone born in 1999 lives to be 117, like Morano did, that person may live to see the year 2117. Or perhaps even the 2120s, if that person reaches 122 years old: That\u2019s still the record for longevity, held by Jeanne Calment, who was born in 1875 and died in 1997. We can\u2019t say for sure who holds the distinction of having been the last 18th-century baby on Earth, because there\u2019s no way to know for sure. Even when birth records were accurate, they didn\u2019t always survive. And lots of people make embellishments about their age in either direction. We do know, however, that one of the oldest people around in the early 1900s was Margaret Ann Neve, who was born near France in 1792, three months before the execution of Marie Antoinette. George Washington was the president of the United States at the time. \u201cEven when birth records were accurate, they didn\u2019t always survive.\u201d Advertisement Neve died a month before her 111th birthday, in the springtime of 1903. By then, she\u2019d achieved some degree of fame. She told reporters she distinctly remembered the \u201ctroubled times\u201d of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s leadership. During her honeymoon, she and her husband visited the field of Waterloo, where the famous battle had been waged just years before. There, according to newspaper accounts, she found a belt buckle from an Imperial Guard soldier. RELATED: Words of Wisdom From the World\u2019s Oldest Man \u201cShe is sweet faced, gentle, and fair, looking like a handsome old lady of 70,\u201d one newspaper reporter wrote in 1903. \u201cBrave old girls! Very aged women need no longer look like hideous mummies.\u201d Neve counted Queen Victoria of England among her friends, according to The New York Times account of Neve\u2019s death. \u201cMrs. Neve never misses sending on her Majesty\u2019s birthday a telegram of congratulation to Queen Victoria.\u201d Victoria, in turn, had a portrait of Neve displayed in the royal summer home. Advertisement Although 19th-century longevity researchers insisted there were records of people who lived to be 189 years old , and even 207 years old , our modern understanding of the human lifespan tells us that it\u2019s still unusual to make it past 100 \u2014 let alone to 117 or 122. RELATED: Warren Buffet Wants to be the Oldest Man Alive That hasn\u2019t stopped people from dreaming up ways to live longer \u2014 and who can blame us? \u2014 or plotting how to escape death entirely. But until we\u2019re able to upload our consciousness into machines or otherwise achieve immoraltity , humans are left swapping secrets on how to live longer. Centenarians always seem to have their tricks: fresh air , kindness , city strolls , sushi , cheese , sherry , pigs\u2019 ears , or in Emma Morano\u2019s case, raw eggs . Margaret Ann Neve had her own secret. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I was fortunate enough to be invited to a screening and press conference for the movie Chappie . It is a great movie about a police robot named Chappie that is downloaded with a program that makes him self-aware. At the press conference, Neill Blomkamp, the director, script writer, and the guy who came up with the idea for the movie, said he wasn't sure if humanity could ever produce the type of artificial intelligence (AI) in Chappie . I was curious if that was possible myself. In order to answer that question, I was able to interview the founder and director of the Visual and Autonomous Exploration Systems Research Laboratory at Caltech and at the University of Arizona, Dr. Wolfgang Fink. He is working on building an autonomous \" planetary field geologist\" robot for NASA. Advertisement Alejandro Rojas: How would you define an autonomous exploration system? Dr. Wolfgang Fink: A truly autonomous exploration system is not controlled at all by humans. It may be given a charter, for example, \"Go out there and explore a planet and then report back once you see something exciting.\" Humans always tell the robots what to do, so far, and that is the part where my lab tries to make a difference, so the robot or the system comes up with the decision where to go next and what to explore. Rojas: So, coming up with the decision, or the reasoning aspect, would you call that artificial intelligence? Fink: I would not, and that is very important. The term artificial intelligence refers to, over the last several decades, a largely rule based system, so called Mamdani type rules. What it means is if you encounter a certain type of situation, then react a certain way. If you encounter another situation, react another way. So if you have thousands of these rules in a system, then it looks like as if the system was intelligent looking from the outside in. However, the problem with such an approach is, while it is applicable and sufficient for certain tasks, especially tasks where we know everything that could happen, there are no surprises, but it doesn't lend itself to when there are surprises or a heavily changing dynamic environment. Advertisement In this case, with Chappie, for example, now you have a system that has been instilled with the capability of modifying itself, modifying its thinking and learning over time, and being influenced by its environment. Now that is the mark of an autonomous system, because at this point you cannot really predict anymore what trajectory or development the system will take in the future. Rojas: So, you are saying that Chappie is more along the lines of using autonomous reasoning rather than artificial intelligence. Fink: Yes. We have a nice comparison with the police robots, and Chappie was one of those. So the police robots, while they are highly automated, and many people would call them also autonomous, they are more governed by an artificial intelligence, because they have the law and order book internalized. They know if someone is wrongly parked, they give them a ticket, if someone pulls a gun, they pull a gun, and so they work according to certain schemes and a certain set of actions. Advertisement However, Chappie, in severe contrast to this, is not governed by the artificial intelligence rules. He is basically developing over time, being taught like a child. The culmination of which, at some point, he says, \"I am Chappie.\" That is a huge statement, because that means at that point he becomes self-aware. That is sort of the highest order and the true mark of an autonomous system. Rojas: Do you think self-awareness is possible? Fink: Yes, I believe it is possible, but not with the current AI approaches. It has to be vastly different than that. Rojas: Some people predict AI will exceed human capacity within 20 years. Do you think we are within that time frame, and should we worry about that? Advertisement Fink: It is a complex question. Let me try to break it down to some extent. There are systems which are faster than humans. They can go into places we cannot go, radiation environments, space, and so forth. That is all hardware. That can happen and happens already. There are systems that can calculate quicker than humans. That is a given too. We have systems that play chess better than humans, and that is only a number crunching exercise. Not to diminish those systems, but just to bring it down to the basics. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So, while that is impressive, it is not a threat to humanity. Where it becomes dicey is when you get a system which can move about and can take action, weaponized or not, and is able to react to its environment based on a non-deterministic algorithm. Meaning, it is not scripted. You cannot predict how the system is going to react. If you have such a system, which I think will be possible that it will happen in our lifetime, then, yes, it is something which is a threat to humanity. Especially, if you can't get control of it.

SpaceX Rocket Explodes Shortly After Liftoff SpaceX Rocket Explodes After Liftoff By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 28, 2015, 10:20 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An unmanned SpaceX rocket carrying supplies to the International Space Station erupted while in flight just a couple of minutes after a successful liftoff in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:21 a.m. EDT on Sunday. Pieces of the Falcon 9 rocket could be seen falling into the Atlantic, The Associated Press reported. NASA officials said that they have deployed vehicles to recover debris. Among the more than 4,000 pounds of payload in the rocket's Dragon cargo ship were important research equipment, student experiments that were lost in a previous Orbital rocket explosion, and a docking adapter, or parking place, for future commercial crew capsules. Advertisement About an hour after the accident, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed in a Twitter post that overpressurization in the rocket may have been related to the explosion. That's all we can say with confidence right now. Will have more to say following a thorough fault tree analysis. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 28, 2015 This isn't the first time that an attempt to ship cargo to the International Space Station has failed. In April, a Russian cargo ship malfunctioned on its way to resupply the station . Advertisement \u201cWe are disappointed in the loss of the latest SpaceX cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station. However, the astronauts are safe aboard the station and have sufficient supplies for the next several months,\" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement following the explosion . \"We will work with and support SpaceX to assess what happened, understand the specifics of the failure and correct it to move forward.\" He added that while the failed launch is a reminder of the challenges of spaceflight, it will not deter any future launches or plans for the agency's spaceflight program.

Why Send Humans To Space When We Can Send Robots? Why Send Humans To Space When We Can Send Robots? By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 27, 2015, 11:38 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT We live in an exciting era. For the first time in half a century, we are embroiled in another great space race. With each passing day our understanding of ourselves and our universe allows for massive innovations in the fields of science and technology, such as computers that are learning to program themselves or developing cures for medical scourges of humanity like cancer or AIDS. In the midst of these breakthroughs, it can be difficult to step back and approach such developments not only with a sense of wonder, but also with a critical eye. Perhaps the most crucial question of our times is: \u201cAt what cost?\u201d It\u2019s a question which despite its importance is nevertheless asked far too infrequently. Going to space is great, of course. But what does it mean for the future of humanity when the exploration of the final frontier is subject solely to the whims of corporations? Our scientific breakthroughs are undoubtedly astounding. But who is funding them and what are their motives?

Why Mars Can Be Affordable And Achievable Why Mars Can Be Affordable And Achievable By Joe Cassady, Contributor Executive Director for Space Programs, Washington Operations, Aerojet Rocketdyne Executive Director for Space Programs, Washington Operations, Aerojet Rocketdyne Nov 11, 2016, 10:17 AM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT The Delta IV Heavy rocket with the Orion spacecraft lifts off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida December 5, 2014. Scott Audette / Reuters Why should humans venture to Mars? In some sense, it is to fulfill a longing in our collective psyche. Humanity has dreamed of walking on Mars since travel above the Earth\u2019s surface became feasible... Those dreams seemed to be on the verge of being realized with the dawn of the Space Age in the mid-20 th Century, but for decades Mars remained out of reach to human explorers on site. That frustrating situation has resulted in what many have come to see as Mars being perpetually \u201c20 years away.\u201d In the terminology used for space launches, we have been in a \u201chold\u201d for the past 30 years. Today, however, we can finally say that the countdown clock is running. We are going to Mars, twenty years and counting! If we stay the course, the first humans will set foot on the Red Planet by the year 2033. New technologies have become available that have allowed us to take a fresh look at how to approach human Mars missions and, as a result, to tackle the hardest technical problems that had previously led to a hold in the countdown. And these approaches have given us the ability to design an architecture that can be brought on line incrementally, which keeps the annual expenditures within a reasonable projected NASA human spaceflight budget. Advertisement The key to this architecture is to separate much of the supplies and equipment and send them in advance of the crew. By prepositioning equipment, supplies, and even return rocket stages (more than 80 percent of the total mass), using propulsion systems such as solar electric propulsion (SEP) that are extremely energy efficient for long-haul cargo missions, we can save more than half the costs versus transporting everything using chemical propulsion systems that are needed to reach orbit. On the other hand, the Space Launch System (SLS) is the key to placing large blocks of payload into Earth orbit. An analogy here on Earth would be how intermodal shipping of supplies and manufactured goods is accomplished. Short haul is accomplished by trucks or rail, while long haul is accomplished by massive ships. In this same way, SLS accomplishes the short haul mission to orbit, whereas the cargo is transported over the much larger distance to Mars by solar electric transport ships. The two different propulsion systems, each of which is appropriate for its particular type of mission, are complementary. And to transport the astronauts, we add in a third element: the Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle as well as a deep-space habitat module, which together provide living space and life support systems. Advertisement Once all the elements arrive in Mars orbit, the final two pieces of the mission come into play. Improved entry, descent, and landing (EDL) approaches will safely and precisely land larger payloads on the surface. The largest payload elements, such as the surface habitat and the ascent vehicle to return the crew to Mars orbit, weigh 30 to 40 metric tons. Today we know how to land only one metric ton on Mars, so this is one of the challenges that still need to be overcome. However, NASA is already working on improved decelerators and other techniques such as supersonic retro propulsion. Such technologies need to be perfected within the next ten years, because the most massive payload elements will need about four years to be prepositioned. Once all of these are safely in Mars orbit, the crew can launch for the roughly seven-month transfer to Mars using cryogenic chemical propulsion stages to propel Orion and the deep space transit habitat. The power of this approach is that we can use in-space technologies that we already know work well and scale them up to accomplish the first Mars missions. Other technologies, such as on-orbit refueling or nuclear thermal propulsion, can be proven and incorporated later as they are matured. The ultimate goal of manufacturing propellant from space resources, however, requires several steps before we can utilize such methods. First, we must locate the resources and determine their abundance. Next, methods of extracting and processing the material must be developed. Then the process of manufacturing the desired propellant, such as oxygen and methane, in the quantities required must be proven in either deep space or on the planetary surface. Therefore, while in-situ propellant production is a very attractive ultimate goal, it does not make sense to place in the critical path for the first missions. Advertisement Mars is within our grasp. With a sustained program of risk reduction activities over the next 10 to 15 years, we will eliminate the knowledge gaps that still remain and we will build up an infrastructure that is capable of sustaining human missions of ever-increasing capability. As we mature approaches that improve upon this architecture, we will incorporate them into the overall structure. We need to take the first step that proves the possibility. Mars beckons us and we may be living now at the perfect time \u2013 a combination of technology readiness, public interest, and political will \u2013 to answer that call.

Doctors Change Teenage Burn Victim\u2019s Life With A 3D-Printed Nose The procedure is the first of its kind in the U.S. By Elyse Wanshel Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 31, 2015, 05:46 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Doctors have successfully implanted a 3D-printed nose onto a person for the first time in the U.S., according to New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital , which wrote about the surgery on its blog Monday. When Dallan Jennet was just 9 years old, he fell on a live power line near his home in the Marshall Islands that burned his entire face. Advertisement The accident left the boy with severe facial scarring and a hole for a nose. Dallan spent the next five years in self-imposed isolation. He even quit school because he didn\u2019t want anyone to stare at his face. That was until Dr. Tal Dagan, 44, the associate adjunct surgeon at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai , heard about Dallan's case during an August 2014 trip to the Marshall Islands organized by Canvasback Missions , a nonprofit that brings health care and education to the Pacific Islands. Dagan was intrigued by the boy\u2019s case. Once he finally met Dallan, he knew he had to build him a new nose. Advertisement \u201cHe was depressed, just sitting there on a rock and staring at the ground,\u201d Dagan told The New York Daily News last month. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to look up at me.\u201d In June, after a preliminary surgery to expand the remaining skin around where his nose used to be, Dallan arrived in New York City, where Dagan and a team from Oxford Performance Materials created a 3D-printed facial device that would look and function like a real nose. In order to create a natural-looking nose, the team used sample models based on the noses of Dallan's family members. According to the New York Daily News , they then used donor cartilage to build a nose that resembled the family models and used tissue from the teen\u2019s forehead to create the outside of the nose. Advertisement \"This is complete science fiction,\" Dagan told CBS last month. \"You're getting a completely new type of technology.\u201d Dallan's procedure went so well that doctors reportedly hope to use the same technique on soldiers returning from war who need facial reconstruction surgery. Meanwhile, Dallan, now 15, already seems to be thriving. \"I like to smell everything,\" he told CBS , adding that his favorite thing to smell is pepperoni pizza. Advertisement He's finally ready to go back to school, Dagan told the Daily News , and \u201che even has a girlfriend.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Scientists Want Your Help To Locate 'Spiders' On Mars You can be part of the search for strange Martian surface features from the comfort of your home. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Oct 27, 2016, 06:56 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The image shows spidery channels eroded into the Martian ground. It's an example from high resolution observation of more than 20 places that were chosen in 2016 on the basis of about 10,000 volunteers' examination of lower resolution images of large areas near Mars' south pole. NASAJPLCaltechUniv of Arizona None of the itsy-bitsy spidery things in the image above are tiny, nor are they on Earth. Those creepy-crawlers are surface features on Mars, which have been photographed near the south pole of the red planet for years by the HiRISE camera onboard NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , or MRO. The area in the picture measures about half-a-mile wide. In an attempt to learn more about these odd-looking features, planetary scientists have created a website, Planet Four: Terrains , and are looking for volunteers to assist them in finding more spider locations on Mars. Advertisement According to a Planet Four: Terrains statement: The exotic terrains of Mars\u2019 south pole have many forms unlike anything on Earth. We would like your help to map where they occur in images taken by the Context Camera aboard the MRO. We will use the locations you identify as targets for detailed study with the HiRISE camera, the highest resolution camera ever sent to a planet! So far, 10,000 volunteers have helped Planet Four: Terrains researchers to identify more than 20 areas on Mars that result in spring and early summer seasonal changes that form the spidery terrain called araneiform (the Latin word for spiders). Advertisement Using their home computers, these \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d explore the Martian surface, looking at images posted on the Planet Four: Terrains site and describe what they see in the pictures to help scientists zero in on new regions to investigate. These spider-like surface features -- called araneiform terrain -- are on Mars\u2019 south polar region. Scientists believe the naturally-forming cracks result from the spring season as warm temperatures thaw subsurface CO2 ice. NASAJPLUniv of Arizona \u201cIt\u2019s heartwarming to see so many citizens of planet Earth donate their time to help study Mars,\u201d said Candice Hansen, HiRISE deputy principal investigator at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona. Advertisement \u201cThanks to the discovery power of so many people, we\u2019re using HiRISE to take images of places we might not have studied without this assistance,\u201d Hansen said in a statement. The Planet Four: Terrains science team believes humans are better than computers in locating new spider formations on Mars, according to their site: Identifying these different terrains is a task that computers are not good at. It turns out that people are really good at this task. Human beings can easily match patterns and identify outliers that can be difficult if not impossible to teach machines to do. By having multiple people independently assess each image, we gain the wisdom of the crowd. It has been shown that the combined assessment of many non-experts can often equal and outperform those of experts and machine-learning algorithms. Hansen added how important it\u2019s been having private citizens uncovering new spider regions on Mars. \u201cWe have new findings and new questions to answer, thanks to all the help from volunteers.\u201d Another image from Mars\u2019 south polar region showing spider shapes that may have been formed by frozen carbon dioxide.

How to Be a Hero: Insight From the Milgram Experiment This unilateral focus on the dark side has had the unintended effect of blinding us to one of the most obvious and inspiring features of the experiment: it also showed that hundreds of ordinary people -- though the minority of Milgram's participants -- did in fact have what it takes to stand up for what is right.

You know, the 1960s psychologist who discovered that hundreds of ordinary Americans could be directed to deliver apparently excruciating electroshocks to another ordinary volunteer, simply on the say-so of a scientist in a gray lab coat. In a series of two dozen studies lasting almost a year, Milgram systematically explored how, by making changes to the social situation -- the proximity of the shocker to the man being shocked, the presence of two scientists contradicting each other, the role of the shocker in a chain of command, et cetera -- he could cause rates of obedience to rise or plummet at will. The Milgram Obedience Experiment soon became world-famous as one of the most controversial psychological experiments of all time. The controversy has not ended, and experts today are still hashing out what, if anything, Milgram demonstrated about the dark side of human nature: our putative propensity to blindly acquiesce to authority-directed courses of action, no matter how immoral. To what extent can social psychological findings in a Yale lab illuminate the darkest episodes of modern history, from the factory-style murder of millions of civilians in the Holocaust, to the Soviet gulag prison-camp system, the Vietnam-era My Lai massacre of hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese villagers by American soldiers and the suicide missions of the 9/11 terrorists and subsequent CIA torture tactics used on terror suspects? Although it makes a lot of sense to spotlight conformity to the scientist's directives to continue delivering the shocks, this unilateral focus on the dark side has had the unintended effect of blinding us to one of the most obvious and inspiring features of the experiment: it also showed that hundreds of ordinary people -- though the minority of Milgram's participants -- did in fact have what it takes to stand up for what is right. Roughly one-third of the research subjects emerged from the situational crucible as heroes, armed with an uncommon competence at resisting immoral authority. Although it is statistically unlikely that you or I would emerge from one of the high-obedience versions of the experiment as a hero, we all naturally imagine that, had we participated, we would have been in the \"defiant\" group whose members successfully disobeyed the scientist. Advertisement What was it exactly about these people that enabled them to succeed where so many others had failed? If Milgram's scenario dramatically allowed the dark side of human nature to show itself, how had these several hundred men and women struggled against it and won? Previous research on the experiment has shown that psychological and sociological factors like personality, education, income, gender and religious affiliation are not clearly associated with either of the two outcomes. This means that, as Milgram and others argued, obedience must be understood primarily in terms of the social situation of the experiment itself rather than in terms of demographic variables. Successful resistance, the flip side of obedience, thus ought to be studied as something that some participants, but not others, were doing in their interactions with the authority figure. Rather than speculate, I wanted to discover these actions in their natural environment of detailed and organized social interaction. With support from the National Science Foundation, I obtained copies of 117 of Milgram's original recordings from the Yale library where they are archived, and hired undergraduates at my university to start the labor-intensive process of transcribing them. I then edited the rough transcripts to accurately capture the details of how, in interaction with the scientist and the man receiving shocks, participants had actually behaved as they familiarized themselves with what the scientist wanted them to do, gradually became aware that the man was being shocked against his will and reacted in real time to the developing situation. My findings, recently published in The British Journal of Social Psychology , can be summarized as follows. Resistance in the Milgram Experiment is highly structured, both sequentially and typologically. By \"sequentially,\" I mean that participants found themselves in a situational dilemma. They were caught in the middle of two competing proposals for what they should do next: the scientist was directing them to continue, whereas the man being shocked was complaining and demanding to be released. This social environment of mutually opposed interactional sequences is the context in which participants initiated, and sometimes sustained, their resistance. Resistance is also \"typologically\" organized: I found a small number of forms (six) that appear again and again. These can be arrayed along a continuum of explicitness, since some ways of resisting -- like remaining silent and inactive when directed to continue -- are relatively passive, whereas other ways -- like trying to stop the experiment by saying, \"I don't want to do this anymore\" -- are stronger, often showing the participants treating themselves as having more say-so than the scientist. The three weaker strategies that merely postpone continuation are: Advertisement (1)Remaining silent, or hesitating (\"Um...\") (2)Displaying how much effort it would take to continue (groaning, sighing) (3)Laughing The three more assertive strategies that actively propose discontinuation are: (4)Speaking to the man being shocked (e.g., proposing that he decide whether or not to continue) (5)Prompting the authority figure to provide a remedy (e.g., reporting to him something about the situation that makes continuation problematic) (6)Announcing one's inability or unwillingness to continue (\"I can't/won't do this anymore\") Counterintuitively, both the \"obedient\" and \"defiant\" groups of participants used the same six resistance techniques. However, the groups radically differed in how, and how often, they used them. For instance, virtually all of the defiant participants escalated the strength of their developing resistance to the most explicit type, number 6, often using it multiple times. By contrast, only one in five of the obedient ones were so assertive, and only a handful used it more than once. Advertisement From this and other research, it's possible to summarize what makes attempted resistance successful in the Milgram scenario: (1) Diversifying the Techniques. Rather than relying on a single strategy to counter the authority figure, defiant participants were able to use several. For example, they would justify their refusal to continue by invoking the Golden Rule and wondering what it would be like to be in the victim's shoes. Or they would treat the victim, rather than the authority, as having the right to decide whether or not to continue. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Rather than allowing the problematic situation to become deeply entrenched, they began resisting relatively early in the experiment. Advertisement (3) Sustaining Resistance. Rather than backing down when their resistance was countered by the authority, they sustained it by trying an alternative resistance strategy. And another and another, until the authority himself backed down. It appears, then, that a crucial ingredient in heroism has been overlooked. In addition to what individual native courage and decisiveness contribute, Milgramesque heroes have expertise at a discrete set of rhetorical skills for effectively coping with an unethical course of action directed by an authority. Moreover, this is a skill set that, once clearly identified, is easily teachable for purposes of empowering victims or potential victims of toxic authority-subordinate relationships. Real-world situations with Milgramesque relevance may include not only the notorious political and military atrocities mentioned above, but also more commonplace events. The above findings could be usefully applied to a variety of areas of daily living such as bullying in the workplace or school, airplane crashes due to faulty pilot-copilot or pilot-tower communication, white-collar crime in business, military or government settings where \"whistleblowing\" is relevant and more. Advertisement In sum, what distinguishes Milgram's heroes from the rest of us is largely a teachable competency at resisting questionable authority. As with any other skill set, much (though not all) of what it takes to be a hero is effective instruction and practice.

Humans Actually Did Some Good Stuff For The Planet In 2015 All is not lost ... yet. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 29, 2015, 08:50 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Rick Loomis/Getty Images This year was a big one for the planet, and world leaders are finally listening to scientists who say all is not well in the world. But while some things look dire, we've made progress in 2015. The planet has banded together to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Threatened habitats have been protected, and most of us cite environmental protection as one of the biggest issues of our time. Advertisement While there's still work to do, here are five things that would've made Captain Planet proud this year. Let's hope the Republican presidential candidates take note . The world approved a landmark climate deal After more than a decade of misfires, the world finally reached a sweeping climate deal in an effort to halt the worst of greenhouse gas-induced warming. The leaders of more than a hundred nations were present in Paris for the landmark talks, which United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called \"a historic moment ... [for] one of the most crucial problems on earth.\" The pact itself will encourage nations, especially the biggest carbon emitters like the U.S., China and India, to move away from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy. By itself, it won't keep the planet from crossing the warming threshold scientists say we must stay beneath to avoid the worst climate-related effects . But the deal represents what President Barack Obama called \" the best chance we have to save the one planet that we've got.\" Advertisement Obama established the planet's biggest marine sanctuary In September, Obama created the world's largest protected marine reserve in the Pacific Ocean. The act expanded the Pacific Remote Islands National Marine Monument to nearly half a million square miles. The move represented a significant shift in environmental policy in the U.S., where more than 10 percent of land is protected, but less than 1 percent of the ocean is. Most of us care about climate change (except Americans) Most of the world now realizes climate change is one of the most trying problems of our age. A full 54 percent of nations identify the issue as a \" very serious problem ,\" according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, while 85 percent say it's at least a \"somewhat\" serious issue. Advertisement Unfortunately, that concern doesn't spread to America, one of last bastions of climate denialism worldwide. The U.S. is largely unconcerned with the issue despite near-universal calls for action from the planet's leading scientists, and more than one in three people said they were either not too worried or not worried at all about the issue. Renewable energy fueled more than ever Several major renewable energy milestones were set in 2015 as cities and entire countries announced plans to fuel their entire grids with clean power. Germany set a new national record as a full 78 percent of the country's power was met through renewable sources during one day in July. The governor of New York announced the city's intentions to fuel half of all power in America's largest metropolis with clean energy, and San Diego said it would be entirely renewable in just 20 years. Advertisement The largest polluter announced a cap-and-trade program During Chinese president Xi Jinping's visit to the United States, the leader of the world's biggest carbon emitter announced China would launch a national emissions trading program in 2017. For years, Republicans had pointed to China's lack of action on climate change -- namely, because of fears it would squelch business -- as a prime reason why the U.S. should be hesitant to take action too. Xi's announcement came just ahead of the Paris climate talks and represented a massive, focused commitment to tackle the issue by a nation as reliant on coal as America is on oil.

'Egg Rock' Meteorite Discovered On Mars By Curiosity Rover The space rock was located in a region where conditions once favored life. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Nov 4, 2016, 09:18 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This image, photographed by NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars Rover on Oct. 30, 2016, shows a dark, smooth-surfaced object. After the golf ball-sized object was examined by laser pulses from Curiosity, it was determined to be an iron-nickel meteorite. The object has been nicknamed \u201dEgg Rock\u201d after an historic area of Bar Harbor, Maine. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Don\u2019t be fooled by the dark object in the image above. It\u2019s about the size of a golf ball, but appears bigger in the picture. It was discovered on the surface of the red planet Mars and photographed on Oct. 30 by NASA\u2019s hardworking Curiosity rover . Last month, Curiosity reached an area on Mars called Mount Sharp, where it found the shiny, smooth-surfaced object. The rover used a laser device to examine the unusual item and determined it was an iron-nickel meteorite. Scientists named it \u201cEgg Rock,\u201d after the historic Egg Rock area of Bar Harbor, Maine. Advertisement The five bright spots that can be seen on the space rock in the close-up image below were the result of Curiousity\u2019s laser. This close-up of the Martian meteorite discovered by the Curiosity rover shows several bright circular marks, the result of the space rock being zapped by the rover's laser equipment. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Curiosity made the video panorama below at its landing site in 2012, inside Gale Crater. It shows Mount Sharp, where the rover discovered the meteorite. Advertisement \u201cIron-nickel meteorites are a common class of space rocks found on Earth, and previous examples have been found on Mars, but Egg Rock is the first on Mars to be examined with a laser-firing spectrometer,\u201d the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a statement . Curiosity was launched from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral in 2011 and landed in Gale Crater in 2012. \u201cEgg Rock was found along the rover\u2019s path up a layer of lower Mount Sharp, where sedimentary rocks hold records of ancient lakebed environments on Mars,\u201d the JPL statement continued . \u201cThe main science goal for Curiosity\u2019s second extended mission, which began last month, is to investigate how ancient environmental conditions changed over time. Advertisement \u201cThe mission has already determined that this region once offered conditions favorable for microbial life, if any life ever existed on Mars.\u201d Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

NASA: Space Weather And Radiation Bubble Are Linked To Human Activity Cold War high-altitude nuclear explosions resulted in extra radiation close to Earth. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost May 19, 2017, 10:16 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This is an illustration of layers of radiation belts close to Earth that were produced as a result of Cold War high-altitude nuclear explosion tests. NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center The ongoing movement by scientists and activists to pressure political officials to address global warming and climate change has been growing in recent years. But there\u2019s another earthling-influenced phenomenon we don\u2019t hear too much about: how we affect what happens in space. According to NASA : Space weather \u2015 which can include changes in Earth\u2019s magnetic environment \u2015 are usually triggered by the sun\u2019s activity, but recently declassified data on high-altitude nuclear explosion tests have provided a new look at the mechanisms that set off perturbations in that magnetic system. Earth is surrounded by layers of radiation belts, and as the space agency says in the following video, the Cold War-era experiments of the 1950s and \u201860s produced extra radiation close to Earth. While those military tests concluded long ago, the after-effects of such actions, now called human-induced space weather, are the focus of a new study published in Space Science Reviews , which offers research access to millions of scientific documents. Advertisement As reported in The Scientific Foundation of Space Weather : These explosions created artificial radiation belts near Earth that resulted in major damages to several satellites. Another unexpected impact of the high-altitude nuclear tests was the electromagnetic pulse that can have devastating effects over a large geographic area (such as the continental United States). Other anthropogenic impacts on the space environment include chemical release experiments, high-frequency wave heating of the ionosphere and the interaction of VLF waves with the radiation belts. Certain types of communications \u2015 very low frequency, or VLF, radio communications \u2015 have been found to interact with particles in space, affecting how and where they move. At times, these interactions can create a barrier around Earth against natural high-energy particle radiation in space. The following video depicts this barrier or bubble around our planet, which, according to NASA, was created by those VLF waves. Advertisement \u201cA number of experiments and observations have figured out that, under the right conditions, radio communications signals in the VLF frequency range can, in fact, affect the properties of the high-energy radiation environment around the Earth,\u201d Phil Ericson, assistant director at the MIT Haystack Observatory in Massachusetts, said in a NASA statement . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The space agency added that while these VLF signals are used to communicate with submarines, \u201cthey also extend out beyond our atmosphere, shrouding Earth in a VLF bubble\u201d that even \u201cspacecraft high above Earth\u2019s surface\u201d can see.

SeaWorld Sues California Authorities Over Orca Breeding Ban SeaWorld claims the ban would effectively end its popular killer whale shows. Marty Graham Dec 30, 2015, 02:36 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT SAN DIEGO, Dec 29 (Reuters) - SeaWorld sued California authorities on Tuesday, seeking to overturn a decision that allows the San Diego theme park to expand its orca habitat only if it stops breeding killer whales in captivity. The lawsuit, filed in San Diego Superior Court, argues that the California Coastal Commission overstepped its authority when it imposed the breeding restriction because it does not have jurisdiction over the marine mammals, which are regulated under federal law. Advertisement The commission, which oversees development along California's coast, only had jurisdiction to approve or reject construction projects at the park and would effectively end SeaWorld's popular killer whale shows, the complaint said. \"The condition forces SeaWorld to either agree to the eventual demise of its lawful and federally regulated orca exhibition, or withdraw the permit application and forego the effort to enhance the orcas' habitat,\" SeaWorld Entertainment Inc attorneys said. The lawsuit claims the California Coastal Commission overstepped its authority when it imposed a restriction on breeding killer whales. Credit: Wolfgang Kaehler via Getty Images Advertisement During a contentious seven-hour hearing in October, the California Coastal Commission voted unanimously to give SeaWorld permission to double the size of its orca pools so long as the park ends its captive breeding program and does not transfer any of its marine mammals to other facilities. Critics who attended the hearing questioned SeaWorld's treatment of animals in captivity and demanded the park's population of 11 orcas be released into the wild. \"The Coastal Commission process became unhinged,\" the complaint states. \"Animal rights activists appeared at the Coastal Commission hearing and vilified SeaWorld in their 'testimony,'\" the lawsuit contends. Advertisement Officials at the commission did not immediately return calls for comment about the lawsuit. Eight of SeaWorld's 11 orcas are the result of captive breeding, the lawsuit said. \"SeaWorld has not collected an orca from the wild in more than 35 years and has committed to not doing so in the future,\" attorneys said. The complaint asks the Superior Court judge to either order the the restrictions be removed or order a new hearing of the development proposal, called \"Blue World,\" without the restrictions on breeding and transfer, and for the cost of SeaWorld's attorney fees. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Pixabay Not every lad can eat four dozen eggs every morning to help him get large , but it turns out just one might do the trick. If you\u2019re a baby, anyway. We may be lucky enough not to think about it in much of the United States, but worldwide there are tens of millions of children with stunted growth. Most of those kids are impoverished and often live in areas where access to nutritious food is limited. The World Health Organization has tried to ameliorate this problem by supplying fortified food products to underserved areas. The trouble is that those products are fairly expensive \u2014 potentially too expensive for poor families to afford \u2014 and distribution may not even reach more remote areas of the world. That\u2019s where eggs come in. Advertisement Eggs are cheap. They\u2019re relatively easy to come by in many low-income areas, because people in those parts of the world often raise chickens and other poultry. They\u2019re also high in protein , vitamin B12, riboflavin, and choline, plus they have significant amounts of a ton of other vitamins and minerals. And for a little baby, they can offer over 50 percent of critical daily nutrients. Eggs are an incredible, edible supplement to an impoverished kid\u2019s diet. So a team of public health researchers from all over the U.S. and Ecuador decided to see just how much of an impact an egg a day could have. They published their results on Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics . The group traveled to a poor province in Ecuador, gathered up mother-infant pairs, and split them into two groups. One group gave their babies (aged six to nine months) an egg each day, while the other group gave no eggs. Researchers showed up at their houses to provide the eggs every week and used that visit to gather information about how the babies were doing. They took their weight and height, plus asked about any other medical problems the infants might be having. At the end of six months, they found the kids who ate eggs were significantly taller and larger. An eggy diet appeared to reduce stunting by 47 percent, and babies fed on the incredible edibles were 74 percent less likely to be underweight. Advertisement \u201cEggs could even help populations with high obesity rates, since they\u2019re a well-balanced food.\u201d Eggs could even help populations with high obesity rates, since they\u2019re a well-balanced food. If populations who currently eat food high in calories but low in nutrients ate more eggs, they\u2019d probably be healthier overall. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The researchers funded a public health awareness campaign to inform the local population about the potential benefits of eating eggs. Tactics like that could be even more helpful in places where eggs aren\u2019t already a common food. Cool Hand Luke is the only man who can eat 50 eggs in an hour, but if every baby could eat 50 eggs in about two months we could genuinely improve the lives of our most undernourished populations.

The Big Rip , the Big Crunch , the Big Freeze , it pretty much sounds like a list of 'big' Hollywood B-movies. Funny as they may sound, these are some of the most fundamental theories for the beginning and the ending of the Universe. Viscosity, that sticky, gooey consistency of things, could actually hold the key for astrophysics to determine how it will all end billions of years into the future. The Big Freeze, for example, considers that all available material in the Universe used to form new stars will have been used up; existing stars would eventually burn out. Being the main producers of thermal energy, the cosmic eternity would then suffer from the cold vastness of space. Black holes, those enigmatic consumers of everything that crosses their path, will eventually evaporate -through a process called Hawking (yes, Stephen Hawking) radiation- as space becomes a cold living ground. Advertisement The Big Crunch, mostly discarded by modern physics, suggests that the gravitational pull of the mass present in the Universe will bring back everything together again; probably imploding and creating a new Big Bang, and therefore a new Universe into life (Figure 1). We currently know that the amount of gravitational pull required for this to happen is not present in our Universe. Figure 1. How the Big Crunch works. [Credit: howstuffworks.com ] Since the decade of the 1990s, astronomers discovered that the Universe is infinitely expanding in an accelerated manner (Figure 2), so everything (including atoms) will eventually \"rip apart\", giving the emerging Big Rip theory its curious name. This undeniable accelerated expansion requires that a little over 68% of all the ingredients that make the Universe is an exotic thing called \"dark energy\". We know it permeates space, and that we need it to exist in that percentage to create the observed acceleration. What it is made of, is a matter of ongoing debate and one of the pillars of modern cosmology. It could be underlying constant energy filling space or energy varying with space and time. Figure 2. Expansion of the Universe since the Big Bang [Credit: NASA/WISE] It is possible, but not very likely, that viscosity could account for all the acceleration that has been attributed to dark energy,\" said Disconzi in a news bulleting by Vanderbilt University . \"It is more likely that a significant fraction of the acceleration could be due to this more prosaic cause. As a result, viscosity may act as an important constraint on the properties of dark energy.\" Advertisement Previous equations and theories suggested that viscosity would prevent the Universe from \"ripping\" apart. The new formulation by Desconzi-Kephart-Shcerrer provides a plausible way for viscosity to allow structures to just pull apart after a certain threshold is reached. \"In previous models with viscosity the Big Rip was not possible,\" said Scherrer in the bulletin. \"In this new model, viscosity actually drives the Universe toward this extreme end state.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Sara Chodosh These people already have perfectly chilled beer. Why don't you? Unsplash You always forget to chill the booze. Somehow the burgers get prepped and the decorations get hung, but fifteen minutes before the cookout begins, you\u2019re stuck with lukewarm beer . Well, not anymore. Because if there\u2019s one thing science can help us with, it\u2019s thermodynamics. And that\u2019s really all this problem is\u2014how do you lower the temperature of a liquid inside a metal can (or glass bottle) as quickly as possible? Advertisement The salt water method This is the most basic and practical way to cool drinks, because virtually everyone has the materials to do it. The process is simple: Fill a container (something insulted like a cooler is best) with ice, water , and lots of salt. You really can\u2019t overdo it on the salt here, but you can overdo it on ice. Make sure to add enough water to surround the drinks, since that gives you the maximal surface area to cool the beer inside. Submerge your cans and/or bottles as much as possible. Make sure that they aren\u2019t packed too tightly, since you want the icy water to flow around each container. If you\u2019ve put the drinks in a cooler with a top, close the top. Wait. This should only take about five minutes. That\u2019s it! Enjoy your chilled beer. Why salt water works so well Plain water freezes at 32\u00b0F. Salt water can get much colder than that and still remain a liquid. You might remember this from your high school chemistry class \u2014 it\u2019s called \u201cfreezing point depression,\u201d and it happens because dissolving salt in water lowers the liquid\u2019s freezing point. Table salt breaks down into sodium and chloride ions, which physically interfere with water molecules\u2019 ability to form the crystalline structure we call ice. This means the solution has to be colder than normal in order to freeze. Advertisement Incidentally, salt in water will also raise the boiling point, leading to the old wives\u2019 tale that you shouldn\u2019t add salt to water if you\u2019re trying to boil it. While it\u2019s technically true, the amount of salt you add when cooking won\u2019t raise the boiling point by any substantial amount, so salt away. Now, back to beer chilling. If you put your beer in an ice-water bath, it will cool the beer fairly effectively because liquid conducts heat well: The icy water pulls heat from the beer; the beers gets cooler. But no matter how much ice you add to a standard water bath, it will only ever reach temperatures just above 32\u00b0F. If it got any colder than that, you\u2019d just end up with more ice. Even if you keep your ice at 0\u00b0F, the standard temperature for freezers, once it melts into ice water, the liquid won\u2019t get any colder than that 32\u00b0F sticking point. So what happens when you add salt to the bath? Because salt lowers the melting point of water, if you add salt to ice, the ice will melt. You might assume that, because the ice is melting faster, the salt has somehow heated up the ice faster than normal. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening\u2014the salt isn\u2019t raising the temperature of the ice; it\u2019s converting ice into salt water of the same temperature. Advertisement Salty ice water can get much colder than regular water, though. While salty 0\u00b0F ice will still melt, its temperature won\u2019t increase to 32\u00b0F like it would in regular water. Instead, the salt will turn it into 0\u00b0F water. Combined with the rest of the water in the bath, you suddenly have a watery, salty slurry that\u2019s well below 32\u00b0F. And because the water bath is colder, your beer will chill faster. But what if you spin the bottles? In case five minutes is too long to wait, there is one more thing you can do to speed the cooling process along: Spin it! (Pull it! Bop it!) Water is already a great heat conductor, but it still takes time for heat to transfer from the beverage inside the bottle or can to the bath outside it. Inside the container, the beer along the edges will be slightly colder than the fluid at the center. Likewise, on the outside of the container, the water closest to the beverage will be slightly warmer. You can alleviate some of that unevenness by spinning the bottles (gently, so as not to shake them up). This will speed up the heat redistribution from beer to water. Advertisement One company seems to sell a device explicitly for this purpose , though if you haven\u2019t thought to chill your beer yet, it\u2019s unlikely that you thought to buy a special gadget to do so. In a pinch, you could rig up a spinning device from a can of compressed air . Or hook up a bottle to a power drill\u2014just remember to remove the drill bit so you don\u2019t put a hole through the can. Alternatively, just wait the five minutes for the salt bath to work. It\u2019s not worth interrupting your celebration for a trip to the emergency room. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LEAVE A COMMENT By Kendra Pierre-Louis Whether your blood sugar spikes after eating whole wheat or white bread depends on the microbes in your gut. Pexels Whether your blood sugar spikes after eating whole wheat or white bread depends on the microbes in your gut. \u201cOne of the reasons we focused on bread is that it\u2019s one of the most heavily consumed foods worldwide,\u201d says study author Eran Elinav, an immunology researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science. \u201cIt amounts to somewhere between 10 percent to 40 percent of our daily caloric content. And as such there are many myths about good bread and bad bread. A whole culture has developed around it, but when you look in the [scientific] literature there\u2019s really very little proof.\u201d Advertisement Along with Elinav, researchers at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and Tel Aviv University spent two weeks feeding 20 study participants 6 meals of bread a day. In the first week, 10 participants received 3 meals a day of white bread along with 3 meals a day of white bread plus butter. An additional 10 participants were fed the same pattern of meals, but instead of white bread they got whole wheat sourdough bread. This was followed by a two-week washout period, so the participants could reset their guts, followed by a week where they flipped roles. Those who\u2019d been giving a week of white bread were given a week of whole wheat sourdough, and those who had spent a week imbibing on sourdough switched to white. Throughout the two weeks of bread eating, the researchers measured the participants\u2019 glycemic responses. Glycemic response is a measure of how the body\u2019s blood sugar responds after we eat a meal. While all foods cause some increase in blood sugar, some foods can cause our blood sugar to spike to unhealthy levels, while others cause a more modest increase. In general, a high glycemic response is considered bad because it\u2019s linked to the development of insulin resistance \u2014 a precursor to Type II diabetes . Diabetes, apart from being a problematic disease in its own right, is also linked to the development of heart disease and stroke. In general, it\u2019s assumed that highly processed and refined foods, like white bread, cause a higher glycemic response than less processed whole wheat breads. Advertisement But when Elinav\u2019s team looked at the data in aggregate, that isn\u2019t what they found. Neither bread was better than the other \u2014 both elicited a similar glycemic response, when you averaged out the entire study group. A closer look at the data revealed something curious, however: the data sets were showing different glycemic responses for different breads, but they were cancelling each other out. \u201cWe discovered that roughly half the people in our study who consumed an industrialized white bread that you can purchase at your local supermarket had a favorable response to that bread as compared to our very fancy whole wheat sourdough bread, which was made in the best bakery in Tel Aviv,\u201d says Elinav. \u201cThe other half of people featured an exact opposite response.\u201d In other words, from the perspective of blood sugar, there isn\u2019t an inherently good bread or bad bread. Rather, there\u2019s a bread that\u2019s good for you , and that same exact bread might be bad for your friend. What\u2019s healthy, it turns out, depends on the person . Advertisement \u201cWhat\u2019s healthy, it turns out, depends on the person.\u201d One size fits all nutrition may be a thing of the past. Pexels Perhaps most intriguingly, Elinav and his team found that they could predict which type of bread would most likely trigger a high insulin reaction for each participant based on samples of their gut microbiomes . Advertisement Our bodies play host to a broad community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that help to make us who we are. Although we tend to think of microbes as being harmful, these microbes play a crucial role in maintaining our health and wellbeing. Though research on the subject is still very much at its early stage, the microbes in our gut (which encompasses the full length of our digestive tract, including stomach and intestines), play a crucial role in digestion, obesity, and perhaps even in maintaining our mood. In an earlier study , Elinav and his team were able to create an algorithm that would predict how a person would respond to food \u2014 that is, whether or not it would trigger a high or low glycemic response \u2014 based on the person\u2019s lifestyle, medical background, and the composition and function of their microbiome. By taking microbiome samples of participants in this study and plugging them into the algorithm, Elinav and his colleagues were able to determine that the algorithm matched the data. Based just on the data they plugged in, they could predict who would fare better eating white bread, versus eating the whole wheat sourdough bread. Before you start chowing down on white bread by the bagful, it\u2019s important to note that there are some limits to the study. For starters, the sample size was small, though its experimental (rather than observational) design does work in its favor. But Elinav was mostly focused on glycemic response, not overall nutrition. Industrialized bread has a bad reputation for more than just the potential glycemic response: it\u2019s also lower in nutrients . Whole wheat breads tend to have more fiber and vitamins, including magnesium, zinc, and folic acid. A lot of the patients Elinav studies tend to have diabetes or pre-diabetes, so focusing on health risks related to blood sugar made sense. But for most of us, there are other things to consider at mealtime. Advertisement Additionally, the study doesn\u2019t explain the differences in the participants\u2019 microbiomes, or the mechanisms by which these differences came about \u2014 or how they might help or hurt bread digestion. It only acknowledges that there is some difference between the microbes in a wheat-loving body and one that does better on white bread. In other words, like most nutrition studies, this shouldn\u2019t change what\u2019s on your plate . Don\u2019t move away from a diet of whole foods to one of more processed foods. What the study does suggest, however, is that if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic and notice that certain nutrient-rich foods causes your sugar levels to spike, you might be better off avoiding them and finding other, also nutrient-rich foods that don\u2019t send your sugar levels soaring. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

But as exciting as this research is, we\u2019re not there yet. Advertisement One of the things Elinav\u2019s team is doing is taking people with pre-diabetes \u2014 that is, people who don\u2019t have diabetes yet but have many of the precursor signs \u2014 and trying to personalize their diet, tweaking their nutrition in a way intended to prevent them from getting diabetes. But that research is still in progress. \u201cI think this new approach, this new paradigm or way of thinking about nutrition, really flips the nutritional world on its head,\u201d says Elinav. \u201cIt opens up some really big and exciting questions.\u201d This article originally appeared on Popular Science .

Stem Cells From Wisdom Teeth Seen As Possible Fix For This Common Form Of Blindness Patient's Teeth Could Be Fix For Common Cause Of Blindness By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 26, 2015, 09:02 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Macro shot of bright blue human eye Scientists have taken a key step toward the development of what could be a breakthrough treatment for corneal blindness , a condition that affects millions of people around the world. The scientists showed that stem cells obtained from the dental pulp of extracted teeth can be turned into the specialized cells that keep corneas healthy and free of blinding scars caused by illness or injury--and that these cells could safely be injected into the corneas of mice. The approach anticipates a treatment with clear advantages over the usual method of treating corneal blindness, in which a patient's scarred corneas are replaced with healthy tissue from donor corneas. In some cases, the patient's body rejects the transplanted tissue, and donor corneas are in short supply in certain parts of the world, including Africa and Asia. Advertisement \"Our work is promising because using the patient's own cells for treatment could help avoid these problems ,\" Dr. James L. Funderburgh, professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the senior author of a new paper describing the research, said in a written statement. For the research, a team led by Dr. Fatima Syed-Picard, a post-doctoral fellow in the school's department of ophthalmology, took cells from the pulp of extracted wisdom teeth and used chemical processing to convert them into the specialized corneal cells. Then the scientists injected these so-called keratocytes into the corneas of healthy mice, where they integrated with the existing tissue with no sign of rejection even after several weeks. (Story continues below image.) Close-up photo of mouse eye showing injected cells (green). How would the treatment be used in human patients? \"We are thinking that in the future people may 'bank' their extracted wisdom teeth or the cells from those teeth,\" Funderburgh told The Huffington Post in an email. \"For someone who did not do that it is possible to extract dental pulp with a root canal procedure, but this is still hypothetical. In the worst-case scenario, someone might consider having a tooth extracted to provide cells for this procedure.\" Advertisement Last year more than 70,000 corneal transplants were performed in the U.S., Kevin Corcoran, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA), told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. \"There's a lot of exciting research being done in the area of [corneal] transplant, and EBAA is interested in any outcome that can help restore sight to the blind or visually impaired,\" said Corcoran, who was unfamiliar with the Pitt research. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Syed-Picard stressed the preliminary nature of the research and said it would probably take a few years before human testing could begin. The next step, she said, would be to conduct a similar set of experiments in rabbits. Advertisement The paper was published online Feb. 23, 2015 in the journal Stem Cells Translational Medicine.

Congress Pushes NASA To Build Deep Space Habitat For Mars Mission By 2018 The agency has received $55 million for the project. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 30, 2015, 02:21 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT This image, courtesy of NASA, shows an artist concept of Mars and a spacecraft. Credit: G\u00fcnay Mutlu/Getty Images Mars, here we come. NASA celebrated news of an unexpected windfall earlier this month when after years of penny-pinching, Congress announced it would increase the space agency\u2019s budget by $1.3 billion in 2016. Now it's emerged that a chunk of that money has been earmarked to help bolster the agency\u2019s plans for a Martian mission. As Popular Science noted, Congress directed NASA to use $55 million of its $19.3 billion budget to begin building a deep space habitat that will house astronauts during future exploratory missions to the red planet. Advertisement Congress gave the agency until 2018 to develop a decent prototype model of the \u201chabitation module.\u201d NASA must also produce a report on the status of the program in 180 days. NASA said it hopes to launch a crewed mission to Mars by the 2030s, and to begin cislunar (between Earth and the moon) testing of a workable habitat by the 2020s. As SpaceNews noted, the agency has already started working with companies like Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing and Orbital ATK to study habitat designs. The new funding and directive from Congress, however, \u201c could force NASA to speed up \u201d these plans. Advertisement NASA's habitation module may \u201c shape deep space travel for dozens of decades ,\u201d wrote Yahoo! Tech. For now, though, very little is known about the habitat, including its requirements and how it will be built. \u201cIt\u2019s much too early for that,\u201d Sam Scimemi, International Space Station director at NASA Headquarters, told SpaceNews. \u201cAs soon as I put a picture up there, somebody is going to assume what the configuration is.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Pretty Much Every Living Thing Is Already Feeling The Effects Of Climate Change \"The fact is, it's not one or two species in one or two places,\" one researcher said. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 10, 2016, 03:04 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing salamanders shrink in size,\" a researcher said. Credit: ullstein bild/Getty Images Climate change has already touched almost all life on the planet , even under moderate rates of global warming, according to a report published Thursday in the journal Science. An international team of researchers found 82 percent of key biological processes necessary for healthy ecosystems had been impacted by the phenomenon. The changes have been felt even though the world is just 1 degree Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels. Advertisement \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing salamanders shrink in size, we\u2019re seeing migratory birds change their migratory routes, we\u2019re seeing species interbreeding now, because of just a small degree of warming,\u201d said James Watson, a professor at the University of Queensland and senior author of the report. Scientists are currently gathered in Marrakech, Morocco, to work out details of the landmark Paris climate agreement , which aims to keep the world from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius. Anything hotter than that will likely cause a slew of troubling events: melting glaciers, rising seas, extreme weather and an uptick in disease. But aside from severe impacts for humanity, those shifts will drastically change worldwide biology. It's not just polar bears that are being affected by climate change. Credit: Ho New / Reuters Advertisement \u201cThe fact is, it\u2019s not one or two species in one or two places,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt\u2019s entire systems and entire processes. All the things which live in those systems are almost certainly changing their behavior, the way they live, the way they move.\u201d The recent election of Donald Trump has cast serious doubts on the future of the Paris deal. The U.S. is the world\u2019s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter and the president-elect, a denier of climate change , has threatened to pull out of the accord. A similar move by America with the Kyoto Protocol set the fight against climate change back 20 years. Leading environmental groups have stressed the need for urgency in curbing greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThe climate crisis is already having very serious consequences for life on the planet,\u201d said Jean Su, associate conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cThe 1-degree Celsius rise in temperature already has the world spinning out of control in terms of the widespread harms to species, and also people ... The need for strong climate action couldn\u2019t be clearer or as necessary as right now.\u201d Advertisement Su said the election of Trump \u201cwill purely galvanize grass-roots support for environmental action.\u201d Watson said the report was \u201cnot just doom and gloom,\u201d noting there was still time, albeit limited, to act on \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d like environmental protection and investment in renewable energy. But ecosystems will only tolerate so much. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt we\u2019re in for dramatic warming still,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re literally going into climatic spaces that are beyond the norm. With another degree, it\u2019ll almost certainly be 100 percent of species affected.

Sorry, But Cinderella's Glass Slippers Would've Shattered Also, spoiler alert, magic owls are magic. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 30, 2015, 08:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT While Cinderella would have been able to stand in those sparkling glass slippers, she would have almost certainly ended up with a sliced foot the moment she tried to run away from Prince Charming. That's according to physics students at the University of Leicester in England, who published a study in October, \" Cinderella's Shattered Dreams ,\" attempting to figure out how, exactly, the princess could have rocked glass shoes at the ball and still complied with the laws of matter and energy. The students concluded that \"in order for Cinderella to run away from the prince at midnight she would have to have a glass shoe with a heel of less than 1.15 [centimeters in height]\" -- much smaller than the size often depicted in adaptations of the fairy tale. Advertisement The Cinderella study is among a number of papers recently published in the university's Journal of Physics Special Topics , in which students put science up against fiction and fantasy. \" There\u2019s only one real world ,\" UL physics Professor Mervyn Roy, who oversees the course, told National Geographic last week. \"Students can run out of relatively simple problems because other groups have done them in the past. But once you start to look at fiction, there\u2019s a huge realm of things to explore.\" Advertisement Below, you'll find eight more scientific studies that will have you rethinking your favorite characters and stories. Superman's 'Nonsense' Approach To Time Travel videorecord052/Flickr In the 1978 film \"Superman,\" the titular hero travels back in time by flying at such high speed that he reverses the rotation of the Earth. While time travel by such an action is \"nonsense,\" Superman could have reversed the polarity of the Earth's spin if he'd increased his mass 13.7 million times by traveling extremely close to the speed of light, students at University of Leicester found in a November paper. Doing so, however, would pull asteroids and other near-Earth objects toward the planet, and would bring about changes in atmospheric pressure and wind speed that would \"most likely cause extinction,\" according to the report. \"So spread the word,\" the students write. \"Do not try this at home.\" A separate JPST study, also from November, found that it would be \" impractical for Superman to get all of his energy from sunlight , although providing he\u2019s able to store the energy it would almost be feasible for him to stop a runaway train twice per week.\" Santa -- Speedy And A Tad Younger Digital Vision. via Getty Images A December study titled \"Santa's Relativistic Journey\" found that in order for Santa Claus to deliver all his presents in one 12-hour night, he would have to travel at 76 percent the speed of light the entire time. Additionally, the students found that as a result of time dilation -- part of Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, which states that the faster you move, the more slowly time moves for you -- Santa has actually aged a tiny bit less over the years than the rest of us earthbound schlubs. If we accept the students' premise that Santa has been delivering gifts one night a year for 194 years -- a benchmark apparently based on a poem written in 1821 by one William Gilley -- that means Santa has aged about four minutes less than other stuff that has been around since 1821, like Missouri , Braille and the term \" menopause .\" Owls As Couriers -- Not So Much YouTube/Alex Green Much like nearly everything else in the Harry Potter movies, owls delivering the mail would probably require magic . In this October study, physics students investigated the possibility of owls carrying packages, including a Nimbus 2000. \"The likelihood of the combined system of owl and broomstick having a coefficient of lift high enough to allow the bird to remain in flight is small,\" the authors concluded. \"A similar argument can be applied to the variety of differently shaped and sized packages that are delivered by owls in the Harry Potter films, therefore the authors conclude that the Owl Post, without magic, is not viable.\" Advertisement Debunking The Experimental 'Microwave Emitter' In 'Batman Begins' CartelesCine/Flickr In the 2005 movie \"Batman Begins,\" an experimental weapon called a \"microwave emitter\" is used to vaporize large amounts of water using focused microwaves. A study from last month, however, asserts that Lucius Fox of Wayne Enterprises \" does not know what a microwave emitter is and must have designed something completely different.\" \"It was known from the beginning that the 'microwave' emitter would seriously damage someone, as approximately 70% of the human body is made of water,\" the authors of the study wrote. \"As such, the only reason to use the emitter is when damaging people is not a problem.\" The Flash's Smoking Soles YouTube/TV SHOWS In an episode of The CW show \"The Flash,\" Barry Allen\u2019s shoes are shown burning after he runs at superhuman speeds. To burn rubber soles, Barry would have to reach a speed of 6,911 meters per second , or 15,459 miles per hour, as students determined in a November paper. Before that could ever happen, though, his soles would be completely stripped off. A 6.4-Minute Meal For Vampires Ysbrand Cosijn via Getty Images Any more than 15 percent blood loss and a human being's heart rate starts to change. Using fluid dynamics, physics students found in October that a vampire would require about 6.4 minutes of feeding time to drink that much of a person's blood -- about 0.75 liters -- and make a swift getaway, while still minimizing \"the effects on the circulatory system.\" So that's maybe a little comforting: A prudent vampire can only spend about six and a half minutes drinking your blood before it'll need to take wing. That's about the length of a Rush song, so, not bad. Advertisement Forget About That Suit, Iron Man marvelousRoland/Flickr Iron Man's suit of armor allows the superhero born Tony Stark to survive a tremendous amount of physical trauma, including direct hits from a tank shell. While no doubt impressive, students found that a protective suit of armor for personal use is \" unrealistic as it would have to be about 3 (meters) thick .\" However, the technology could be applied to large vehicles such as ships or tanks, according to the study. For what it's worth, the students' October paper does not acknowledge that Tony's arc reactor technology is likely reversed-engineered from the Tesseract, which is an Infinity Stone, you guys, and maybe that changes the math somewhat, OK ? So take this one with a grain of salt. Icarus -- The Unlaunchable Satellite YouTube/Bob Glickstein In the 2002 James Bond film \"Die Another Day,\" an orbital satellite called Icarus is a weapon built to detonate mines placed along the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. In investigating the feasibility of building a solar-powered satellite capable of powering such a high-energy laser beam, students found it would be \" too large to be launched .\" Whoops. \"The satellite could possibly be built in stages however funding this would be very difficult as it would take several launches to complete,\" the October paper concludes.

How 3D Printing Could End The Deadly Shortage Of Donor Organs How 3D Printing Could End The Deadly Shortage Of Donor Organs By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 1, 2015, 09:51 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Three-dimensional printing has been used to make everything from pizza to prostheses , and now researchers are working on using the emerging technology to fabricate hearts, kidneys, and other vital human organs. That would be very big news, as the number of people who desperately need an organ transplant far outstrips the number of donor organs available. On average, about 21 Americans die every day because a needed organ was unavailable. Advertisement What exactly is the promise of 3D printing organs and tissues, or \" bioprinting ?\" How does the technology work, and when might it start saving lives? For answers to these and other questions, HuffPost Science reached out to Dr. Anthony Atala (right), director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine and a world-renowned expert in the field, to find out. See below for a lightly edited version of the Q & A. Can 3D printing end the shortage of organs? 3D printing is not magic. It is simply a way to scale up the current processes we use to engineer organs in the laboratory. Our team has successfully engineered bladders, cartilage, skin, urine tubes and vaginas that have been implanted in patients. Our goal is produce organ structures such as these with 3D printing to make the engineering process more precise and reproducible. The ultimate goal of regenerative medicine -\u2013 regardless of the way the organs are engineered -- is to help solve the shortage of donor organs. Advertisement How might 3D-printed organs compare to donor organs? Our goal is to engineer organs using a patient\u2019s own cells. With this approach, there would be no issues with rejection, and patients wouldn\u2019t have to take the powerful anti-rejection drugs that are now required. This is certainly one advantage of customized organs. What's the actual process by which organs would be \"printed?\" A first step in organ engineering \u2013- whether it involves 3D printing or other methods \u2013- is to get a biopsy of the organ that needs to be replaced. From this biopsy, certain cells with regenerative potential are isolated and multiplied. These cells are then mixed with a liquid material that provides oxygen and other nutrients to keep them alive. This mixture is placed in a printer cartridge. A separate printer cartridge is filled with a biomaterial that will be printed into the organ- or tissue-shaped structure. The structure is designed on a computer using a patient\u2019s medical scans. When happens when you press the \"print\" button? When the \u201cprint\u201d button is pushed, the printer builds the structure layer by layer and embeds cells into each layer. When cells are provided the right mixture of nutrients and growth factors \u2013- and placed in the right environment -- they know what to do and perform their functions. For some structures, two or more types of cells may be required. Advertisement (Story continues below image.) A 3-D printer at Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine at work on a kidney prototype. What challenges are you facing? Scientists have successfully engineered three categories of organs: flat structures such as skin; tubular structures such as urine tubes and blood vessels; and hollow structures such as the bladder. The most complex organs are solid structures such as the kidney, liver, and pancreas. Some of the challenges we face with these organs are learning to grow the billions of cells required for these organs, as well as learning how to best supply the new organs with oxygen until they integrate with the body. We are exploring a variety of options that include printing oxygen-generating materials into the structures; printing micro-channels that can maximize the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from nearby tissues; and printing blood vessels into the structures. Advertisement How many years away are we from printing complex organs like the heart and kidney? Science is unpredictable, so it is impossible to make predictions. But I think we can safely say that the timeframe required to routinely print and implant complex organs is decades, rather than years. What are some recent breakthroughs that have brought us closer to making 3D printed organs a reality? We are continuing to refine our printers to increase printing resolution and learning how to keep the printing process from damaging cells. In addition, we are making advances in identifying which biomaterials work best for specific structures. And, we are great making strides printing with multiple cells types and controlling placement of cells. Advertisement What are the next steps? One relatively new bioprinting project, funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, aims to print mini hearts, livers, blood vessels, and lung on a chip system. Called a \u201cBody on a Chip,\u201d this project has the potential to test new drugs more accurately and perhaps eliminate the need for testing in animals. The immediate goal is to test effects on the body of biological weapons and to develop antidotes.

Behavioral Science May Prove to Be Our Most Important Science We take for granted the impact of the physical and biological sciences on our world, forgetting that it once took months to get from the east coast to the west coast or to communicate with someone across the ocean.

We take for granted the impact of the physical and biological sciences on our world, forgetting that it once took months to get from the East coast to the West coast or to communicate with someone across the ocean. Science has dramatically improved our health too. In nineteenth century England more than 100,000 people died of cholera before John Snow showed that contaminated water was the cause of cholera. It might seem that no such stunning changes are possible when it comes to human behavior. We continue to have significant problems with crime, drug abuse, depression, academic failure, and poverty. Reading the headlines, you might think that we have made no progress on these problems and that no change is possible. Advertisement But you would be wrong. A great deal of progress has taken place on how we can treat and prevent these problems and it is this science that has the potential to enhance human wellbeing far beyond the physical sciences. If you are unaware of the progress of the behavioral sciences, it is because progress is relatively recent and because the policies and programs that can prevent or ameliorate these problems are not yet in widespread use. We are on the cusp of a revolution in the use of behavioral science that will improve the wellbeing of people in ways that will prove as dramatic as the changes we have seen in medicine, physics, and chemistry. The Institute of Medicine's report on prevention put it this way: \"The scientific foundation has been created for the nation to begin to create a society in which young people arrive at adulthood with the skills, interests, assets, and health habits needed to live healthy, happy, and productive lives in caring relationships with others.\" Advertisement The report showed that over the past 40 years, behavioral scientists have developed preventive interventions for every phase of development -- from the prenatal period through adolescence. Numerous programs for families and schools have been shown, through rigorous randomized trials, to prevent multiple problems among young people. Most of these interventions continue to prevent problems long after the program has ended. And most save far more money in reduced criminal justice, victim, special education, and healthcare costs than it takes to deliver them. At the same time, behavioral scientists have identified an array of policies that are beneficial in preventing problems like alcohol-related injuries and adolescent smoking initiation. Similar progress has been made in how to treat people who have problems. Steve Hayes has written on this site about many of the interventions that are revolutionizing clinical psychology. Advertisement Simply reading the research won't bring you in contact with the children and adults whose lives are changing for the better. For example, the Nurse Family Partnership has proven benefit in helping poor, at-risk mothers during their first pregnancy and the first two years of their babies' lives. It has already reached more than 200,000 mothers. It has helped women like Shanice by providing a caring, knowledgeable nurse to help her get the social and medical support she needed during her pregnancy and to guide her in how to care for her infant. In the first evaluation of this program, 35% of the children who didn't get the program were arrested by the age of fifteen, but among those who were in the program, fewer than half as many were arrested. Think what the impact of that may have been among the more than 200,000 families that benefited from this program. Or consider the Good Behavior Game , which is increasingly being used in schools throughout North America. It helps children learn to cooperate and concentrate. Small teams of students earn simple rewards, such as a chance to dance or make funny noises after they have worked together successfully for short periods. A study of the Good Behavior Game done at John Hopkins University showed that young people who played the Game in just first or second grade were less likely to be arrested or to smoke by middle school. By the time they were entering adulthood, those who got the Good Behavior Game had less suicidal behavior and drug abuse and were more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. The game changes lives. Advertisement The widespread implementation of the programs, policies, and practices that behavioral scientists have developed can have significant benefit for millions of Americans. But we will not achieve all of the improvements in human wellbeing that are possible unless we also reduce poverty and economic inequality. The U. S. has the highest level of child poverty of any developed nation. This is because in the past half century public policy has evolved in a direction that most of us didn't want it to go. Before John Snow showed that contaminated water caused cholera, raw sewage emptied into the Thames upstream from the intake of drinking water. Now such unsanitary conditions would be unthinkable. I look forward to the day when it will be unthinkable to allow a child to live in an environment that fails to nurture their development. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA Plans Emergency Spacewalk To Replace Key Computer On International Space Station The computer is one of two that control major U.S. systems aboard the orbiting outpost. By Irene Klotz May 22, 2017, 01:28 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A pair of astronauts will venture outside the International Space Station on Tuesday for an emergency spacewalk to replace a failed computer, one of two that control major U.S. systems aboard the orbiting outpost, NASA said on Sunday. The primary device failed on Saturday, leaving the $100 billion orbiting laboratory to depend on a backup system to route commands to its solar power system, radiators, cooling loops and other equipment. The station\u2019s current five-member crew from the United States, Russia and France were never in any danger, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement.

New Type Of Moon Rock Discovered By China's Yutu Lunar Rover Findings may be key to unlocking the origins of Earth's nearest neighbor. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Dec 29, 2015, 04:26 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A new kind of volcanic rock has been found on the Moon. China's Yutu lunar rover made the discovery on a long-dead lava flow in the giant Mare Imbrium dark spot, according to a study published last Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. The volcanic rock known as basalt has intermediate levels of titanium , in contrast to the high or low levels found in rocks brought back by the Soviet Union Luna and U.S. Apollo missions of the '60s and '70s, reports Smithsonian Magazine. Advertisement According to the Guardian, scientists believe the finding could shed even more light on how Earth's nearest neighbor and satellite was created. A model of the lunar rover known as The Yutu, or Jade Rabbit. Credit: PETER PARKS via Getty Images China's lunar mission touched down for the first soft landing on the Moon in almost 40 years in 2013, per Mashable. But the \"Jade Rabbit\" lander, as it was nicknamed, was beset by problems from the outset after its systems almost immediately started locking up. This meant it could only analyze the rocks surrounding it, The New York Times reports. Advertisement When it eventually started pinging back data, planetary scientists were pleasantly surprised. The rocks were different from what had been found before, and were rich in iron oxide and olivine. \"The diversity tells us that the Moon's upper mantle is much less uniform in composition than Earth's,\" Bradley Jolliff, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis and one of the authors of the study, said in a statement . \"And correlating chemistry with age, we can see how the Moon's volcanism changed over time.\" The left part of this picture of the Moon -- taken by the Galileo spacecraft in 1992 -- shows the dark, lava-filled Mare Imbrium Credit: Stocktrek Images via Getty Images Advertisement It's hoped that the discovery may help to further understanding of the Moon's origins, which are currently thought to have formed out of debris when a Mars-sized object crashed into the Earth, per the Guardian. The Moon's interior separated into a crust, mantle and core. Then, 500 million years after its formation, radioactivity inside the mantle caused volcanic eruptions, which spewed lava out onto the surface. Rocks found during the Soviet and American missions are believed to be 3 to 4 billion years old, according to Mashable. But the Yutu's findings are estimated to be just 3 billion years old, the Daily Star reports, meaning scientists may be able to create a timeline showing when the magma from the eruptions cooled and solidified. Lead study author Zongcheng Ling, of Shandong University, told Gizmodo that the findings were just the beginning . Advertisement \"We will continue our in-depth studies for these young lunar basalts,\" he said. \"Probably in combination with other lunar datasets, lunar meteorites studies and chemical modeling methods, we can better understand the petrogenisis history of these unique young lunar basalts.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Exercise Changed This Neuroscientist\u2019s Life And Now She Wants To Change Yours New research is increasingly discovering the benefits of physical exercise for the brain. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Nov 2, 2016, 09:44 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Devoted to solving intricate physiological questions about the brain for almost her entire adult life, Wendy Suzuki, a neuroscientist at New York University, was proud of her work. But the long hours dedicated to research eventually left her feeling socially isolated and physically weak. Taking up a habit of regularly visiting the gym changed all that \u2014 so profoundly that she decided to also change the focus of her studies and become a beginner researcher in the neuroscience of exercise at 51 years old. That meant giving up the reputation she had built over 25 years to enter a field where no one knew her. Advertisement \u201cIt was a hard decision and it was scary,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cBut once I made the decision I knew it was the right one.\u201d She also thought it was a particularly good decision because the results of her work, which focuses on understanding the effects of exercise on the brain, could quickly lead to tangible benefits. \u201cThe thing that was really exciting and appealing is that this was the kind of research that could immediately be applied to helping people live their life better,\u201d she said. Advertisement We\u2019ve long known that exercise makes for a healthier, fitter body. But its similar effects on the brain have only come to light in recent years. In fact, just the idea that the brain can change at all in response to experiences is something that had not garnered much evidence until the late 20th century. One of the first experiments to show the flexibility of the brain was done in 1972, when researchers put mice in a fun cage equipped with running wheels and toys, and found the cortex area of the rodents\u2019 brains grew thicker, whereas it didn\u2019t in mice kept in a dull, small cage. Later it was found that although we are endowed with a set amount of long-lasting neurons, new neurons could still be born in adulthood. More importantly, this occurs in the hippocampus, a critical structure for memory and learning. And what can boost the generation of new neurons there? Aerobic exercise. The hippocampus is one of the primary targets of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s. So building up the hippocampus over a lifetime could potentially delay the effects of diseases. Advertisement \u201cExercise is not going to cure Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia but it anatomically strengthens two of the key targets of both those diseases, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cYour hippocampus will be bigger if you exercise regularly, so that means that it\u2019s going to take that much longer for the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer\u2019s disease to cause behavioral effects. That means months, or hopefully years, of higher cognitive function.\u201d The creation of new neurons, or neurogenesis, doesn\u2019t happen overnight, however. Neurons don\u2019t just pop up fully formed and fully integrated. They are born as immature cells and take several months to grow. But that\u2019s not to say that all positive effects will be delayed by three or four months if you start exercising now. As many people have noticed firsthand, exercising also makes the mind sharper and attention more focused. That\u2019s because another brain area heavily affected by aerobic exercise is the prefrontal cortex, an area in charge of high-level cognition, executive functions, decision-making and attention. Advertisement Exactly how it happens is not fully known, but it seems that the prefrontal cortex is actually relaxing during intense physical activity. It then gets a rebound increase in blood flow after the exercise, enabling it to work at full speed. It\u2019s also possible that the same bodily changes that help new neurons grow in the hippocampus are also at work in the prefrontal cortex and help grow glial cells and blood vessels. So which type of exercise is best from the brain\u2019s point of view? Here\u2019s what we can tell from research so far: Mood : Walking, aerobic exercise and high-intensity interval training can improve your mood. \u201cWe recently did a study comparing the three. All three of them improved mood but the one that did the most was walking. That\u2019s good news for people who don\u2019t have a high-level aerobic regime on hand,\u201d Suzuki said. Advertisement Memory : The best evidence for hippocampal neurogenesis is continuous aerobic exercise. \u201cYou have to get your heart rate up. So a good 45-minute workout,\u201d Suzuki said. Attention : Aerobic exercise is again the best option if you want to boost attention. But unlike with memory, the improvements are more acute and come faster. Jogging, biking and treadmill running are all good options for getting a boost in the prefrontal cortex.

Men Totally Overestimate Their Math Skills And It May Explain The STEM Gender Gap Men Are Totally Wrong About Their Math Skills By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jun 25, 2015, 04:53 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Men significantly outnumber women in technology and science-related professions -- but it's not because they're more skilled in those areas. New research suggests that the answer may lie not in men's skills or interests, but rather in the beliefs they hold about their abilities to do the complicated mathematics central to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. Advertisement Researchers from Washington State University found that men tend to significantly overestimate their math abilities, while women are generally more accurate in their self-assessments. For the study, 122 undergraduates at the university were asked to complete a math test and then guess how well they had performed on the test. In one experiment, the students were told their test scores and then were asked again to take a math test and predict their scores. In a second experiment, the students took the test without getting feedback about their scores but were asked whether they planned to pursue a math-related course of study or career. The results revealed that the male students tended to overestimate their test scores, while the female students predicted their scores fairly accurately. Men were also more likely to say that they would pursue STEM-related classes or careers, likely attributable in part to their inflated confidence in their math skills, according to the study's author. Advertisement However, when both men and women were given feedback about their scores and then asked to retake the test, the perception gap all but disappeared. \"Gender gaps in the science, technology, engineering and maths fields are not necessarily the result of women's underestimating their abilities, but rather may be due to men's overestimating their abilities,\" Shane Bench, a postgraduate student at the university and the study's lead author, said in a statement . Even with girls across the globe now academically outperforming boys in math and science, there is sizeable gender gap in STEM fields. Advertisement A first step to narrowing the gap may be to ensure that girls and women receive constructive feedback about their math performance and opportunities to enjoy positive STEM experiences. Indeed, the findings revealed that women who had better STEM-related experiences in the past were more likely to overestimate how well they did on the test. \"Increasing women's positivity bias in academic domains... could be done by providing positive math experiences at a young age,\" Bench said in an email to The Huffington Post. \"This could provide women with a more positively biased perception (overestimation) of performance, which could encourage the persistence needed to overcome challenge in the early stages, and persevere into STEM careers.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Colossal Black Hole Is 12 Billion Times As Massive As The Sun, And It Has Astronomers Baffled Colossal Black Hole Has Astronomers Baffled By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 25, 2015, 02:14 PM EST Astronomers have discovered a truly colossal black hole. It's 12 billion times as massive as our sun and about 3,000 times the size of the black hole at the center of our galaxy. What's more, the distant hole appears to have ballooned to its supermassive size very early in the universe's history -- just 900 million years after the Big Bang -- and that's got astronomers baffled. Black holes should take billions of years to get that big, according to current theories, and there are theoretical limits on how fast they can grow . So the existence of the newfound monster is raising serious questions about how black holes evolve. Advertisement \"The discovery of this record-breaking monster black hole ... raises an embarrassing unanswered question: how did it form?\" Dr. Max Tegmark, a MIT cosmologist who was not involved in the discovery, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"If it started out as a collapsing star, then this black hole ate about a billion times its birth weight to get this heavy: how did it manage to eat so much in so little time?\" (Story continues below image). Artist's impression of a quasar with a supermassive black hole in the distant universe. The black hole lies at the center of a bright cloud of material, a celestial object known as a quasar , called SDSS J0100+2802. This object is located 12.8 billion light-years from Earth and is 420 trillion times brighter than the sun. Advertisement The quasar was spotted by a team of researchers using the Lijiang Telescope in Yunnan, China -- and the mass and distance of the black hole were confirmed by observations made with telescopes in Arizona, Hawaii, and Chile. Though black holes can't be seen directly, astronomers can infer their existence and size based on observations of the matter falling into them. The researchers hope that further observations of the quasar, using the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-Ray Telescope, will shed new light on the formation of black holes and galaxies in the early universe. \"This quasar is very unique,\" co-researcher Dr. Xue-Bing Wu, an astronomy professor at Peking University and the associate director of the Kavli Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said in the statement. \"Just like the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe, its glowing light will help us to probe more about the early universe.\" Advertisement The newly discovered quasar, SDSS J0100+2802, is the one with the most massive black hole and the highest luminosity among all known distant quasars. The background photo, provided by Yunnan Observatory, shows the dome of the 2.4-meter telescope and the sky above it.

SpaceX Launches Its First Recycled Cargo Ship Into Orbit The refurbished capsule brings us one step closer to cheaper space travel. By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Jun 3, 2017, 09:41 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT SpaceX has made history again, this time by sending its first-ever recycled cargo ship to the International Space Station . This launch brings the aerospace company one step closer to making flights to space more affordable with reused rockets and capsules. A Falcon 9 rocket launched the recycled Dragon capsule at 5:07 p.m. local time Saturday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Shortly after the first-stage booster launched the Dragon into orbit, it fell away from the capsule, flipped around, fired its engines and landed safely at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , according to Florida Today. Advertisement As ABC News pointed out, used rockets are now returned for a vertical touchdown as part of SpaceX\u2019s efforts to lower the cost of flights. The booster launched Saturday likely will be used again. The Dragon made its first trip to space in 2014 , delivering food and supplies to the ISS, according to science news site Phys.org. It was refurbished after landing in the Pacific Ocean intact. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with the recycled Dragon spacecraft onboard, launches from the Kennedy Space Center on June 3 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images Advertisement Saturday\u2019s refurbished capsule will deliver 6,000 pounds of supplies to the ISS , including mice and flies to be used for research, a roll-up solar panel, food and a neutron star detector, according to NBC News. The flight had been delayed twice due to thunderstorms. \u201cIt\u2019s a pre-flown Dragon, and that is a pretty big deal too ,\u201d Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX\u2019s vice president of flight reliability, told Florida Today. \u201cThat lines up well with our quest to reuse [vehicles] and reusability, and overall in the long-term lowering the cost of access to space.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The reused Dragon is expected to reach the orbiting lab on Monday. It will be the first returning craft since NASA\u2019s now-retired shuttles. Advertisement SpaceX celebrated another breakthrough about two months ago when it launched the first recycled orbital rocket , a Falcon 9, from the Kennedy Space Center and successfully landed it on an ocean platform named Of Course I Still Love You . CLARIFICATION: The headline and article have been updated to indicate, as originally reported further down in the piece, that this is SpaceX\u2019s first recycled ship, not the first recycled ships ever used for space travel.

Protest Again Delays Hawaii Giant Telescope Construction Protest Again Delays Hawaii Giant Telescope Construction By Landess Kearns Senior Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Jun 24, 2015, 09:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Work on the controversial Thirty Meter Telescope on the Big Island of Hawaii was delayed again Wednesday after construction vehicles were blocked by hundreds of protesters, who say the giant telescope is being built on land sacred to Native Hawaiians. Protesters pushed boulders into the road to the construction site atop Mauna Kea and stood in the way of vehicles, forcing construction crews to retreat and cancel work for the day. Twelve people were arrested and Gov. David Ige (D) announced Wednesday evening that construction on the telescope would be put on hold again until further notice , according to local reports. Advertisement Work on what will be among the world's largest telescopes had been set to resume Wednesday morning after April protests led Gov. Ige to call for a \"timeout\" on construction so that developers and protesters could discuss stewardship of the mountain. Ige has since announced his support for the project's legality. #BREAKINGNEWS: Hawaii DLNR (Department of Land and Natural Resources) agents just informed the hundreds of protestors who have gathered to prevent the Thirty Meter Telescope construction, that officers & TMT workers will be turning around and no longer asking anyone to leave or make any further arrests. More than 700 people gathered to stand in what they say is protection of a sacred Native Hawaiian space. Seven hours after protestors began lining up to prevent construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on the on the summit of Mauna Kea, only 10 people have been arrested and the TMT crew only made it about 1.5 miles up the road. More details tonight on Hawaii News Now Developing details: http://bit.ly/1Ie7Tcn#HawaiiNewsNow #HINews #BehindTheScenes #WeAreYourSource Posted by Mileka Lincoln on Wednesday, June 24, 2015 The telescope debate has been emotional for both sides . A state Department of Land and Natural Resources agent addressed protesters Wednesday with tears in his eyes. He apologized to the crowd, clearly familiar with him, saying, \"You may not accept it, but I got to do my job.\" He then told them, \"Our number one thing right now is public safety. We're not going up.\" He was met by cheers of \"mahalo\" (thank you) and hugs. According to Hawaii News Now, protesters moved large rocks into the road to block the construction vehicles on Wednesday. West Hawaii Today reports that the construction vehicles, which were being escorted by police, \"were stopped repeatedly by more than 300 protesters who set up about two dozen 'lines of defense' across the Mauna Kea access road.\" Many Native Hawaiians believe Mauna Kea is where the Hawaiian islands originated, making it sacred land. They refer to themselves as \"protectors\" of the mountain, rather than protesters. Advertisement Story continues below...

Kahookahi Kanuha, one of those arrested, told The Associated Press earlier in the day, \" We're bracing ourselves mentally, spiritually for the battle ahead. I don't mean a physical battle. It's brain against brain.\" Story continues below...

Scientists say that such a powerful telescope ideally located on Mauna Kea's summit will allow astronomers to see \" forming galaxies at the very edge of the observable Universe, near the beginning of time, \" according to the TMT website. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Brain Science Explains the Way We See #TheDress Upon the electronic distribution of a picture of nothing more than a dress, we saw the birth of the stalwart White-and-golders and the die-hard Black-and-bluers. This dress is a nice example of how what youisn't necessarily what you. By Michael Buice, Contributor Scientist, Allen Institute for Brain Science Scientist, Allen Institute for Brain Science Mar 3, 2015, 02:13 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

In our philosophy have been dreamt the plays of Shakespeare and the computations of Alan Turing, not to mention the staggering technology underlying the phone on which you are perhaps reading these words. And while we've taken great advantage of it, it turns out that this inventiveness is actually necessary for a more fundamental reason. Your brain is forced into being creative in order to perform the simple act of seeing the world around you. Perception is a type of problem that mathematicians refer to as \"ill-posed\". Because of nothing more than light and geometry, a given image can have an infinite number of possible causes in the real world. Nonetheless, perception is a problem our brains must solve, so that we can find food, shelter, and each other. Faced with this dilemma, the brain must resort to inference. Essentially, it must make guesses, albeit educated ones. One consequence of this is that while we all live in the same world, we don't always see it the same way. Advertisement Naturally, this leads to the beautiful diversity of human minds, for both good and ill. Recently, upon the electronic distribution of a picture of nothing more than a dress, it saw the birth of the stalwart White-and-golders and the die-hard Black-and-bluers. This dress is a nice example of how what you see isn't necessarily what you perceive . Let's take a look, shall we? So what color is it? White-and-gold or black-and-blue? Since we have access to the raw image, we can peak inside at the pixel values to find that the dress is (on average) composed of the following two colors: So, go team \"bluish-gray-and-brown\"! Determination of color is based on a complicated inference, involving surrounding colors, local brightness cues and shape. Ed Adelson has some wonderful and now relatively famous brightness illusions on his website, such as the checker shadow illusion . Advertisement Color interpretation relies on the same kind of contextual inference as brightness. In Bloj, Kersten, and Hurlbert (1999) the authors demonstrated that context inferred from depth could change the perceived color of an object. They showed subjects a card, half magenta and half white, folded along the divide like a bi-fold pamphlet, so that the right side appeared magenta and the left side appeared pale pink, owing to the reflected luminance. Subjects report exactly that. When viewed through a pseudoscope, which flips disparity cues so that the crease on the folded card appears pointed towards the subject, subjects report that the left side also appears as magenta, rather than pink. The reversal of depth destroys any possible interpretation of this luminance as reflection. Humans also have strong built in assumptions about perceived light sources. In terms of brightness, humans have a \" light-from-above \" prior that determines how we often interpret shapes. Loosely speaking, the sun is above us, and this fact is used to determine the perceived shapes of surfaces. Notice how the figure below appears to be a \"bump\" coming out of the screen rather than a dimple. If you are reading this on a phone, try turning it around and see what happens. In the case of the dress, one's assumptions about lighting have a strong impact on the perceived color. In particular, your perception will be affected by whether your visual system sees the dress as being in bright light or in shadow. Comic book colorist Nathan Fairbairn put together the following in order to illustrate these two different potential hypotheses about light and color in the picture. Advertisement So what happens if we try to remove contextual information? It so happens that these average colors are close to being inverses of one another. Inverting them gives us: Inverting the colors in the original photo should approximately \"swap\" the two colors on the dress, as well as remove contextual information (or perhaps render it nonsensical). The color inverted dress looks like: I see white-and-gold here, and I saw white-and-gold in the original. My wife is a die hard Black-and-bluer, and she sees the inverted dress as light-blue-and-gold. Notice that the image now has artifacts that look (to me anyway) like damage in an old photograph. This is a sample size of one, so I'm curious to know if this inversion changes the perceptions of any other black-and-bluers out there. Advertisement We know that training can alter the \"light-from-above\" prior, and it seems plausible that people's differing perceptions of the photo are due to their different experience, and in particular their experience with light, shading, material, and overexposed photographs. Our brains have to make guesses, but they don't always make the same guesses, even though we live in the same world. One of the hardest inference problems our brains have to solve is figuring out how everyone else sees the world. Perhaps with some very hard work, I can be a Black-and-bluer, too. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What Actually Causes Body Odor? It's never as smelly as you think it is.

LEAVE A COMMENT By Claire Maldarelli Anthony Delano/Creative Commons Body odor is a universal human experience. As such, we as a species put a lot of time, money, and effort into finding ways to eliminate unpleasant natural stenches. But most of us put less time, if any, into understanding what actually causes our malodorous condition. But understanding the processes that create b.o. is the first step to creating a less smelly future. George Preti, an organic chemist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, says the amount of odor you produce \u2014 and the power of its stench \u2014 is actually largely based on your genetics, which help determine what types of molecules your body produces, and in what quantity. And your body is truly a b.o. wonderland: different regions of the body produce their own strange molecular secretions and play host to different sorts of microbes. In order to generate odor, you need the proper combination of microbes and secretions. That blend only happens in certain prime locations. Advertisement The human body has two types of sweat glands: eccrine and apocrine. Eccrine glands are present all over, and typically secrete sweat that is mostly made of water. Their purpose is to keep your body cool when you\u2019re exposed to heat or enduring intense exercise. Apocrine glands, however, are located in targeted areas of the body \u2014 the armpits, for example \u2014 and they don\u2019t really do much to cool you down. Instead they release proteins, and those molecules are the real smell culprits. Bacteria that live on the outside of your armpits disrupt the outer shell of the proteins once they\u2019re secreted, releasing odor. \u201cUnderstanding the processes that create b.o. is the first step to creating a less smelly future.\u201d All the teeny tiny organisms on your skin interact with your body in some form or another, and they are all capable of instigating some sort of odor. The reason certain odors are worse than others, says Preti, is because microbes become ecologically adapted to the environments that they are in. At some point, some kind of microbe-induced smell might have served a purpose. Studies in other animals have found that such odors can have physiological effects on the body that promote reproduction, which in turn helps you pass on your genes and create new humans for microbes to feast on. Advertisement These days, we tend to do everything we can to mask and eliminate these odors. But Preti says a lot of our most common efforts are misguided. Because the quantity of smell-inducing proteins you secrete is largely based on your genetics, there isn\u2019t much you can do about stench at its source. Despite popular belief, Preti says, eating spicy food, onions, curry, or garlic is not going to make your body produce more potentially smelly proteins. But certain foods can still make you smell worse: if pungent foods contain fat-soluble compounds that dissolve in your body fat, they\u2019ll often get released in your sweat. So you won\u2019t make more odor proteins, but you may add a note of garlic to your signature perfume. But one popular theory \u2014 that the sweat you produce when you are nervous is more smelly than the sweat you produce if you are trying to cool yourself down \u2014 is actually quite true. That\u2019s because the sweat you produce as a result of an anxious moment comes mostly from your apocrine glands, which are the ones that contain those smell-inducing proteins. If you are trying to reduce the odor you produce, Preti says that deodorants and antiperspirants do a decent job (deodorants mask the smell with a fragrance while antiperspirants reduce the amount of sweat). As for probiotic deodorant, which is meant to promote certain bacterial colonies over others, Preti says until evidence-based research shows certain strains are significantly effective, consumers should be wary of the claims made by these products. His biggest piece of advice, rather, is just trying to relax throughout the day. Do your best not to provoke those apocrine glands. Advertisement But your big takeaway should be this: you\u2019re almost certainly less smelly than you think you are. \u201cI\u2019ve smelled so many clothes of people who come into our lab saying that they have the worst body odor in the world,\u201d Preti says. \u201cWe smell it using a rating scale, and it\u2019s hardly ever bad.\u201d Humans tune out the smells we smell all the time, but when you\u2019re hit with a spike in smelly sweat, you\u2019re likely to imagine it\u2019s worse than it is \u2014 because your nose has a front row seat. \u201cBut they are not producing the odor at social distances,\u201d Preti says. \u201cThat would be an extremely unusual case.\u201d So if you think you have the worst body odor in the world, you probably don\u2019t. And the odor that you do produce isn\u2019t really your\u2014it\u2019s just the interaction of your naturally-produced proteins with typically harmless bacteria on your skin. And if you are still concerned, just ask a considerate friend (who is standing an appropriate distance away) if they can smell anything funky. The answer will probably be no. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Warm Neptune' Exoplanet Atmosphere Consists Of Hydrogen, Helium, Water Vapor NASA: \"This is the best measurement of water to date on an exoplanet of this size.\" By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost May 12, 2017, 10:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An illustration of the distant \u201cwarm Neptune\u201d exoplanet, dubbed HAT-P-26b. The atmosphere appears to be composed of hydrogen and helium, along with water vapor. NASA/GSFC Scientists are studying water vapor in the atmosphere of an exoplanet discovered in 2011, dubbed HAT-P-26b. NASA reports that combined observations from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes reveal this planet \u2015 more than 430 light-years from Earth \u2015 has an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Orbiting a sun that\u2019s twice as old as our own, HAT-P-26b is approximately the same size as one of our solar system\u2019s outer planets, Neptune , which also has a hydrogen-helium atmosphere. HAT-P-26b is considered a \u201cWarm Neptune\u201d because it orbits its sun more closely than our own Neptune does. Advertisement According to NASA , \u201cHAT-P-26b\u2019s atmosphere is relatively clear of clouds and has a strong water signature, although the planet is not a water world. This is the best measurement of water to date on an exoplanet of this size.\u201d At the University of Exeter in the U.K., astrophysics professor David Sing is a co-leader of the HAT-P-26b research team, and co-author of a study published May 11 in the journal Science . \u201cThis \u2018Warm Neptune\u2019 is a much smaller planet than those we have been able to characterize in depth, so this new discovery about its atmosphere feels like a big breakthrough in our pursuit to learn more about how solar systems are formed, and how it compares to our own,\u201d Sing explained in a University of Exeter statement. Advertisement The following video demonstrates how astronomers discover exoplanets using the transit method. HAT-P-26b study leader Hannah Wakeford , of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said the research is important because it changes how scientists think about the birth and evolution of planetary systems. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
