How Scott Kelly Will Have To Readjust To Life On Earth Pass -- don't float -- the ketchup! By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 3, 2016, 09:50 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT From the number of daily sunrises to preparing a cup of coffee , living in microgravity about 250 miles above the Earth is remarkably different from terrestrial life. Scott Kelly , who recently wrapped up a 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station, is among the rare few who understands this well. \" I've been up here for a really long time and sometimes, when I think about it, I feel like I've lived my whole life up here,\" Kelly told CNN on Tuesday. Advertisement Scott Kelly participates in a spacewalk outside the International Space Station in December, 2015. ASSOCIATED PRESS While the year in space wasn't Kelly's first (he's been on a total of four missions), it was his longest -- and longer than any other American astronaut . It will take time for him to re-acclimate, both physically and mentally , to life back on Earth. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Below, a look at five ways Kelly must readjust -- for better or worse -- after his extended stay in space. Advertisement Sleeping NASA If you think floating sounds like a pleasant way to get to sleep, think again. In a recent Q&A on Tumblr , Kelly said that while he's never been a great sleeper, he gets less sleep in space and \"definitely misses sleeping in a bed.\" Unlike collapsing into your bed after a long day, sleep in microgravity means there is \" no change in the level of relaxation or comfort you experience ,\" Kelly told ABC News. Space also impacted on Kelly's dreaming. \"In the beginning, most of my dreams were Earth-based,\" he wrote. \"Then, they became space-based . And now as I am getting ready to return home, I am dreaming of Earth again.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

A Group Of Scientists Is Begging Obama To Save Right Whales Seismic exploration in the Atlantic may bring about their extinction, they say. By Willa Frej Reporter, HuffPost Apr 14, 2016, 04:10 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Twenty-seven marine biologists penned a letter to President Barack Obama on Thursday urgently asking him to defer seismic exploration in the Atlantic Ocean that could lead to the extinction of North Atlantic right whales. Right whales are already one of the world\u2019s most critically endangered whale species , two of the letter's authors Douglas Nowacek and Andrew Read said in a Duke University statement. There are fewer than 500 whales, according to recent estimates. The decreasing number of right whales is \"directly linked to the disproportionately high level of human activity\" the letter said. Advertisement \"This is an animal that has persisted through centuries of past whaling,\u201d Howard Rosenbaum, one of the letter's authors and the Wildlife Conservation Society's Ocean Giants Program director, told The Huffington Post. The species \u201cis no longer increasing in abundance and may be declining in numbers. It also suffers from getting hit by ships and fishing gear entanglement. We also know that elevated noise levels in their environment cause stress.\" In addition to elevated stress levels, seismic surveys can \"disrupt vital communication such as between mother and calf,\" he added. The surveys are \"adding yet another major stressor into their already-stressed environment.\" What a seismic research vessel looks like. Stringer Turkey / Reuters Advertisement Seismic surveys are used to detect underwater fossil fuel deposits in order to map out future oil and gas extraction. Companies have applied to survey a 90,000-mile area off the East Coast, \"running back and forth over the same area during the first year alone,\" a joint statement said. \u201cAll of this is undetectable to someone at the surface, but the underwater impact and disturbance from these activities can be devastating to ocean life,\u201d Christopher Clark, senior scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology Bioacoustics Research Program, said in the Duke statement. The surveys would expose the whales to high-decibel underwater sounds akin to \"intense explosions\" which go off every nine to 11 seconds for weeks or even months at a time, the statement said. They could represent a \"tipping point\" toward extinction, according to the letter. Advertisement Other letter signatories include experts at Cornell's Lab of Ornithology, the New England Aquarium, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Duke. The letter is based on New England Aquarium data spanning 30 years. The Obama administration decided last month to exclude the southeast Atlantic coast from its five-year oil and drilling plan , but seismic activity can continue. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Spy Rare Carpet Of Crabs Swarming Across Deep Sea Floor Crabnado is here. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 12, 2016, 03:54 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT While diving in a manned submersible off the coast of Panama, scientists witnessed something you might expect to see on an anthill or beehive -- or maybe in a low-budget horror film. \" There was this turbid layer , and you couldn't see a thing beyond it. We just saw this cloud but had no idea what was causing it,\" Jes\u00fas Pineda, a biologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said in a statement. \"As we slowly moved down to the bottom of the seafloor, all of the sudden we saw these things.\" There, nearly 1,200 feet below the surface, a cloud of thousands of red crabs marched eerily along the ocean floor. Advertisement At first, Pineda and his team were convinced they were looking at some sort of rocky structure. \"Once we saw them moving -- swarming like insects -- we couldn't believe it,\" he said in the statement. The researchers captured video (below) of the massive swarm -- a crabnado, if you will -- along the northwest flank of the Hannibal Bank seamount, roughly 12 miles west of Coiba Island, Panama. Pineda and his team also described the mesmerizing encounter in a paper published Tuesday in the journal PeerJ . Advertisement The animals were identified as Pleuroncodes planipes , commonly known as the red crab or tuna crab, a species abundant in Baja California, according to a release. These crabs have never before been documented this far south. \"To find a species at the extreme of their range and to be so abundant is very unusual,\" Pineda said. Advertisement As for why the crabs were found in such deep, low-oxygen conditions, Pineda said it could be that they \"provide a refuge for this species from predators.\" The research team says it plans to return to Hannibal Bank to continue its investigation into why seamounts are such biodiversity hotspots. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Jupiter May Be To Blame For The Fate Of Our Solar System's Missing Planet The planet -- which would have been our solar system's fifth giant -- had a bumpy ride on its way out, scientists say. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Nov 7, 2015, 09:06 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have long suspected that our solar system was once home to a mysterious planet -- similar to the four giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- but something happened about four billion years ago that caused the planet to disappear. Now, a team of astrophysicists in Toronto have made significant steps towards solving the mystery. According to new research, published in the latest issue of The Astronomical Journal , a collision with Jupiter resulted in the ancient planet being ejected from our solar system. Advertisement \"This is consistent with our expectation that if you want to eject a planet from the solar system, then you likely need a massive planet,\" Ryan Cloutier, a Ph.D candidate in the University of Toronto's department of astronomy and astrophysics and lead author of the new research, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Although our results may not have been that surprising, I was very excited.\" The researchers created computer simulations of our solar system's four giant planets and their moons, including Jupiter's moon Callisto and Saturn's moon Iapetus. In a process of elimination, the researchers then measured whether each moon in the solar system would have still followed its current orbit if its host planet was responsible for ejecting the ancient lost planet some four billion years ago. Advertisement The researchers found that Jupiter, the largest world in our solar system, was the only one capable of ejecting the lost planet while retaining the current orbits of its moons. For instance, in order for Saturn to have ejected the long-lost planet, the collision of the two planets would have been so violent that Iapetus's orbit around Saturn would have been thrown off course. \"Conversely,\" Cloutier said, \"if you run the same experiment with Jupiter you find that Jupiter is capable of ejecting the fifth giant planet whilst retaining an orbit of its moon Callisto.\" Advertisement The researchers concluded that a planetary collision with Jupiter was sufficient to eject the lost planet -- which they believe was an ice giant like Uranus and Neptune -- out of our solar system. Their simulations also provide evidence that the long-lost ice giant indeed was once part of our solar system. \"I was happy because this meant that we don't refute the existence of the fifth giant planet,\" Cloutier said. \"Having had a fifth giant planet that got ejected from our solar system billions of years ago is cool.\" An artist's impression of the missing ice giant planet that may have been ejected from the early solar system. Southwest Research Institute Advertisement It turns out that the planet may have had a bumpy ride before it was booted from our solar system. In August, a separate team of researchers created computer simulations that suggested the ice planet may have knocked into Neptune before it was ejected. Dr. David Nesvorny, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who led the Neptune study, told HuffPost that his simulations seem to align with the findings in the new research. \"In fact, it is expected from [our] modeling ... that Jupiter, and not Saturn, should eject the hypothetical third ice giant,\" Nesvorny said. Advertisement The new findings not only hold clues to how our own solar system evolved, but also the researchers noted that they could shed light on how other planetary systems may behave. \"Developing an intimate understanding of our own solar system, especially at times long before we were even around, has important implications for our understanding of exoplanetary systems and how they compare to us,\" Cloutier said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Robot Swarms Could Help Solve Our Lead Pollution Problems Scientists say tube-shaped microbots may be an effective and economical way to clean up our water. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post and Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 14, 2016, 05:24 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An illustration of a self-propelled \"microbot\" that could be used to capture, transfer and remove heavy metals from water. ACS Vast swarms of miniature robots are coming -- and they might be the answer to scrubbing our waters clean of lead. \"Microbots\" smaller than the width of a human hair could be highly effective and cost-efficient tools for removing lead and other contaminants from industrial wastewater, according to a new study published in the journal Nano Letters last month. Advertisement In the space of a single hour, the study showed, self-propelled microbots could remove up to 95 percent of lead from water. Lead is commonly found in wastewater from mines or factories that make batteries and electronic devices, and can pose a serious risk to public health, as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan demonstrates. Industrial activities can also contaminate water with arsenic, mercury and other metals. Heavy metal pollution can cost big cities billions of dollars a year, said Samuel S\u00e1nchez, co-author of the study and ICREA professor at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia in Spain. He added that current methods to remediate the pollution are either expensive or produce secondary waste. Advertisement S\u00e1nchez said his team envisions using the microbots \"for the pre-treatment of industrial wastewater before dumping into a river.\" At the moment, the bots aren't ready for open water, so they would swim in \"a controlled environment, such as small reservoirs, pipes, containers.\" This video shows how external magnets control microbots' trajectories. ACS The microbots are composed of three layers. The outer layer is made of graphene oxide to absorb heavy metals, while a middle layer made of nickel makes the microbots ferromagnetic so they can be steered by external magnets. A platinum inner layer reacts when hydrogen peroxide is added to the wastewater, producing a stream of oxygen micro-bubbles that the microbots eject to propel themselves in the water. Advertisement Once the bots finish their clean-up work, external magnets collect them for reuse. The heavy metal contaminants can also be recycled, making the process even more efficient. \"This technique is scalable, so we envision that small companies could use microbots to decontaminate their water in case they cannot afford bringing their waste water to decontamination plants,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"In my opinion, we should see first commercial use of self-propelled microbots in the next couple of years.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Scientists Unearth Fossils Of Rats The Size Of Small Dogs What researchers really find intriguing, though, is why they died out. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Nov 7, 2015, 12:24 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Come on... rats are pretty cute. Visuals Unlimited, Inc./Robert Pickett via Getty Images Musophobes , quit reading now. Archaeologists with the Australian National University have discovered the fossils of seven different species of giant rats, one of which could grow to be up to 10 times the size of the critters that scurry through New York City subways. \"The biggest one is about five kilos, the size of a small dog,\" Dr. Julien Louys of the ANU School of Culture, History and Language said Friday in a press release. Advertisement Archaeologists found the fossils in East Timor while working on a project examining early human movement in Southeast Asia. These fossils are around 44,000 years old, according to The Washington Post. Evidence suggest that humans, who lived in Timor as much as 46,000 years ago, would hunt and eat the mega-rats. It\u2019s not clear exactly when archaeologists first found the fossils, and ANU didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment from The Huffington Post. Researchers say one of the most interesting aspects of the rats is how scientists suspect they died out -- and the implications that could have for life today. Advertisement \"The funny thing is that [humans and rats] are co-existing up until about a thousand years ago. The reason we think they became extinct is because that was when metal tools started to be introduced in Timor, people could start to clear forests at a much larger scale,\" Louys said in the statement. He further explained the link between habitat destruction and extinction during an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Company. \"It\u2019s not the presence of human hunters using traditional weapons that's causing the extinctions of these giant rats,\" he said. \"It's actually this massive deforestation and land clearing. When you think there's actually similar things happening now in land areas in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, it's really important to keep in mind the effects of this deforestation might actually cause many more extinctions.\" Advertisement Contact the author at Hilary.Hanson@huffingtonpost.com Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Strange Fireball Explodes Over Bangkok Sky No, it's not an alien invasion. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Sep 8, 2015, 11:26 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Video recorded in Nonthaburi, Thailand , shows a mysterious explosion in the sky as motorists drive down a busy roadway. Thailand's Astronomical Society identified the flash as an extremely bright meteor called a \"bolide,\" according to the Sydney Morning Herald . Speculation surrounding the strange fireball included a downed aircraft, a shooting star, an alien invasion and an asteroid apocalypse. Advertisement The airborne explosion appeared around 8:40 a.m. on Monday, according to The Bangkok Post . The footage shows a small bright light streak across the sky for about two seconds before it explodes in a flash. The Bangkok Post reported that many people in different locations said they saw the fireball. Initial accounts noted that there were no reports of fallen aircraft or objects hitting the ground in Nonthaburi, a suburb of Bangkok. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Super-Intense Auroras Discovered On Strange Alien World Astronomers say the find may have big implications for the search for alien life. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jul 31, 2015, 09:37 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Chuck Carter and Gregg Hallinan/Caltech For the first time ever, the celestial light shows known as auroras have been detected outside our solar system . The auroras were detected not on an exoplanet but on a brown dwarf , one of a class of objects that are too big to be planets but too small to sustain the fusion reactions seen in stars. Advertisement Astronomers say the alien auroras probably look a lot like the auroras (Northern lights) seen here on Earth, only more reddish and much, much more intense. \"If you were able to stand on the surface of the brown dwarf we observed--something you could never do because of its extremely hot temperatures and crushing surface gravity--you would sometimes be treated to a fantastic light show courtesy of auroras hundreds of thousands of times more powerful than any detected in our solar system,\" Dr. Gregg Hallinan , assistant professor of astronomy at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif. and the leader of the international team of astronomers who made the discovery, said in a written statement. (Story continues below video.) Advertisement The brown dwarf that hosts the auroras is known formally as LSR J1835+3259 . It's located about 20 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra . Astronomers spotted the auroras with the help of optical telescopes and the Very Large Array , a powerful radio astronomy observatory located near Socorro, N.M. The discovery, which was described in a paper published in the journal Nature on July 30, brings astronomers' understanding of brown dwarfs into sharper focus. Advertisement \"We already know from observations of brown dwarfs that they have clouds in the atmosphere,\" Dr. Stuart Littlefair, an astrophysicist at the University of Sheffield in England, told the BBC. Now that we know brown dwarfs can have auroras, he added, \"it is yet more reason to consider brown dwarfs as scaled-up versions of planets rather than scaled-down versions of stars.\" What's more, the discovery that objects outside the solar system can have auroras may help fine-tune the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life. As Hallinan told The Huffington Post in an email, the presence of auroras on an exoplanet, for example, would suggest that it had a magnetic field capable of protecting it against violent solar storms (known as coronal mass ejections) unleashed by its host star. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LEAVE A COMMENT With the goal of harnessing the untapped potential of Iranian-Americans, and to build the capacity of the Iranian diaspora in effecting positive change in the U.S. and around the world, the Iranian Americans\u2019 Contributions Project ( IACP ) has launched a series of interviews that explore the personal and professional backgrounds of prominent Iranian-Americans who have made seminal contributions to their fields of endeavor. We examine lives and journeys that have led to significant achievements in the worlds of science, technology, finance, medicine, law, the arts and numerous other endeavors. Our latest interviewee is Bobak Ferdosi. Bobak Ferdowsi is the Fault Protection lead on the NISAR joint Earth observation mission with India at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His prior positions have included Launch, Cruise, Approach Engineering Lead and Flight Director on Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity, Science Planner on the Cassini mission, Flight Software Product Line System Engineer, and Europa Clipper Mission Planner. Advertisement Bobak earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2001 from the University of Washington and subsequently his Master of Science in the same area from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bobak has always wanted to find life elsewhere in our universe. He plays shortstop in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory softball league and usually rides his bike to work. Tell our readers where you grew up and walk us through your background. How did your family and surroundings influence you in your formative years? Advertisement I was raised by my Iranian dad and American mother in the East Bay Area in California. Then, I moved to Tokyo for a couple of years, where I lived with my paternal aunt. I think living in the Bay Area in a multicultural household, and then moving overseas, contributed heavily to a sense of belonging to a global community, and recognizing the wonderful things each culture brings to the table. There\u2019s little doubt in my mind that one reason I love space exploration is that it can be a unifying force and experience for humankind. What has been your personal key to success? What were the biggest inspirations for your career? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m really successful yet (I mean I am very fortunate to get to do this job), but I think it\u2019s mostly been trying to improve myself both personally and professionally. I was lucky in that my first job connected me with some wonderful career mentors, allowing me to gradually learn what I enjoy doing, what I want from a career, and not feel pressured into career moves. I didn\u2019t appreciate that building robots to visit other planets was a job until shortly after graduating from high school in 1997, I watched the Mars Pathfinder land. How did you end up working in the space program? And how did you get on the Mars Curiosity team? After Mars Pathfinder, my path was pretty straightforward. I started out thinking about majoring in Physics instead of Aerospace Engineering, and worked in a physics laboratory for most of my time at college (I still love physics). After graduating from the University of Washington, which had an Aerospace Engineering department, I went to MIT for a Masters in the same field. From there, I was very lucky that a friend and classmate of mine ended up working at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory first, and helped me get my job. Curiosity ended up being mostly happenstance \u2013 there was a job opening when I was hired, and I started on it part-time until transitioning to full-time after about a year. Advertisement You worked as a mission planner on NASA\u2019s first nuclear-powered Mars rover The Curiosity - one of the most technologically advanced mission to Mars yet. Could you tell our readers about the challenges of controlling a robot on Mars? Personally, a lot of the challenge was this was the first time for me. As an institution, JPL has landed a number of missions on Mars, and quite a few members of the team had prior experience doing so, so I tried learning from them what I could. More often than not, I learned how not to do things. Seems like most of our lessons learned tend to be \u201cthis didn\u2019t work so well, so let\u2019s try to do better next time,\u201d even in our biggest successes. Technically, one of the often-overlooked challenges (besides the complexity of such missions), is the time delay between Earth and the spacecraft / rover. At launch, the delay is seconds between command and the spacecraft acknowledgement, but by the time we reached Mars, that was 14 minutes round trip \u2013 the time it takes at the speed of light for our commands to get there, to execute, and then send back a response. Accordingly, we had to build in a lot of autonomy. There\u2019s no way to joystick a landing (or even operate it from day-to-day) with that delay, so the spacecraft and rover have to be able to execute things on their own without checking-in with humans. What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your career? Self-doubt. While I consider myself extremely fortunate to work here with such incredible people, the flip-side of that coin is that sometimes it\u2019s difficult to believe that I am at the same level. What advice would you give to students who want to take the same career path as you? Do it! It\u2019s a very satisfying career. Just remember it\u2019s not always easy, so learn to make connections with other people in the same boat. It\u2019ll help you be a better engineer (communication skills are crucial) and it\u2019ll help you when you\u2019re struggling. How can our readers stay current on what you\u2019re doing now? What are you exploring for the next few years? Advertisement I tweet a fair amount (@tweetsoutloud), but really there\u2019s so much more going on at NASA and so I strongly recommend following as many of the NASA-operated accounts on social media (I think we\u2019re on every major one nowadays). I personally enjoy NASA JPL\u2019s (@NASAJPL) the most, since it covers a lot of our robotic missions as well as Earth sciences that I\u2019m very proud of. As for me, I recently transitioned from what promises to be an incredible mission to Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, to a joint Earth science mission with India\u2019s space agency called NISAR. The opportunity to work with an international partner on a mission that can really impact our understanding of our world, led me there. What excites you most about the future of NASA? Well, I\u2019m always excited to visit places in our solar system or learn about exoplanets (always with the hope that we\u2019ll learn we\u2019re not alone in the universe), but one of the most exciting things to me is that the future of NASA and the space industry in general. There is the increasing collaboration with private industry and international partners. Hopefully, this will allow the next generation of missions to represent even more of the world than ever so more people can participate. Your hairdo got the attention of the whole world during the landing. How did you create that fabulous hair? Did you ever think you would become a meme? What was it like to become an instant celebrity? Advertisement Surreal. I don\u2019t think anyone goes into NASA thinking \u201cone day I\u2019ll be famous\u201d so I was caught off-guard. The emotions of the landing were a lot to deal with, but I was very fortunate that the team was supportive and I am really proud to help represent the project and agency that I care deeply about. My hair came from a tradition started a few years earlier of celebrating our major accomplishments with a different pattern in my hair \u2013 for example System Test 5 (our 5th major test of the vehicle here on Earth before launch) led to a Roman Numeral V on the side of my head. By the time of landing, everyone on our team knew I was going to do something, so my boss beat me to the punch, sending out a survey to the team to vote on what my hair should look like. What does being an Iranian-American mean to you? For me it means I feel like a global citizen. I\u2019m proud of both my heritages, but ultimately my allegiance is to helping to understand the context of what it means to be human and to help our planet and everyone on it. It\u2019s also a reminder to me that the future I want to see (and that I am trying to create) is one where we can better recognize we are all more the same than we are different. I think that the perspective of space is one powerful way to do that.

Hawking Warns We're Facing A Disaster In Next Thousand Or Ten Thousand Years But it doesn't have to be the end of humankind. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Jan 19, 2016, 02:10 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The progress of science and technology is creating \"new ways things can go wrong\" for humanity, according to British theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking. The University of Cambridge professor points to nuclear war, global warming and genetically-engineered viruses as increasingly significant threats humankind will face in the future. Advertisement \"Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand years,\" he told the BBC. Fortunately, the future doesn't have to be all doom and gloom. \"By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race,\" he said. Famous scientist Stephen Hawking warns that science and technology will create new threats against humanity. Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images Advertisement Hawking says that we will not establish colonies away from Earth for at least the next 100 years, making this period especially critical, according to The Guardian. \"We are not going to stop making progress, or reverse it, so we have to recognize the dangers and control them,\" Hawking added. \"I'm an optimist, and I believe we can.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Are Anxiety Drugs Making Us Less Eager To Lend A Helping Hand? Some scientists say possibly. Others aren't convinced. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jun 28, 2016, 06:28 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Antianxiety medications can be enormously helpful to people bedeviled by severe anxiety -- no doubt about that. But by tamping down anxious feelings, could it be that these so-called \"anxiolytic\" drugs are blunting our empathy and rendering us less willing to lend a helping hand to those in need? That's the word from the scientists responsible for a provocative new study showing that lab rats given a drug called midazolam (MDZ) were less willing than untreated control rats to help release a trapped cage mate. Advertisement \"With the MDZ on board, they were unable to feel/catch/'contage' the trapped rat's distress and thus were not motivated,\" Dr. Peggy Mason, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Chicago and the leader of the research, told The Huffington Post in an email. She called the finding \"really amazing,\" adding in a videotaped statement (above) that \"in the context of today's society, which is a highly medicated society, where lots of people are taking psychoactive drugs that might blunt their experience of negative affect, our results would suggest that that will also blunt helping.\" That sounds scary. But is it really the case? Dr. Norman Sussman, a professor of psychiatry at New York University Medical Center, isn't convinced. He said it's notoriously difficult to draw conclusions about humans from studies involving rodents or other animals. What's more, he said, midazolam is a powerful injectable drug that generally is used not for anxiety but as a sedative for surgical patients. Advertisement \"In every way you look at it, this study is not relevant to clinical experience,\" he said. \"There are too many questions about why it was set up this way. You can't draw very much from this at all.\" In the new study, drugged rats and non-drugged controls were given the opportunity to free a cage mate trapped inside a plastic tube. David Christopher For the study , which was published June 8, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, the researchers watched what happened when rats were placed inside a cage containing a rat trapped inside a clear plastic tube. Advertisement Untreated (control) rats were quick to open the door to the restraint to free the trapped rat. But rats injected with the midazolam made no effort to open the door even though they could see and hear their trapped cage mate. It wasn't that the rats on midazolam were physically unable to open the restraint door. When it was chocolate chips instead of another rat inside the tube, the drugged rodents had no trouble opening the door to get at the treat. It was that they simply didn't care that the other rat was trapped. Mason said the new research might lead people to rethink their choices when it comes to coping with anxiety. Advertisement \"One approach is to dull or dampen uncomfortable emotions and another approach is to learn to tolerate these unpleasant experiences,\" she said in the email. While drug therapy might be a good choice for people with crippling anxiety, others \"may want to take a different approach given this information.\" But Dr. Dolores Malaspina, another professor of psychiatry at NYU, sounded a different note. In an email to HuffPost Science, she said that even if certain medications do blunt empathy, \"suffering from an anxiety disorder has an even greater disruptive effect.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In any case, Sussman said, good medical care requires doctors to prescribe anxiolytic drugs only in the case of severe anxiety. Advertisement Whatever the takeaway from the new study, previous research suggests that psychiatric drugs may be messing with our empathy. The popular painkiller acetaminophen has been tied to a reduced ability to show empathy , and certain antidepressants have been linked to indifference . Whatever.

SeaWorld Doesn't Seem To Understand Its Business Is Over The world now knows wild animals should stay in the wild. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 9, 2015, 08:26 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Earl Gibson III via Getty Images The shift was sudden. One day, SeaWorld's bleachers were full. Many Americans held fond memories of watching killer whales belly-flop gallons of water onto the crowd, carry trainers on their heads across a tank and pose for fish amid a chorus of \"oohs\" and the snap of cameras. Some went home with dreams of becoming one of those wetsuit-clad animal lovers, working with the massive creatures day after day. Then, a trainer died , pulled underwater by one of her charges. The story of Dawn Brancheau's death made headlines in 2010, but it wasn't until Gabriela Cowperthwaite released the documentary \" Blackfish \" three years later that we realized those childhood aspirations were tainted. Advertisement The film cast a harsh light on the seemingly beautiful world orcas spent inside the theme park. Tanks turned into prisons, trainers into anguished captors. And the adoring audience, vicious conservationists. The so-called \"Blackfish effect\" led to an astounding 84 percent collapse in profits for SeaWorld, and attendance plummeted . But although the documentary was released more than two years ago, the park has been slow to acknowledge its own massive shortcomings. Promises to build a new, $100 million tank for its killer whales met sharp resistance from freedom-or-bust activists. The California Coastal Commission approved the plans but banned the breeding of captive whales, so the snazzy new cage was put on hold. And on Monday, SeaWorld San Diego finally announced its iconic orca shows would end sometime in 2017 , some four years after \"Blackfish.\" Advertisement \"We want to do something even better for the whales,\" executives said. But again, the promises reflect a company struggling to hang on to an outdated business. The jumping, fish-eating, trainer-carrying show will be replaced with a \" new orca experience , designed to take place in a more natural setting,\" The San Diego Union-Tribune notes. \"We start everything by listening to our guests,\" CEO Joel Manby told the Union-Tribune. \"They want experiences that are more natural.\" But to Manby, \"natural\" apparently still means artificial tanks rather than freedom. Slate notes the shows will take place in the same arenas with \"minimal\" spending to improve them. The whales will still jump, but they'll be \"natural\" leaps that don't appear to be tricks. And the other orca shows in Orlando and San Antonio won't be following suit. For them, the Shamu Show will go on. Advertisement SeaWorld has yet to release its third-quarter attendance and profit numbers, which would reflect the highly lucrative summer season. But the tides have already turned. The company's demise has been a long time coming, and those kids who used to dream of riding atop the mouth of an orca would now very much prefer to see them in the ocean. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Marcia Dunn Feb 23, 2021, 07:15 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The huge parachute used by NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover to land on Mars contained a secret message, thanks to a puzzle lover on the spacecraft team. Systems engineer Ian Clark used a binary code to spell out \u201cDare Mighty Things\u201d in the orange and white strips of the 70-foot (21-meter) parachute. He also included the GPS coordinates for the mission\u2019s headquarters at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Advertisement Clark, a crossword hobbyist, came up with the idea two years ago. Engineers wanted an unusual pattern in the nylon fabric to know how the parachute was oriented during descent. Turning it into a secret message was \u201csuper fun,\u201d he said Tuesday. Only about six people knew about the encoded message before Thursday\u2019s landing, according to Clark. They waited until the parachute images came back before putting out a teaser during a televised news conference Monday. It took just a few hours for space fans to figure it out, Clark said. Next time, he noted, \u201cI\u2019ll have to be a little bit more creative.\u201d Advertisement \u201cDare Mighty Things\u201d \u2014 a line from President Theodore Roosevelt \u2014 is a mantra at JPL and adorns many of the center\u2019s walls. The trick was \u201ctrying to come up with a way of encoding it but not making it too obvious,\u201d Clark said. As for the GPS coordinates, the spot is 10 feet (3 meters) from the entrance to JPL\u2019s visitor center. Another added touch not widely known until touchdown: Perseverance bears a plaque depicting all five of NASA\u2019s Mars rovers in increasing size over the years \u2014 similar to the family car decals seen on Earth. Advertisement Deputy project manager Matt Wallace promises more so-called hidden Easter eggs. They should be visible once Perseverance\u2019s 7-foot (2-meter) arm is deployed in a few days and starts photographing under the vehicle, and again when the rover is driving in a couple weeks. \u201cDefinitely, definitely should keep a good lookout,\u201d he urged. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Isabel Debre \u2014 Associated Press Feb 9, 2021, 11:45 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 A spacecraft from the United Arab Emirates swung into orbit around Mars on Tuesday in a triumph for the Arab world\u2019s first interplanetary mission. Mission controllers at the UAE\u2019s space center in Dubai announced that the unmanned craft, called Amal, Arabic for Hope, reached the end of its nearly seven-month, 300-million-mile journey and began circling the red planet, where it will gather detailed data on Mars\u2019 atmosphere. Advertisement The orbiter fired its main engines for 27 minutes in an intricate, high-stakes maneuver that slowed the craft enough for it to be captured by Mars\u2019 gravity. After the engine firing, it took a nail-biting 15 minutes or so for the signal confirming success to reach Earth. Ground controllers rose their feet and broke into applause. Tensions were high: Over the years, Mars has been the graveyard for a multitude of missions from various countries. Two more unmanned spacecraft from the U.S. and China are following close behind, set to arrive at Mars over the next several days. All three missions were launched in July to take advantage of the close alignment of Earth and Mars. Advertisement Amal\u2019s arrival puts the UAE in a league of just five space agencies in history that have pulled off a functioning Mars mission. As the country\u2019s first venture beyond Earth\u2019s orbit, the flight is a point of intense pride for the oil-rich nation as it seeks a future in space. An ebullient Mohammed bin Zayed, the UAE\u2019s day-to-day ruler, was on hand at mission control and said: \u201cCongratulations to the leadership and people of the UAE for the indescribable joy of the arrival at Mars.\u201d About 60% of all Mars missions have ended in failure, crashing, burning up or otherwise falling short in a testament to the complexity of interplanetary travel and the difficulty of making a descent through Mars\u2019 thin atmosphere. Advertisement A combination orbiter and lander from China is scheduled to reach the planet on Wednesday. It will circle Mars until the rover separates and attempts to land on the surface in May to look for signs of ancient life. A rover from the U.S. named Perseverance is set to join the crowd next week, aiming for a landing Feb. 18. It will be the first leg in a decade-long U.S.-European project to bring Mars rocks back to Earth to be examined for evidence the planet once harbored microscopic life. If it pulls this off, China will become only the second country to land successfully on Mars. The U.S. has done it eight times, the first almost 45 years ago. A NASA rover and lander are still working on the surface. Advertisement For the UAE, it was the country\u2019s first venture beyond Earth\u2019s orbit, making the flight a matter of intense national pride. For days, landmarks across the UAE, including Burj Khalifa, the tallest tower on Earth, glowed red to mark Amal\u2019s anticipated arrival. This year is the 50th anniversary of the country\u2019s founding, casting even more attention on Amal. The celestial weather station aimed for an exceptionally high Martian orbit of 13,670 miles by 27,340 miles (22,000 kilometers by 44,000 kilometers). It was set to join six spacecraft already operating around Mars: three U.S., two European and one Indian. Advertisement Amal had to perform a high-stakes series of turns and engine firings to maneuver into orbit and achieve what has eluded so many before. \u201cAnything that slightly goes wrong and you lose the spacecraft,\u201d said Sarah al-Amiri, minister of state for advanced technology and the chair of the UAE\u2019s space agency. The success represents a tremendous boost to the UAE\u2019s space ambitions. The country\u2019s first astronaut rocketed into space in 2019, hitching a ride to the International Space Station with the Russians. That\u2019s 58 years after the Soviet Union and the U.S. launched astronauts. Advertisement In developing Amal, the UAE chose to collaborate with more experienced partners instead of going it alone or buying the spacecraft elsewhere. Its engineers and scientists worked with researchers at the University of Colorado, the University of California at Berkeley and Arizona State University. The spacecraft was assembled at Boulder, Colorado, before being sent to Japan for launch last July. The car-size Amal cost $200 million to build and launch; that excludes operating costs at Mars. The Chinese and U.S. expeditions are considerably more complicated \u2014 and expensive \u2014 because of their rovers. NASA\u2019s Perseverance mission totals $3 billion. The UAE, a federation of seven skeikhdoms, is looking for Amal to ignite the imaginations of the country\u2019s scientists and its youth, and help prepare for a future when the oil runs out. Advertisement \u201cThis mission was never about just reaching Mars,\u201d said Omran Sharaf, Amal\u2019s project manager. \u201cMars is just a means for a much bigger objective.\u201d ____ Associated Press writer Malak Harb contributed to this report.

The work by Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson makes it possible to image proteins and other molecules after freezing them rapidly to preserve their shape, providing a powerful new tool for medical research. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s like frames in a movie. Each of these pictures represents a frame and they can be put together into a movie and we can see what the molecules do,\u201d said Peter Brzezinski, a member of the Nobel committee for chemistry. BREAKING NEWS The 2017 #NobelPrize in Chemistry is awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank & Richard Henderson. pic.twitter.com/RUZSnArJHO \u2014 The Nobel Prize (@NobelPrize) October 4, 2017 The new approach fills a previously blank space by generating images of everything from the surface of the Zika virus to proteins that cause antibiotic resistance or are involved in Alzheimer\u2019s. Advertisement The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the $1.1 million prize, said the technology had moved biochemistry into a new era. By freezing biomolecules mid-movement, scientists can unravel previously unseen processes - a major advance both for basic understanding and the potential development of new drugs. Scottish-born scientist Henderson used an electron microscope to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at an atomic resolution, showing the potential of the technology. Advertisement Until then, electron microscopes were only seen as suitable for imaging dead matter, because the powerful electron beam destroyed the biological material. His breakthrough was further developed by German-born scientist Frank, a U.S. citizen, while Dubochet of Switzerland used rapidly frozen water to preserve the natural shape of the biomolecules. Frank said cryo-electron microscopy had \u201cimmense\u201d potential for medical research, which is increasingly focused on processes inside cells, but it would take time for this to play out - and he was taken aback by news of the award. Advertisement \u201cI was overwhelmed. I thought the chances of winning a Nobel prize were miniscule,\u201d he told a news briefing by telephone.

Advertisement \u201cThe three of us who have been awarded the prize are sort of acting on behalf of the whole field,\u201d he told a news conference in Cambridge, England. Understanding the structure of proteins and working out how they interact in the body should spark fresh approaches to drug development, just as earlier advances had produced today\u2019s multibillion-dollar biotech drugs, he added. \u201cIn a few years, maybe five years, we might know most of the structures ... it\u2019s quite an exciting time,\u201d Henderson said. Advertisement Indeed, cryo-electron microscopy is already delivering results, such as the recent discovery of the structure of tau protein filaments in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It was also put to work last year in the fight against Zika, when the mosquito-borne virus was linked to an epidemic of brain-damaged babies in Brazil. As alarm about the outbreak spread, scientists were able to generate three-dimensional images of Zika at the atomic level, jump-starting the search for potential drugs and vaccines. Advertisement \u201cThe use of these methods has completely revolutionized structural biology so everyone now wants to buy this type of equipment and start this type of research, all over the world,\u201d Johan Aqvist, another Nobel committee member, told Reuters. U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific is a leading supplier of cryo-electron microscopy instruments. Chemistry is the third of this year\u2019s Nobel Prizes after the winners of the medicine and physics prizes were announced earlier this week. The prizes are named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace, in accordance with his will. Advertisement While the chemistry award has sometimes been overshadowed by the towering reputations of physics winners such as Albert Einstein, laureates include ground-breaking scientists such as radioactivity pioneers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie, though she also won the physics prize. The award passed over one of the highest-profile fields of research, the so-called CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology that earlier this year allowed U.S. scientists to alter genes in a human embryo to correct a disease-causing mutation. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Infant' Alien Planet Discovery Shakes Up Ideas About How Worlds Form Astronomers say 'K2-33b' is just 5 million to 10 million years old. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jun 27, 2016, 12:52 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Astronomers have found what they say is the youngest fully formed exoplanet ever seen, and it's shaking up ideas about how planets form. \"This discovery is a remarkable milestone in exoplanet science ,\" Erik Petigura, a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech in Pasadena, California, and coauthor of a paper about the finding, said in a written statement. The discovery, he said, could help explain the origins of Earth \"and eventually the origin of life.\" Advertisement More than 3,000 exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) have been found to date, and just about all are believed to be at least a billion years old. But the newly identified exoplanet, a body roughly six times the size of Earth that's located about 470 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpio , is just 5 million to 10 million years old. \"You might think of it as an infant ,\" Trevor David, an astronomer at Caltech and the paper's lead author, said of the exoplanet in a written statement. And age isn't the only thing unusual about K2-33b, as the exoplanet has been dubbed. It's locked in an extremely tight orbit around its host star. How tight? K2-33b is roughly 10 times closer to its star than Mercury, the innermost planet of our solar system, is to the sun. Advertisement This diagram shows the K2-33 system and its planet K2-33b as compared to our own solar system. The planet is nearly 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the sun. NASA/JPL-Caltech The fact that such a young exoplanet is so close to its star is surprising, because astronomers had theorized that it takes much longer than 5 million to 10 million years for a star's gravitational forces to pull a planet into such a tight orbit. Or as Petigura told The Huffington Post in an email, K2-33b \"is inconsistent with a whole class of theories that predict planets migrate on timescales of hundreds of millions or billions of years.\" So what does explain the infant exoplanet? There are a couple of possibilities, according to David: K2-33b could have been tugged inward rapidly by the very disk of gas and dust from which it formed (a process known as disk migration), or it could have formed in its current location (a process called \"in situ\" planet formation). Advertisement \"The implication is that now both disk migration and in situ formation have more evidence for support,\" David said via email. \"The slower migration scenario that we ruled out might still be relevant in some cases, but we can at least say that it is not the only way to produce a close-in planet.\" Petigura added: \"No single discovery is going to answer all our questions about how the earth formed, but as we find more young planets we'll get a clearer picture of how planet formation proceeds in general, which is important for understanding the formation of the earth and the origin of life.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The National Weather Service Is About To Leave Its LOUD Forecasts In The Past The agency is ending its reliance on the caps lock key. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 12, 2016, 06:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The National Weather Service has used all caps since 1849, when forecasters issued weather reports via teleprinters. Mark Newman via Getty Images The National Weather Service is making a change 167 years and many well-oiled caps lock keys in the making. The forecasting agency announced Monday it will begin releasing weather warnings in standard mixed-case characters , ending the tradition of issuing standard updates in all caps. Advertisement BEGINNING ON MAY 11, @NOAA \u2019S NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE FORECASTS WILL STOP YELLING AT YOU. https://t.co/4YjdvUdWxj pic.twitter.com/SAgbtUMMEp \u2014 NWS (@NWS) April 11, 2016 The weather service began its all caps tendencies in 1849 \"when weather reports were sent by 'the wire' over teleprinters,\" the NWS said in a statement. The teleprinters were only able to use upper case characters and the standards were not updated when the agency switched to modern technology. Past efforts to adopt mixed-case messages throughout the 1990s failed to gain widespread acceptance. However, amateur weather forecasters experiencing some angst over the more pleasant tone need not fear. The NWS will still release some all caps messages during \"extremely dangerous situations\" and during forecasts with \"international implications.\" Advertisement Light rain on Thursday, however, will cease to be apocalyptically emphasized \"LIGHT RAIN ON THURSDAY.\" The change will go into effect on May 11.

Sorry, But Your Cat Really Doesn't Need You Around New research shows felines don\u2019t feel much for their owners. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Sep 7, 2015, 09:06 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A grumpy Persian domestic cat. A new study suggests that domestic cats don't rely on their owners for safety and security. Hulya Ozkok What does your cat think of you? Maybe not too much. A new study suggests that cats don't need their owners to feel secure and safe -- the way dogs do -- but rely on them mostly as a reliable source of food. Womp, womp. \"Animal-human relationships may be built on different priorities--for dogs clearly safety and security are important, but this is not the case in cats,\" Dr. Daniel Mills, professor of veterinary behavioral medicine at the University of Lincoln in England and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"It seems cats are much more resource focused... I\u2019m sure you know someone whose cat moved in with their neighbor who started to feed it (rather than offered it shelter and protection).\" Advertisement The study was patterned on a classic psychology experiment known as \" strange situation ,\" so named because in the experiment -- developed by American-Canadian psychologist Mary Ainsworth (1913-1999) -- a baby or child is left in a room to play by the mother or caregiver while a stranger then walks in. The experiment is modeled to help scientists gauge how attached children are to their mothers. Similarly, the researchers placed 20 pet cats in an unfamiliar room and then observed how they responded when they were left alone in the room with a stranger, their owner, or simply by themselves. The researchers selected cats whose owners said were particularly attached to them, Live Science reported. What did the researchers find? The cats vocalized slightly more meows when their owners left them in the room with a stranger, but the researchers didn't notice any additional evidence to suggest that the cats were strongly attached to their owners. Advertisement \"This vocalization might simply be a sign of frustration or learned response, since no other signs of attachment were reliably seen ,\" Mills said in a written statement. \"In strange situations, attached individuals seek to stay close to their carer, show signs of distress when they are separated and demonstrate pleasure when their attachment figure returns, but these trends weren\u2019t apparent during our research.\" The study was published online in the journal Plos One on September 2, 2015.

AP Jan 29, 2021, 08:06 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Johnson & Johnson\u2019s long-awaited vaccine appears to protect against COVID-19 with just one shot \u2013 not as strong as some two-shot rivals but still potentially helpful for a world in dire need of more doses. J&J said Friday that in the U.S. and seven other countries, the single-shot vaccine was 66% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness, and much more protective \u2014 85% \u2014 against the most serious symptoms. Advertisement There was some geographic variation. The vaccine worked better in the U.S. \u2014 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 \u2013 compared to 57% in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus . \u201cGambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile,\u201d Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&J\u2019s Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press. With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts had been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters. Advertisement But with some other competing vaccines shown to be 95% effective after two doses, at question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff to get more shots in arms quickly. The company said within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light. These are preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn\u2019t completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination \u2013 about the time when, if participants were getting a two-dose variety instead, they would have needed another shot. Advertisement After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died regardless of whether they were exposed to \u201cregular COVID or these particularly nasty variants,\u201d Mammen said. When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness. Defeating the scourge that has killed more than 2 million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots being rolled out in different countries so far all require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95% protective after the second dose. But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection. Advertisement All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spikey protein that coats it. But they\u2019re made in very different ways. J&J\u2019s shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along. Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and to use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna. Advertisement It\u2019s not clear exactly how well the AstraZeneca version, being used in Britain and several other countries, works. Tests in Britain, South Africa and Brazil suggested two doses are about 70% effective although there are questions about how much protection older adults get. An ongoing U.S. study may provide more information. J&J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40% had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV. J&J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other COVID-19 shots such as fever that occur when the immune system is revved up. Advertisement While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other COVID-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated \u2013 and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used. J&J had hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine, which is still underway. Friday\u2019s interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89% effective in a U.K. study and that it also seems to work \u2014 though not as well \u2014 against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Moon Holds Much More Water Than Previously Believed Scientists have confirmed for the first time the presence of water on the moon\u2019s sunlit surface. AP Oct 26, 2020, 04:19 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The moon\u2019s shadowed, frigid nooks and crannies may hold frozen water in more places and in larger quantities than previously suspected. And for the first time, the presence of water on the moon\u2019s sunlit surface has been confirmed, scientists reported Monday. That\u2019s good news for astronauts at future lunar bases who could tap into these resources for drinking and making rocket fuel. Advertisement While previous observations have indicated millions of tons of ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the moon\u2019s poles, a pair of studies in the journal Nature Astronomy take the availability of lunar surface water to a new level. More than 15,400 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) of lunar terrain have the capability to trap water in the form of ice, according to a team led by the University of Colorado\u2019s Paul Hayne. That\u2019s 20% more area than previous estimates, he said. The presence of water in sunlit surfaces had been previously suggested, but not confirmed. The molecules are so far apart that they are in neither liquid nor solid form, said lead researcher Casey Honniball, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Advertisement \u201cTo be clear, this is not puddles of water,\u201d she stressed at a news conference. NASA\u2019s astrophysics director Paul Hertz said it\u2019s too soon to know whether this water \u2014 found in and around the southern hemisphere\u2019s sunlit Clavius Crater \u2014 would be accessible. The surface could be harder there, ruining wheels and drills. These latest findings, nonetheless, expand the possible landing spots for robots and astronauts alike \u2014 \u201copening up real estate previously considered \u2018off limits\u2019 for being bone dry,\u201d Hayne said in an email to The Associated Press. For now, NASA said it still aims to send astronauts to the lunar south pole, especially rich in frozen water. The White House deadline is 2024. Advertisement As for the shadowed areas believed to be brimming with frozen water near the moon\u2019s north and south poles, temperatures are so low that they could hold onto the water for millions or even billions of years. These so-called cold traps get down to minus 261 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 163 degrees Celsius). Using data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the researchers identified cold traps as small as a few yards (meters) across and as wide as 18 miles (30 kilometers) and more, and used computer models to get all the way down to micrometers in size. \u201cSince the little ones are too small to see from orbit, despite being vastly more numerous, we can\u2019t yet identify ice inside them,\u201d Hayne said. \u201cOnce we\u2019re on the surface, we will do that experiment.\u201d Advertisement For the second study, scientists used NASA\u2019s airborne infrared observatory Sofia to conclusively identify water molecules on sunlit portions of the moon just outside the polar regions. Most of these molecules are likely stored in the voids between moon dust and other particles or entombed in the glassy residue of of micrometeorite impacts. In this way, the molecules can withstand the moon\u2019s harsh environment, scientists said. By flying 45,000 feet (18 kilometers) above Earth, the Sofia plane is above the water vapors that can interfere with infrared observations. For now, Sofia can analyze only the moon\u2019s outermost surface, but these water molecules could be buried yards (meters) deep, Honniball noted. As a comparison, the Sahara desert has 100 times the amount of water than what Sofia detected in the lunar soil. Advertisement Scientists believe all this water on the moon came from comets, asteroids, interplanetary dust, the solar wind or even lunar volcanic eruptions. They\u2019ll have a better idea of the sources \u201cif we can get down on the surface and analyze samples of the ice,\u201d Hayne said. Jason Bleacher, chief scientist for NASA\u2019s human exploration and operations office, said at some point decisions will need to be made regarding lunar technology. Will it be easier to survive the extremely cold polar environments and tap into deep shadowed craters for water, he asked, or to dig into the moon at the milder middle latitudes in search of water. \u201cI can certainly envision ways that robots might be beneficial in all of those,\u201d Bleacher said. NASA plans to launch a water-seeking rover named Viper to the moon\u2019s south pole by the end of 2022. Astronauts would follow in a series of missions intended to set up long-term bases. The space agency wants its new Artemis moon-landing program to be sustainable, unlike the Apollo program a half-century ago.

Physics Is Totally This Cat's Meow The law of cat-servation of momentum. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Jul 31, 2015, 05:41 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT If you name your cat after a celebrated scientist, don't be surprised if it suddenly spurns balls of yarn and decides to chase a deeper itch, one scratched only by the pursuit of knowledge. For instance, this cat -- who happens to be named Hubble, presumably an ode to the celebrated astronomer -- is awfully close to discovering the secret to perpetual motion. All it needs is just bit more catnip to really get it going. Sure, it doesn't count as a closed system when there's a cat involved, just don't tell that to Hubble.

Africa's Golden 'Jackals' Not Jackals At All, Scientists Say The newly discovered African golden wolf is the first newfound canine in Africa in 150 years. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 31, 2015, 03:35 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have long considered the \"golden jackals\" of East Africa and the jackals seen across Eurasia to be of the same species. But a new DNA study shows that we've gotten these cunning canines all wrong. According to the study, the animals are distinct species -- and the African \"jackals\" aren't jackals at all but wolves. Dubbed Canis anthus , or the African golden wolf, this is the first new species of canid -- the biological family that includes dogs, wolves, coyotes, as well as jackals -- discovered in Africa in 150 years. \"Consistent with two previous studies also based on mitochondrial sequences, we find that golden jackals from Africa and Eurasia are not each other\u2019s closest relative as we would expect if they were the same species,\" Dr. Klaus-Peter Koepfli, a researcher at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., and the study's lead author, told The Guardian. Advertisement (Story continues below.) The African golden wolf is on the left and the golden jackal of Eurasia is on the right. The two were previously thought to be of the same \"golden jackal\" species. D. Gordon E. Robertson & Eyal Cohen (via UCLA) For the study, the researchers derived the evolutionary history of both the African and Eurasian animals by analyzing golden jackal DNA samples and extensive genomic data in both the jackals and gray wolves. They noticed that African golden jackals (now considered to be the African golden wolf) split from their gray wolf and coyote ancestors around 1.3 million years ago. Eurasian golden jackals diverged some 600,000 years earlier -- and the two species\u2019 mitochondrial DNA differs by up to 6.7 percent , Science magazine reported. Advertisement \"One of the main takeaways of our study is that even among well-known and widespread species such as golden jackals , there is the potential to discover hidden biodiversity and that such discoveries are made even more possible by using data sampled from whole genomes,\" Koepli told Reuters. The researchers think that scientists previously mistook African and Eurasian golden jackals for the same species because they shared many physical traits, including the shapes of their skulls and teeth . That sounds reasonable, but not all scientists are convinced. Previous research by Dr. Philippe Gaubert, a biologist at the University of Montpellier in France suggested that African golden jackals are a subspecies of gray wolf that's separate from the Eurasian jackal. He told National Geographic that he stands by his original work -- and isn't yet convinced that the African golden wolf is a new species . Advertisement \"There's still a lot of work to be done,\" he said. But Dr. Greger Larson, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Oxford in England, voiced his support of the scientists behind the new study. \"They have phenomenal data and they do a nice series of analyses,\" he told National Geographic. \"It's a super airtight case.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Democratic Candidates Stand Up For A Little Idea Called Science Watch Bernie call out The Donald for his climate change \"theory.\" By Casey Williams On assignment for HuffPost Jan 18, 2016, 01:31 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT On climate change, the Democrats' message is clear: We believe in science. During the Democratic primary debate on Sunday , the presidential candidates seemed to take pleasure in distancing themselves from their science-doubting Republican counterparts. The Democratic candidates used a question from the popular YouTube channel MinuteEarth to attack the Republicans' skepticism. Watch the video (above) of the question and the candidates' responses. Advertisement Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) began by laying out the facts. \"The debate is over,\" he said. \"Climate change is real.\" In typical Bernie fashion, he then pivoted to criticize the influence of money in politics. Next he lunged for the easy target: Donald Trump. \"It is beyond my comprehension how we could elect a president of the U.S., somebody like Trump, who believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese,\" Sanders said. Advertisement Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley picked up on that last point, praising the \"Democratic stage, where we actually believe in science.\" He pushed his plan to move the country to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, which is perhaps the most ambitious climate change proposal from any of the presidential candidates. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who battled with Sanders for airtime all night, didn't get a chance to respond. But her platform shows that she, too, is down with science. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
