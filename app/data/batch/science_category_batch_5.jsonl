Scientists Reveal The Secret Key To Charisma If you can think on your feet, a new study suggests that you're in luck. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Dec 5, 2015, 04:44 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists may have just have figured out how charisma -- that indefinable quality of people who can captivate a room -- works. Charisma may rely on quick thinking, according to new research. In other words, people who can respond speedily to general knowledge questions or tasks tend to be seen as more charismatic by their friends. Advertisement \"We had expected mental speed to predict charisma, as speed seemed like a critical underlying component to people\u2019s capacity to be interesting -- and even a little unpredictable -- in social interaction,\" Dr. Bill von Hippel, the lead researcher and a professor of psychology at the University of Queensland in Australia, told the Huffington Post in an email. \"But we were surprised to find that speed was more important than IQ in predicting charisma.\" The researchers recruited groups of friends, which included 417 people total, to take rapid-answer tests intended to measure their mental speed. Then, each person reported how charismatic their other friends in the group were and each took an IQ test. After comparing the IQs, mental speeds, and charisma ratings, the researchers found that mental speed could accurately predict charisma, whereas IQ could not. The researchers concluded that mental speed may allow an individual to mask inappropriate reactions and to be humorous on the spot, allowing for the person to be seen as charismatic. Advertisement \"Social intelligence is more than just knowing the right thing to say,\" Hippel said. \"It\u2019s also the capacity to say it in a timely fashion.\" The research was published in the journal Psychological Science on Nov. 30.

English King Henry I Could Be Buried Under A Parking Lot, Researcher Says Another English King Could Be Buried Under A Parking Lot Reuters May 22, 2015, 05:16 AM EDT LONDON (Reuters) - Just three years after the extraordinary discovery of King Richard III under a car park, researchers think another medieval English monarch might be found buried beneath a parking lot and are hoping to find him. Philippa Langley, the inspiration behind the successful hunt for Richard III's remains, is now on the trail of his forebear Henry I, one of the first rulers of England following the Norman conquest in the 11th Century. Advertisement She is part of a team seeking backing to search for the ruins of Reading Abbey, founded by Henry in 1121 and where he was buried after his death 14 years later, allegedly brought about by eating too many lampreys, a type of fish. Like Richard, the exact whereabouts of Henry's final resting place is unknown after the abbey, including his tomb, was mostly destroyed some 400 years later. \"The thinking in Reading, using current estimates of the size of the abbey, is that this burial spot is located beneath a school,\" Langley told BBC History Magazine. Advertisement \"If the abbey is larger, it could be situated underneath either what is today a playground or a car park.\" The discovery of the body of Richard III, the last of the Plantagenet dynasty and the last English king to die in battle in 1485, under a council car park in Leicester, central England, is considered one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of recent British history. His body was re-buried in Leicester Cathedral in March at a somber ceremony which attracted global interest. Advertisement Richard was depicted by Shakespeare as a deformed tyrant who murdered his own nephews, one of whom was the rightful king. This view is challenged by Langley and the Richard III Society who say he was the victim of propaganda after his defeat in battle by Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII. Likewise, Henry I has a chequered reputation. The fourth son of William I, who conquered England in 1066, he came to the throne in 1100 after his brother William II died in a suspicious hunting accident, gaining a reputation as a sometimes cruel ruler. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Failing a Class for Good Tife Odumosu didn't sit down and immediately draw the perfect cartoon. He started drawing and iterated into his more finalized sketch. Some strokes of his pencil improved his work and others did not. Is this failure? I don't think so. By Tim Chartier, Contributor Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science, Davidson College & Chief Researcher, Tresata Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science, Davidson College & Chief Researcher, Tresata Feb 2, 2015, 01:34 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Think of one of your favorite classes. What's come to mind? For some, learning certain content is memorable. For some, the classroom environment can be remembered in detail - working in groups, the nature of discussion, experiencing student-led learning. For others, a class that connects to future employment is important. And maybe, for some or possibly even many, it's a combination of these and other parts of a class. But, what about learning to fail? That could seem like more of a nightmare than a pleasant and important remembrance of a class. I've been teaching at Davidson College for over a decade and, increasingly, I hope my students learn, yes, to fail. I hope they pass my class but also that they learn to fail and grow by doing so. Do I facilitate uncomfortable, frustrating courses? In fact, many students comment on how they enjoy the courses and approach. How? It's important to understand what I mean by failing. Let me summarize this concept with the following image, drawn by a studio artist and math student at Davidson College. Advertisement The artist's name is Tife Odumosu. I see his drawing as a visual representation of one method to effective learning. Tife didn't sit down and immediately draw the perfect cartoon. He started drawing and iterated into his more finalized sketch. Some strokes of his pencil improved his work and others did not. Is this failure? I don't think so. But, taken in another context, it could be seen as so. I teach math, where the odd problems often have answers in the back of the book. Life rarely comes, outside such a class, with answers in the back of the book. You check your answers in the future with outcomes that result from your choice. Learning math shouldn't by marked by those occasions when someone gets a correct answer. What about those times you must redo your work? As you iterate in your work, what might you learn about your tendencies? How might you improve for the next time, even if you do it incorrectly once again? In fact, in some areas of mathematics there is no right answer. Advertisement I'd like more people to trust their own ideas and learn to patiently make imperfect attempts as they observe their thoughts evolving. To encourage this type of thinking, I'm leading a Massive Open Online Course, often called a MOOC, through DavidsonX , which is a partnership between Davidson College and edX. The course comes in two parts with part one launching in late February. The topic is applications of linear algebra generally in the context of computer graphics or data mining. Let's see an application in graphics. A pixel in a color image can be stored with three values representing the red, blue, and green intensities of the corresponding pixel. Each value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 means no red and 255 means the full intensity of red in the corresponding pixel in the image. Simple enough. Now, let's use equations for lines to alter an image. Remember, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept of a line? Here, x will be the red, blue, or green intensity in a pixel in an image. Then, y will equal the new intensity. Choosing m and b and applying this to color intensities allows us to recolor an image with linear equations. For example, we might take m = -1 and b = 255 forming y = -x + 255. This would turn a value of 255 (full intensity of red) to 0 (no red) in the corresponding intensity value of a pixel. Advertisement Let's give the Mona Lisa a mathematical make-over. We simply need equations for the red, green and blue intensities in the image. Then, we'll apply this to every pixel in the image and have your new image. I'll take (new red pixel) = (old red pixel) - 80 (new green pixel) = -0.75(old green pixel) + 150 (new blue pixel) = -0.5(old blue pixel) + 200 Here is what results. Is that what you expected? I didn't know exactly what to expect. I had a certain idea but also simply had to run the program to see. Like Tife drawing his cartoon, I simply tried and saw what I got. Then, I adjusted my attempts, learning from what I'd done and iterating to what I wanted. At times, my iterations were based on mathematical calculations. Other times, I mathematically doodled, in a sense, with numbers. So, soon, my MOOC will launch and we'll see what participants from around the world do with this and other similar exercises. For those ready to explore the ideas offline and outside a MOOC, there is also my book, When Life is Linear: From Computer Graphics to Bracketology . It covers related topics. Advertisement To close, I'll share what I tell my students with increasing frequency each year: Look not only for where you succeed but where you believe that you didn't. It is here that you can learn how you learn, how you achieve, and what challenges you. You can learn to trust your thoughts. For this, I share a paraphrasing of Albert Einstein's article Education for Independent Thought ; this quote appears in the one-man play Walking Lightly: A Portrait of Albert Einstein by Len Barron. The purpose of education is to nurture thoughtfulness. The lesser function of thinking is to solve problems and puzzles. The essential purpose is to decide for oneself what is of genuine value in life. And then to find the courage to take your own thoughts seriously. In our education, we should learn to stand in the unknown and wait - for what? You don't know. Will the answer come? Often. But not always. Will the image match your expectations? If not, try again and see what you learn. When you simply don't know, stand there, for it is when you stand - not knowing, that the answer may come. Here I share words by William S. Burroughs: Your mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer. And yes, I want students to try and make attempts and learn from them. For this, I share a quote by Thomas J.

Watch One Of The World's Largest Lakes Shrink Before Your Eyes Going, going, nearly gone. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Sep 2, 2016, 01:40 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The Aral Sea used to be the world\u2019s fourth-largest lake, but it has been reduced to two relative puddles. NASA shared a time-lapse video on Thursday that shows the original Aral Sea shrinking , starting in the year 2000. It has become two separate, much smaller bodies of water: the North and South Aral Seas. Advertisement The lake has suffered since the 1960s, when the Soviet Union diverted two major rivers that supported the lake \u2014 the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya \u2014 to irrigate agricultural fields in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The aftermath, as described by NASA, was nothing short of devastating: As the Aral Sea has dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides. The blowing dust from the exposed lakebed, contaminated with agricultural chemicals, became a public health hazard. The salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields, degrading the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water. The loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier. In July, Al-Jazeera reported on a small bright spot in the efforts to restore the North Aral Sea . The 2005 Kokaral dam construction project, financed by the World Bank, had led to 15 kinds of fish returning to the waters. A second phase of the dam project is slated to keep restoring the North Aral.

This Astronaut Is Going To Run The London Marathon In Space Tim Peake will attempt the course virtually as he orbits the Earth at about 17,000 miles per hour. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Dec 4, 2015, 09:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Next year's London Marathon will be out of this world. As more than 37,000 runners hit the streets of the English capital on April 24, 2016, British astronaut Tim Peake will run the race virtually, while strapped to a treadmill on the International Space Station. Peake, 43, will cover the 26.2 miles while orbiting the Earth at approximately 17,000 miles per hour , according to a YouTube video posted by event sponsors Virgin Money on Friday. Advertisement Using a special treadmill video app , Peake will be able to see how far he's run and exactly where he is on the marathon route at any given time. H is progress will be charted by a virtual reality avatar wearing an astronaut suit , Virgin Money said in a press release. The former British Army helicopter pilot last ran the London Marathon in 1999 and finished in 3 hours and 18 minutes , according to the Evening Standard. He is not expecting to beat that time in space , however. Advertisement \"I don't think I'll be setting any personal bests. I've set myself a goal of anywhere between 3:30 to 4 hours,\" Peake said, according to the Virgin Money press release. He said one of the biggest challenges of the race would be the harness system. \"In microgravity I would float if I didn't strap myself down to the treadmill, so I have to wear a harness system that's a bit similar to a rucksack,\" he said in the video. \"That has to provide quite a bit of down force to get my body on to the treadmill, so after about 40 minutes, it gets very uncomfortable.\" Really excited to be running the Digital Virgin Money #LondonMarathon 2016 from space, in support of @PrincesTrust https://t.co/XUlFKlv7Qb \u2014 Tim Peake (@astro_timpeake) December 4, 2015 Advertisement Peake is the first Briton chosen by the European Space Agency for a mission on the ISS, and launches into space for his 6-month mission from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on Dec. 15. During the race, he will be monitored by a medical team at the European Astronaut Center in Cologne, Germany, which is preparing him for his return to Earth eight weeks later. Race director Hugh Brasher said he hoped Peake would inspire more children to explore science and space. Advertisement NASA's Sunita Williams ran the Boston Marathon on the ISS in 2007 , according to Space.com. She later completed a triathlon in space in 2012.

Women Scientists' Academic-Hiring Advantage Is Unwelcome News for Some: Part 3 The bane of every researcher is the critic who says a study is actually about some question it was never designed to answer -- then proceeds to demean the study for failing to answer the question it never asked. By Wendy M. Williams, Contributor Professor of Human Development at Cornell University and Founder/Director of Cornell Institute for Women in Science Professor of Human Development at Cornell University and Founder/Director of Cornell Institute for Women in Science May 18, 2015, 03:35 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Stephen J. Ceci and Wendy M. Williams Cornell University In Part 3 of this series, we respond to more comments about our April 13, 2015 article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . ( link ) We studied the wrong question The bane of every researcher is the critic who says a study is actually about some question it was never designed to answer -- then proceeds to demean the study for failing to answer the question it never asked. Critics chided us for not asking different questions than the one we did ask: Instead of studying hiring bias, they argued, we should have examined bias in tenure, remuneration, bullying, chilly climate, and persistence. ( link and link ) We agree that bias independent of hiring is important. In 2014, we and our colleagues published a 47,000-word monograph, describing hundreds of analyses examining claims of gender bias both before and after hiring--in pay, promotion, persistence, and job satisfaction, in eight STEM fields. ( link ) Advertisement In the current research, however, we studied entry-level hiring which, when coupled with this prior work, illuminates why women are underrepresented in certain fields of science but not others. We wrote: \"Although the point of entry into the professoriate is just one step in female faculty's journey at which gender bias can occur, it is an extremely important one.\" ( link ) We believe hiring is a very reasonable career point to address in view of our work on other aspects of bias. Despite the claim that hiring is biased against women, we found no evidence of this for fields in which women are most underrepresented -- engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics, and economics. After our findings were published, a chorus of critics asserted that everyone already knew this and that bias against women occurs at time points other than hiring. This assertion is a denial of the numerous allegations of hiring bias, some of which we cited. (Readers can search \"Wenneras and Wold hiring bias against women\" for many more examples.) For example, onebadbint said: \"As to whether there is gender discrimination in hiring in academia and elsewhere, come on! This is well documented in Virginia Valian's book Why So Slow which reviews the many many studies which show how changing the gender on an application gets fewer offers, lower salaries, and so on.\" ( link ) Advertisement Some critics feel we should have studied the entire professional career of academic scientists: \"W&C focus specifically on hiring for Assistant-level tenure-track positions. Their data don't tell us about hiring for other kinds of positions (lectureships, senior hires, etc.), nor do the data tell us about promotion decisions, publication biases, salary issues, micro-aggressions, chilly atmospheres, and, of course, explicit harassment.\" ( link ) \"The study only discusses tenure-track hires, not work environment (which qualitative work still suggests might be unwelcoming for women in STEM), senior appointments, mentoring etc.\" ( link ) We and our coauthors from economics have published our findings on gender differences in salary, tenure, promotion, job satisfaction, persistence, etc. Thus, it is unclear why critics assail us for not studying these issues again. Our current research on the hiring process is one piece of the larger puzzle, albeit an important one in view of claims of bias. No amount of retrofitting by critics can deny that hiring bias was alleged to be commonplace before we presented findings to the contrary, and no one in touch with current work in the field can deny that we have published extensive analyses of gender differences in multiple aspects of academic careers. The results from our current five experiments (and multiple validation studies) converged on the conclusion that women are preferred in tenure-track STEM hiring--but not because they are stronger than men, as some have opined. Predictably, some people do not welcome our findings. But they are real and they match what happens in real-world hiring (as described in the large-scale audit data we cite in our article, which shows that when women apply for real-world assistant professorships, they are usually more likely to be hired than men). Because these real-world data were not experimental, it was argued that women's hiring advantage was due to women being stronger candidates: \"Perhaps the women who survive training in a field where they have few mentors and surmount barriers most men may have little knowledge of, might actually be better. At least we cannot assume they aren't.\" ( link ) Advertisement This common assertion is precisely why we did the current experiments--to test the claim of female superiority as being the driver of female hiring advantage. We made the male and female candidates equally strong, and women were still preferred by faculty. So it is unlikely that female superiority is the reason women are hired at a higher rate in the real-world. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Self-selection bias in our data A number of posters and bloggers have taken us to task for what they perceive as a self-selection bias. In the words of Dr. Zuleyka Zevallos, an applied sociologist: \"Williams and Ceci say they have addressed self-selection bias of their sample by conducting two control experiments...In effect the study design does not simulate the conditions in which hiring decisions are made. Instead, participants self-selected to participate in a study knowing they'd be judging hypothetical candidates.\" ( link ) Advertisement However, our control for self-selection went far beyond studies she cites as counterevidence. We began by reporting that demographics (gender, type of institution, and discipline) were similar between respondents and nonrespondents. The blogger never mentions this check on self-selection. Next, as this blogger notes but criticizes as a weak selection check, we paid a subsample of 90 psychologists and 82 of them complied (91% response rate); their data resembled in every way the data from psychologists in the main sample who were not paid, thus suggesting that as one approaches total population parameters the preference for female applicants remains strong. Adding this step can only strengthen our study, notwithstanding unsupported claims that psychologists could infer the purpose of the study. Next, we went on to provide a third self-selection check the blogger also fails to note: We used national polling techniques to rule out effects of self selection. (Interested readers should consult the Supporting Information online, which describes the sample weighting procedure we used to ensure the generalizability of findings.) Our sample-weighting procedure involved adjusting for the responses and nonresponses from 2,100 faculty solicited to be in our experiments. We tallied the women and men in each of the home departments of these 2,100 faculty and then calculated sample weights based on these counts (e.g., a woman sampled from an engineering faculty of 50, 10 of whom were female, would have her voting weight adjusted both for how many women and for how many total people were in her department, as well as for how many departments of its type were in the U.S. as a whole). These sample weights allowed us to examine the effect of nonresponding individuals in each of the 24 strata: 2 genders x 4 fields x 3 types of institutions. If self-selection was a factor, it would have changed the outcome when the analyses were re-run using sample weights to control for nonresponse. But the results did not change. The irony of this criticism about our alleged failure to check on self-selection is that we went far beyond any previous experiment on gender bias in hiring, by using national-polling-type sample weights to control for response and nonresponse rates in each subgroup of our sample. Advertisement In Part 4 of our response to critics we will examine allegations that we (a) have a right-wing agenda to overturn affirmative action, (b) control the journal that published our findings, (c) escaped the normal peer review process, and (d) sifted through comments, responding only to those made by men.

Vera Rubin, Astronomer Who Discovered The First Direct Evidence Of Dark Matter, Dead At 88 She used galaxies\u2019 rotations to discover the first direct evidence of dark matter in the 1970s while working at the Carnegie Institution in Washington. Reuters Dec 27, 2016, 04:55 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The Washington Post via Getty Images (Reuters) - Vera Rubin, a U.S. astronomer who pioneered work on invisible dark matter in the universe and who some colleagues felt was overlooked for a Nobel Prize, has died at 88, her son said on Monday. Rubin died on Sunday at an assisted living facility in Princeton, New Jersey, and had suffered from dementia for several years, Allan Rubin, a geosciences professor at Princeton University, said in an email. Advertisement Rubin, a Philadelphia native, used galaxies\u2019 rotations to discover the first direct evidence of dark matter in the 1970s while working at the Carnegie Institution in Washington. Working with spectrograph designer Kent Ford, Rubin found that material at galaxies\u2019 edges rotated at the same rate as material in the center. The discovery contradicted a law of physics that said the greater mass in the center, such as dust, stars and gas, meant it should move faster than the edge, where there was less mass. The explanation was a halo of dark matter around the galaxies that spread mass throughout the galaxies. Dark matter has not been directly observed but has been inferred through work by Rubin and other astronomers and physicists. Advertisement Scientists have discovered that a small part of dark matter is made of neutrinos - tiny, fast-moving particles that do not really interact with regular matter. Oh no! A giant has passed. Great Astronomer Vera Rubin who discovered dark matter. RIP pic.twitter.com/g8BI2gZOBh \u2014 David Grinspoon (@DrFunkySpoon) December 26, 2016 Emily Levesque, an astronomer at the University of Washington, told Astronomy Magazine in June that Rubin deserved the Nobel Prize since the discovery of dark matter had revolutionized astronomy and the concept of the universe. Advertisement The will of Alfred Nobel, the founder of the prizes, \u201cdescribes the physics prize as recognizing \u2018the most important discovery\u2019 within the field of physics. If dark matter doesn\u2019t fit that description, I don\u2019t know what does,\u201d Levesque said. #VeraRubin 's work deserved a Novel Prize. But her as a person? She made science kinder & the culture of research more human. https://t.co/TOLv7j6B5u \u2014 Mika McKinnon (@mikamckinnon) December 27, 2016 Rubin graduated from Vassar College in 1948 with a degree in astronomy. She earned a master\u2019s degree from Cornell University and a doctorate from Georgetown University in Washington. Advertisement She was the second female astronomer to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences and received the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton in 1993. Rubin was on the Georgetown faculty before working at the Carnegie Institution. Don't shoot for the stars, we already know what's there. Shoot for the space in between because that's where the real mystery lies. \u2014 Vera Rubin (@rubin_vera) February 4, 2016 Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

RIP Toystory, The Bull Who Was Daddy To 500,000 Offspring Bull Who Sired 500,000 Offspring Dies By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 27, 2015, 11:59 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Who's the biggest daddy of them all? Ismail Ibn Sharif, who took the throne as the king of Morocco in 1672, is said to have fathered more than 1,000 children , making him one of the most sexually prolific men of all time. But Ibn Sharf pales in comparison to another famously fertile father. His name was Toystory, and he wasn't a man but a 2,700-pound, record-breaking bull that is believed to have sired more than half a million offspring before his death late last year . Advertisement (Story continues below image). The average dairy bull produces about 20,000 progeny in a lifetime , U.S. Department of Agriculture researcher Paul Vanraden told the Associated Press in 2006. Vanraden told HuffPost in an email this week that the number may now be even lower, as breeders today tend to use younger bulls for breeding purposes and replace them more frequently. So how exactly did Toystory produce 500,000 offspring to become one of the most prolific bulls ever? It all boils down to a combination of today's globalized cattle breeding techniques and Toystory's own special physiology. Toystory, who was named after the animated film, possessed an \u201cunmatched\u201d ability to produce semen, the bull's owner, Wisconsin-based Genex Cooperative, told The Huffington Post. In fact, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, the animal usually produced sperm nine times a week , which is \u201cabout twice the average of other bulls at Genex.\u201d Advertisement Moreover, Toystory's sperm had a high fertility rate and the offspring he produced were usually handsome, healthy and excellent milk producers -- making the sperm desirable to breeders around the world. Over the years, the bull's semen has been shipped to more than 50 countries, including Germany, Japan and Italy. A little bit of semen goes a long way -- about 1/20th of a teaspoon is considered one \"unit.\" Over his lifetime, Toystory, who was born in 2001, is said to have produced 2.4 million units, each of which sold for between $15 and $60. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Toystory surpassed the previous world record of 1.7 million units held by a Dutch bull named Sunny Boy in 2011. Advertisement Dairy bulls that produce more than a million units in a lifetime are extremely rare. In the industry, these animals are known as the \u201cmillionaires club,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cToystory reached a level of semen production that might never occur again in history,\u201d a Genex executive said in a written statement. \u201cWith the genetic progress possible in the dairy cattle industry today, through technologies such as bull evaluations based on genomics, it is very possible that no other bull will ever surpass his record.\u201d Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Songbird's Secret Dancing Skills Seen For First Time In Stunning Slow-Mo The moves are so fast they can barely be seen with the human eye. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Dec 3, 2015, 09:26 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Want to see some impressive tap dancing? Just watch songbirds woo each other. An international team of researchers recently captured incredible slow-motion footage of the blue-capped cordon bleu's courtship behavior. The clip above shows two birds bobbing and singing -- which scientists have long known they do -- and reveals a dance that hasn't been seen before , National Geographic reported. \"We thought that we found a secret, as we had been puzzled by the fact that only cordon-blues (but not other Estrildid finches) made conspicuous sounds when hopping,\" said Dr. Masayo Soma, a co-author of the research published last month in Scientific Reports and an associate professor at Hokkaido University in Japan. Advertisement Soma and her colleagues used a high-speed camera to analyze the courtship displays of 16 blue-capped cordon bleu songbirds . They discovered that both male and female birds appear to \"tap dance,\" and that their dancing increases in speed when a bird they're trying to mate with is perched nearby. The motions are so fast that they can't be seen by the naked human eye. The researchers concluded that the tap dancing may add attractive sounds to the birds' courtship displays, or possibly send secret signals to another bird. Advertisement \"Usually in songbirds, complex acoustic features were preferred as sexual signals. So, cordon-blues may add sounds using their feet,\" Soma said. \"Another idea is that signals that can be conveyed by multiple modalities are efficient. Tap dancing can serve as auditory, visual or tactile signal.\" Courtship display in blue-capped cordon-bleus. (a) When blue-capped cordon-bleus perform courtship display, (b) they simultaneous bob and step, and (c) sing at certain times. Hokkaido University The researchers noted that more studies are needed to better understand how the singing, bobbing and dancing behaviors are all coordinated. Advertisement \"We still do not know why only cordon bleus show tap dancing and other related birds do not perform it,\" Soma said. \"It is even more surprising that both males and females possess the same behavioral features, given that generally males are more ornamented and show more exaggerated sexual displays.\" Dr. Will Allen, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Hull in England who was not involved in the research, told BBC News the newly discovered tap dancing is a \"very cool behavior\" but that he was keen to see it explored in more detail. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Advertisement \"What's new here is that there's a passerine species -- a songbird -- that is duetting in both song and dance,\" he added. \"This study is an important first step, but we don't know whether the receiver prefers mates that display these dancing movements, or even that the receiver is sensitive to them. There are some suggestions here that they might, but without an experimental-type design, we can't work that out.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

A Debate On The Pros And Cons Of Aging And Death A Debate On The Pros And Cons Of Aging And Death By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Dec 24, 2016, 04:43 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

At age 74, I have already experienced many of the indignities of aging and before very long will also confront the inevitability of death. Although neither prospect is particularly pleasant, I strongly believe in the normality and necessity of both. Claims that science will soon prevent aging and dramatically prolong life strike me as irresponsible hype and false hope. I am all for efforts to expand our healthspan, but see little value in prolonging our lifespan, and little possibility that we will soon discover a fountain of youth. My grandson, home from college for Christmas break, disagrees with what he regards as my sentimental and regressive attachment to the status quo. Tyler is participating in stem cell and genetics research and believes that it is feasible and desirable to double the human lifespan and make aging just another curable disease. Tyler has no qualms about this research and regards my doubts as technically naive and ethically unnecessary. Here is a very brief point by point summary of our ongoing debate. Me: Evolution requires aging and death to make room for each new generation and also favors a fairly rapid succession of generations. Both are necessary to provide raw material for the variability and beneficial mutations essential to natural selection. Advertisement Tyler: Evolution has little interest in aging and death. Natural selection focuses its selective pressure on producing optimal reproductive fitness in the mating members of any species. Once the period of reproduction and weaning have passed, natural selection applies much less pressure on how the rest of the lifespan plays out. There is thus no inherent evolutionary reason to prohibit research that would prevent aging and prolong life. And there are excellent reasons to pursue it- although evolution does a remarkable job when given enough time, it works far too slowly and imperfectly to help us solve our current problems. Whenever, in the past, it has served our interests, humans have always felt free to speed up natural selection. We would still be hunters and gatherers were it not for the artificial selection of domesticated plants and animals that constituted the agricultural and pastoral revolutions. If we have the genetic tools to promote human health, longevity, and happiness, why not use them. Me: But the world is already terribly over-populated and is rapidly becoming even more over-populated. Extending the lifespan will mean more crowding, more mouths to feed, more environmental degradation, and more resource depletion. Malthusian dynamics ensure that providing a longer life for some must be purchased at the high cost of a more brutal life for the many- a life threatened by even more wars, migrations, famines, and epidemics. Advertisement Tyler: Overpopulation is best solved by reducing birthrates. This has already been done with great success almost everywhere in the world except Africa and the Middle East. It will be a better, more mature, and healthier world if people live longer and have fewer diseases and fewer children. A longer lifespan will make people wiser, more future oriented, and less willing to take foolish risks in the present. This could lead to more rational decisions on how best to preserve our planet as a decent place to live. Me: Only the rich will be able to afford new products that prevent aging and promote longevity. The resulting caste system based on lifespan will be even more unfair than our current divisions based on wealth and power. Tyler: The distribution of benefits that will accrue from aging research is a political, economic, and ethical question, not a scientific one. Given human nature and existing institutional structures, the benefits will almost certainly be enjoyed in a markedly unequal and unfair fashion- greatly favoring the rich and powerful, with only a very slow trickle down to the population at large. This inequity has accompanied every previous technological advance in the long march of human progress and is not specifically disqualifying to progress in slowing aging and death. Advertisement Me: Every scientific advance can, and usually does, have harmful, unintended consequences (medical, social, political, economic) that cannot possibly be predicted in advance. Scientists always have intellectual and financial conflicts of interest that bias them to exaggerate the potential benefits to be derived from their discoveries and to minimize the potential risks. Tyler: Surely, aging research will have its hype, blind alleys, and unexpected complications- these are an unavoidable risk in all scientific advances. But the risks and difficulties should not paralyze efforts to make the advance or call into question whether it should be made; instead, they should increase caution and vigilance in how it is done. And we must remember the context. Our world is already going to hell in a handbasket- the risks of advancing science are real, but the potential benefits may be all that stand between us and disaster. Science is necessarily disruptive, but may offer our only road to salvation. To quote Mark Watney in the movie 'The Martian': \"In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option, I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this.\" Me: There is something arrogant and unseemly about tampering with anything so fundamental to life as aging and death. Their inevitability has always been an essential element governing the ebb and flow of all the species and all the individual organisms that have ever lived on our planet. Why assume that we have the right, or the need, to tamper with such a basic aspect of nature? Advertisement Tyler: Scientific progress has always challenged conservative values based on a sentimental attachment to the past. My grandfather would probably have worked hard to convince the first agriculturalists that they were breaking some sacred and natural code when they chose to settle down in one place rather than continue following the hunt. There is no inevitable, inexorable, over-riding, and natural law defining and governing one correct path of human destiny. Me: Curing disease is the primary goal of medical science. But aging is not a disease- it is an entirely expectable wearing down, an expression of biological entropy that cannot be reversed. We should certainly target the diseases that occur in old age in an effort to extend the average human healthspan. Success will improve the well being of the elderly and have a small subsidiary effect on lifespan- eg, more people living into their 80's, 90's, and 100's. But we should not expect that better treatment for diseases will allow people to live to biblical ages. Despite the hype to the contrary, there is no reason to believe it is scientifically feasible or ethically desirable for people to stay young for 150 years. The most compelling lesson of scientific research is that the body is far more complicated and intricately balanced than we could possibly imagine. We are still at a very early stage in curing disease- there is no reason to think we can prevent decline or postpone death. Tyler: It is far too early to tell whether aging in humans is more a reversible disease or an inescapable degenerative process. But since aging is caused by biochemical processes, it most likely can be prolonged by biochemical interventions. We can't decide the question based on values and reasoning- only by actually doing the aging research will we learn whether aging is preventable. And sure it may take many decades, but that's precisely why we have to allocate the resources now to get the project off to a fast start. Me: Unrealistic promises result in false incentives and misallocated resources. Typical example: we are investing a vast fortune on the wildly unrealistic goal of eliminating dementia within a decade or two, while taking dreadful care of the people who are already actually demented. Less hype would result in better balance between our hopes for the future and fulfilling our responsibilities in the present. Tyler: Aging is already a pressing current issue and will soon become the biggest medical problem of our future. There is no running away or putting our head in the sand. My goal is to make life longer and better for people. Sure, there are some aging researchers who are overly enthusiastic in promoting their research and in promising quick results. And we mustn't neglect the many practical problems of people who are aging today on the false hope that science will quickly and magically come to their rescue. We must find a proper balance between research investments that will pay off only in the distant future and current health care investments for those who are in need today. The future of our species depends on how we handle our demographics. The way ahead is difficult and uncertain- but that has never stopped us before. We make lots of mistakes along the way, but science helps us correct them. There is no standing pat- if we don't move forward, we will move backward. Advertisement My Reflections On The Debate There is a disturbing myth from ancient Greece. Aurora, the immortal goddess of the dawn, falls so deeply in love with a mortal man that she cannot accept losing him to death. She pleads successfully with the Olympian gods to grant him immortality, but forgets to request that he also be gifted with perpetual youth. Her human lover Is thus punished with the worst of fates- interminable life, daily made more intolerable by progressive aging and deterioration. Jonathan Swift illustrated the same chilling issue in Gulliver's Travels and also tragically in his own long, tortured, and undignified death from dementia. Modern medicine has cursed an increasing percentage of our aging population to suffer this miserable fate- an artificially prolonged life preventing a natural and peaceful death. Medicine is, so far, much more advanced in keeping elderly people alive than in keeping them well. Our goal should be enhanced health, not a longer existence if that existence is painful and has lost all meaning. Medicine should help people live well, but also let them die peacefully and with dignity. Advertisement Tyler is much more optimistic than I that we will soon have the technical means to prolong youth and postpone death- and that we should use them. I am more accepting of the limits of life- eager to improve its quality, rather than expecting to extend its duration. Tyler trusts scientists to make scientific decisions. I believe that scientists have conflicts of interest that make them uniquely unqualified to judge the ethical implications of the scientific opportunities open to them. If scientists can do something, they will do it- fairly heedless of unintended consequences. Tyler has the optimism and enthusiasm of the young. I have the pessimism and caution of the old. In a final flourish, Tyler trumped my argument that aging and death are somehow natural to the evolutionary scheme of things with the paradox that evolution has also given us the power to control aging and death and that surely we are programed to use it. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I don't think our debate will be settled on ethical or theoretical grounds. History provides precious few examples of a society voluntarily rejecting the application of a powerful new technology- e.g., China burning its navy in the fifteenth century; Japan banning guns in the seventeenth. But both were closed societies whose conservative decisions were governed by internal political concerns; they were much less responsive than ours to economic and scientific competition and pressure. Advertisement My guess is that scientists will be given the freedom and the funding to follow every possible path to the fountain of youth and to doubling the lifespan. If they succeed, some chosen few of humanity will enjoy great benefits, while the masses may suffer even more than they do today and our environment may decay even faster than it already has. But I find aesthetic comfort in the firm belief that the scientists won't be able to deliver on their extravagant promises. Although our knowledge base is increasing exponentially, the more we learn about the body, the more we appreciate how difficult it is to translate basic science into clinical application. Our bodies are remarkably complex and carefully balanced machines. Scientists can tinker with them, but I suspect that the basic cycle of life and death will be very hard to change.

Witness Accounts In Manhattan Hammer Attack Show The Power Of False Memory Hammer Attack Spotlights The Power Of False Memory By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 15, 2015, 11:08 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Medical technicians tend to David Baril, who was shot and wounded by police after he pulled a hammer from a bag and lunged at officers who approached him on the street near New York's Penn Station on Wednesday, May 13, 2015. Baril, 30, is suspected of attacking four people with a hammer earlier in the week. (AP Photo/Raj Mathura) The real world of our memory is made of bits of true facts, surrounded by holes that we Spackle over with guesses and beliefs and crowd-sourced rumors. On the dot of 10 on Wednesday morning, Anthony O\u2019Grady, 26, stood in front of a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. He heard a ruckus, some shouts, then saw a police officer chase a man into the street and shoot him down in the middle of the avenue. Moments later, Mr. O\u2019Grady spoke to a reporter for The New York Times and said the wounded man was in flight when he was shot. \u201cHe looked like he was trying to get away from the officers,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Grady said.

LEAVE A COMMENT Science progresses because of passionate and audacious individuals who are unafraid to ask questions, answers to which influence how we live our lives and view the world. We lost many of these brilliant minds in 2016. Logo for WikiEd Year of Science Around this time of each year one tends to take stock of things that happened through the year. While you\u2019re doing the maths for your personal life, news outlets prepare lists of all the notable and noteworthy events that occurred that year. This includes lists of prominent individuals who have died, categorized by the fields in which they were prominent. So you find lists of musicians, actors, writers, even politicians who died that year, published in non-speciality publications. In other words, outlets like Vanity Fair are not the only publishers of lists of actors who died \u2014 even The New York Times and less prominent local news outlets publish these lists. Advertisement To be sure, these individuals left an indelible mark and made a difference to scores of casual viewers/listeners and even connoisseurs, but it has never failed to surprise me how little ink is devoted to scientists who have also left their mark on this world. While scientific publications do devote vital space for these obituaries, if conventional non-science media also wrote about the passing of scientists it would be one small step in the direction of making science a more accessible professional option. This year there has been much discussion on the unusually large number of celebrity deaths, and as I write this there is news of George Michael\u2019s passing . One reason attributed to this larger number is because we\u2019re at a time when pop culture icons who flourished in the 1960s are now well past their 70s, and some having lived a hedonistic life have died earlier than others. And while we deeply regret their passing, we are able to look back and reflect on their impressive repertoire and the lives they touched through their works. Through these reflections and obituaries available from innumerable outlets, there are many who are only now introduced to that impressive repertoire, and it\u2019s not uncommon that an artiste gains new followers upon their passing. Scientists by and large are unfortunately not afforded the same level of publicity \u2014 not during their lives, nor when they die. Even Nobel laureates remain in the public eye at best in early October when the Prizes are announced, and December when the ceremonies occur. How many people will be able to name the 2016 Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, or physiology and medicine? And how many will be able to name the 2016 Nobel laureate in literature? I reckon the ratio will be 100:1 in favor of remembering the literature laureate, irrespective of whether you are familiar with Bob Dylan\u2019s repertoire. Advertisement The scientists we lost this year made discoveries and influenced their fields to such an extent that not just their own research, but also that of their peers has affected our lives. While many prominent scientists died this year, a case in point would be the passing of Roger Yonchien Tsien . Roger Tsien, Nobel Prize Laureate for Chemistry 2008, at a press conference at the Swedish Academy of Science in Stockholm. (Wikipedia) Tsien, along with his co-awardees Osamu Shimomura and Martin Chalfie, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry, \u201c for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP\u201d . GFP or green fluorescent protein is protein found in jellyfish, that is small enough to be engineered to be attached to cellular proteins without disrupting their activity to any appreciable extent. This pathbreaking technology has been adopted in almost every life science laboratory, and has enabled the development of a variety of biosensors. Using these biosensors, our understanding of brain development and morphology has outpaced previous efforts. In fact GFP based biosensors have been used to study every organ and the results have provided a basis for a deeper understanding of many diseases. Including cancer . And it is only when we understand diseases that we can move to developing cures and arresting them. Advertisement Susan Lindquist transformed our understanding of how protein folding shapes biological systems. She has made ground-breaking contributions in genetics, cell biology and biochemistry, using organisms as diverse as fungi, fruit flies, mustard plants, and mammals.

Susan Lindquist was another visionary scientist who died this year. From cancer. In a profile by The Scientist published in January 2016, Lindquist said \u201cI like to do high-risk and high-payoff kind of research. And I had a gut feeling that MIT was a cool place to be with people who are fearless.\u201d Her area of research was studying how proteins fold within a cell, and the cellular machinery recruited to shepherd the process of folding as well as folded proteins across the cell. Elucidating these steps is critical to understanding why these processes are disrupted in a number of diseases. Her research was also pivotal in enhancing our understanding of prion biology. While this article is not intended to supply an exhaustive list of scientists who died in 2016, it is an effort to raise the question of why mention of scientists\u2019 contributions when they die, is restricted to obituaries alone; and how integrating scientists in lists of deceased celebrities is important if we intend to give science its due place in society. By promoting the accomplishments of scientists if not through the course of their lives, at least in their deaths, we will not only give them their due but also acquaint the public with the importance of their discoveries, and the critical need to continue to fund basic scientific research. This would be a good time to think about this as we wind down this Wikipedia Year of Science .

At Least Global Warming Is Good For Someone! Study finds rising temperatures benefit Alaskan snowshoe hares and possibly moose -- but don't get too excited. By Arin Greenwood Animal Welfare Editor, The Huffington Post Dec 3, 2015, 12:40 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT John Luke via Getty Images Climate change appears to be causing whole island nations to sink beneath the sea . Polar bears may be headed the way of the dodo . There's even a theory that global warming thinks it'd be fun to mess up more than just the natural world -- and is also responsible for an increase in terrorist activity . Advertisement But a paper published in the journal Global Change Biology reveals climate change's cutest winners. Arctic ecologist Ken Tape and his co-authors make the case that snowshoe hares and moose in Alaska seem to be benefitting from the Earth's rising temperatures. \"Warming and expanded shrub habitat is the most plausible reason for recent snowshoe hare establishment in Arctic Alaska,\" they write. \"The establishment of snowshoe hares and other shrub herbivores in the Arctic in response to increasing shrub habitat is a contrasting terrestrial counterpart to the decline in marine mammals reliant on decreasing sea ice.\" The proposed mechanism is this: rising temperatures have led to earlier springs in northern Alaska. These have led to longer growing seasons, which means bigger shrubs. Advertisement Bigger shrubs, in turn, mean snowshoe hares have more places to hide and eat. That's resulted in the cute little critters appearing in parts of Alaska where they hadn't previously been seen. Other herbivores, like moose, are thought to be similarly affected. In the 1800s, \"there were no snowshoe hares or moose in the Alaskan tundra,\" Tape told The Huffington Post. Records show that moose came in the 1930s, followed by snowshoe hares in 1977, \"both following their shrub habitat northward,\" he said. \"We showed that the warming increased the height of shrubs, and those taller shrubs made it possible for snowshoe hares, and probably moose, to inhabit the region.\" Advertisement Snowshoe hares and moose aren't the only species finding the global warming glass half full, though some others might not provoke much enthusiasm. Yay, deer ticks, red imported fire ants and some \"agricultural pests\" also stand to gain from this rather apocalyptic nightmare. And, sorry, Tape says not to read too much joy into his research, either. On the one hand, snowshoe hares are undeniably cute, and moose are hunted and harvested, which puts food on the table for a lot of people in Alaska. \"So more moose would be positive in that sense,\" Tape said. \"Another view is that endemic tundra species could get squeezed out as shrubs overgrow their previously open tundra habitat, or as boreal species outcompete tundra specialists for forage.\" Advertisement H/T Wildlife.org Also on HuffPost: Get in touch with HuffPost's animal welfare editor at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Scientists May Have Discovered A Critical Key To Predicting Volcanic Eruptions KA-BOOM! Scientists Find New Trigger Of Volcanic Eruptions By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 17, 2015, 12:57 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An international team of researchers has discovered a previously unknown trigger of volcanic eruptions -- a finding that could give scientists a leg up on predicting blow-ups and saving lives. \"Understanding the triggers for volcanic eruptions is vital for forecasting efforts, hazard assessment and risk mitigation,\" Dr. Janine Kavanagh, a volcanologist at the University of Liverpool in England and the leader of the team, said in a written statement. \"With more than 600 million people worldwide living near a volcano at risk of eruptive activity, it is more important than ever that our understanding of these complex systems and their triggering mechanisms is improved.\" For their research, the scientists built a volcano model using a tank filled with jelly. They injected colored water into the tank to mimic ascending magma and then observed how the materials behaved using a high-speed camera and synchronized laser. Advertisement (Story continues below.) Video of the experimental model showing the colored water as ascending \"magma\" in the tank of jelly. (Credit: Janine Kavanagh/University of Liverpool) What happened? The researchers noticed a surprising drop in pressure when the ascending \"magma\" stalled to spread out horizontally along its journey to the surface of the tank -- geologists call this horizontal formation a \"sill.\" It turns out that the drop in pressure can cause the magma to behave like a buoyant foam, since magma often has gas dissolved in it. And that's when the drama begins. Advertisement \u201cA pressure drop can drive the release of dissolved gases, potentially causing the magma to explode and erupt,\u201d Prof. Sandy Cruden, professor of tectonics and geodynamics at Monash University in Australia and another member of the team, said in the written statement. \u201cIt\u2019s similar to removing a cap from a bottle of shaken fizzy drink -- the pressure drop causes bubbles to form and the associated increase in volume results in a fountain of foam erupting from the bottle.\u201d But the million-dollar question remains: Does this new finding point to a reliable way to predict potentially dangerous volcanic eruptions? Possibly. A horizontal sill and rapid pressure drop could serve as a warning that an eruption is on its way. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

According to reports, when Jackson got back to the visitor's sideline after the play, he commented on what he thought was an under inflated ball. The New England Patriots hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship Game at Gillette Stadium. (Photo by Jim Davis/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) The New England Patriots have been under fire amid allegations that 11 of the 12 balls they used in their AFC Championship Game win were inflated significantly below the NFL\u2019s requirements. While the league has yet to rule on whether the Patriots cheated their way to the Super Bowl\u2014both coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady denied any wrongdoing Thursday\u2014science can give us some answers.

'Strong Signal' From Another World Might Not Be Aliens After All Signal detected by SETI researchers could have come from someplace much closer to home. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Aug 30, 2016, 04:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Turns out that \u201cstrong signal\u201d from an alien world 95 light years away may not have been a strong signal or even from an alien world. Researchers involved in the search for signs of life on other worlds are downplaying the discovery, which was made last year by the RATAN-600 radio telescope in Zelenchukskaya, Russia, but only recently revealed. Advertisement The signal appeared to originate from the vicinity of HD 164595, a star roughly the size of our own sun in the constellation Hercules. The team that discovered the signal didn\u2019t claim it was proof of alien life, but called for \u201cpermanent monitoring\u201d of HD 164595 , Paul Gilster wrote on the Centauri Dreams blog. Although the discovery will be discussed at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Sept. 27, SETI researchers aren\u2019t showing much enthusiasm about the signal. Advertisement \u201c I was unimpressed ,\u201d Eric Korpela, an astronomer with Berkeley SETI, wrote on the organization\u2019s website. \u201cSomeone will look at it with Arecibo , and we\u2019ll be along for the ride. And I\u2019ll check the SETI@home database around that position. And we\u2019ll all find nothing. It\u2019s not our first time at this rodeo, so we know how it works.\u201d They\u2019re not saying it\u2019s aliens, but signal traced to sunlike star sparks SETI interest https://t.co/Q5Lk42lA18 pic.twitter.com/dox1218NIs \u2014 The SETI Institute (@SETIInstitute) August 29, 2016 Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, wrote in a blog post that the signal was \u201cinteresting,\u201d but said \u201c the chance that this is truly a signal from extraterrestrials is not terribly promising .\u201d Advertisement SETI astronomers have swung the Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California, in the direction of the supposed signal, yet so far have found nothing. Shostak said sending a signal from HD 164595 to Earth would require incredible amounts of power. If the signal was being sent from a planet in all directions at once, it would require \u201chundreds of times more energy than all the sunlight falling on Earth, and would obviously require power sources far beyond any we have.\u201d If the signal was being aimed at Earth, it would require power \u201ccomparable to the total energy consumption of all humankind.\u201d \u201cBoth scenarios require an effort far, far beyond what we ourselves could do, and it\u2019s hard to understand why anyone would want to target our solar system with a strong signal,\u201d Shostak wrote. \u201cThis star system is so far away they won\u2019t have yet picked up any TV or radar that would tell them that we\u2019re here.\u201d Advertisement Others agreed. Astrophysicist Katie Mack told The Register that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like a particularly compelling candidate for a SETI signal.\u201d It was an isolated event, and most of those unexpected signals have other explanations. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even look like terrestrial interference has been ruled out \u2015 sometimes something as simple as a spark from a power line can cause radio interference that can mess with telescopes,\u201d she was quoted as saying. \u201cWith only one blip like this, seen by one telescope, it\u2019s really impossible to know what it might have come from.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

John Glenn, Astronaut And American Hero, Hospitalized Details of the 95-year-old's condition and diagnosis were not disclosed. Kim Palmer Dec 7, 2016, 05:54 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Stringer . / Reuters John Glenn , the first American to orbit the Earth and a former U.S. senator and war hero, has been hospitalized for more than a week, an official said on Wednesday. Glenn , 95, is at the James Cancer Hospital at Ohio State University but does not necessarily have cancer, said Hank Wilson, spokesman at the university\u2019s John Glenn College of Public Affairs, which Glenn helped found. Advertisement \u201cWhen you\u2019re 95, it\u2019s always considered serious,\u201d said Wilson, who did not have further details about Glenn \u2019s condition or his prognosis. Glenn , the last surviving member of the original seven \u201cRight Stuff\u201d Mercury astronauts, had a knee replacement operation in 2011 and underwent heart surgery in 2014. Glenn was credited with reviving U.S. pride after the Soviet Union\u2019s early domination of manned space exploration, as he became the first American to orbit the Earth on Feb. 20, 1962. Reaching speeds of more than 17,000 miles per hour, he circled the globe three times in just under five hours in the Friendship 7 capsule. Glenn instantly became a hero, receiving a ticker-tape parade in New York City and the Space Congressional Medal of Honor from President John Kennedy. Advertisement His experiences as a pioneer astronaut were chronicled in the book and movie \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d along with the other Mercury pilots. Glenn also became the oldest astronaut ever, returning to space at the age of 77 on Oct. 29, 1998. Before he went into space, Glenn already had a reputation as one of the best test pilots in the country, setting a transcontinental speed record by flying from Los Angeles to New York in three hours and 23 minutes in July 1957. It was the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed. He also earned six Distinguished Flying Crosses and flew more than 150 missions as a fighter pilot in World War Two and the Korean War.

Scientists Can Detect Your Sleeptime Memories Even If You Can\u2019t Trying to learn Spanish while you nap, eh? By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Aug 29, 2016, 02:30 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A few words might be getting through in your sleep. Hank Morgan/Getty Images For the very ambitious who want to capitalize on the one-third of their lives spent asleep, learning while snoozing is the ultimate dream. Just imagine if you could learn a new language by streaming podcasts into your sleeping ears. And then another language, and then another. That unfortunately is still a dream. But in a new study, published Aug. 24 in the journal Neuroscience of Consciousness , researchers found that faint traces of memory formed during sleep even if the individuals themselves remained largely unaware of those memories. Advertisement In the study, neuroscientists Thomas Andrillon and Sid Kouider of Paris\u2019 Ecole Normale Superieure asked 22 participants to listen to an audio stream of words as they drifted into sleep. The words kept playing in their ears during the nap. Upon awakening, participants did not remember the words they had heard while asleep and couldn\u2019t tell them apart from new words in a memory test. However, using electroencephalography, which picks up on the brain\u2019s electrical activity, the researchers found an implicit memory trace for words presented during sleep: Hearing those words after the nap triggered a EEG result different from that of completely new words. Advertisement The scientists could correctly determine whether the participant\u2019s brain had heard a certain word during sleep 55 percent of the time \u2015 again even though the participant had no memory of it. Of course, 55 percent accuracy is hardly a reliable crystal ball for mind reading but it\u2019s still above the level of chance, Andrillon said. Moreover, EEG data are only an approximation of brain activity. It\u2019s akin to trying to listen in on people\u2019s conversations from outside a bar. You can\u2019t hear much but can pick up on the occasional collective cheer. Advertisement The finding that words heard in sleep leave a trace behind was corroborated by measuring participants\u2019 confidence level in memory tests. When participants were asked if a certain word was presented to them during sleep, they expressed a bit more confidence in their answer when it was correctly yes \u2014 as if they had a hunch about that word. Scientists know that during sleep, the brain reviews and stores information learned throughout the day. This nighttime housekeeping, it\u2019s been thought, keeps the brain too busy to form any new memories of what happens during sleep itself. But the new findings suggest that some minimal memory formation is possible. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean you can learn new information during sleep in any useful way. If anything, the memory traces were so weak that one could conclude the opposite: that it\u2019s really hard, if not impossible, to learn anything useful during sleep. Advertisement In other words, Andrillon said, the potential benefits of nighttime learning are not worth losing quality sleep over.

Crittercam Video Shows Strange Way Jumbo Squid 'Flash' To Communicate WATCH: Strange Way Jumbo Squid 'Talk' To Each Other By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 24, 2015, 10:53 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Marine biologists have long known that giant Humboldt squid communicate by rapidly changing their body color in flashes of red and white. But what message do the flashes send? A new video brings scientists one step closer to answering that question. Researchers at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, Calif., mounted \"Crittercams\" to the backs of the big carnivorous squid , National Geographic reported. And when they checked the video (above), the scientists saw quite a show. Advertisement The video showed the five- to six-foot-long cephalopods changing colors. It also showed them making arm-to-arm contact, which the scientists believe might have been mating attempts. How are the squid able to change color? A Humboldt squid appears to flash shades of red or white when the pigmented cells that cover its body, called chromatophores, expand or contract . \"The frequency and phase relationships [synchronization] between squid during flashing can be changed and this suggests that there is some information being conveyed that makes minute control over these details important to the squid ,\" Hannah Rosen, a doctoral student at the university and the leader of the research, said in a written statement. \"A view into this previously secret world was like a dream come true.\" Advertisement Rosen and her colleagues say they hope to conduct further research to find out just what these squid are \"saying.\" A paper describing the research was published Jan. 15, 2015 in The Journal of Experimental BIology.

Deflated Footballs: Mother Nature Didn't Do It Unless you are Rip van Winkle, you are well aware that the footballs in the game in New England were underinflated. There is talk that the weather is to blame. If you run the numbers, here's what the equation looks like. By Ainissa G.

If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Unless you are Rip van Winkle, you are well aware that the footballs in the game in New England were underinflated . There is talk that the weather is to blame. If you run the numbers, the equation looks like this: To do the calculation, let's assume that the pressure before the game is 13 psi (P), that the temperature of the locker room is 70 degrees Fahrenheit (T), and that the game was played on an unseasonably warm January day at 49 degrees Fahrenheit (T). Then, the trick is to solve for the pressure of the ball when on the field (P). So does this drop in temperature account for the missing two pounds of pressure? After some mathematical wrangling , the answer is no. This temperature difference between the locker room and the temperature of the field does not account for the change. You get a value of 12.5 psi, which is within the limits for the football pressure of 12.5 and 13.5 psi as set by NFL Rule 2 Section 1 . (Note about the math: You can't just plug in these numbers directly, they need to be converted to Newton/meter and Kelvin and then converted back to units we use.) Advertisement Here is a simple video that does the math. And, if we did these mathematical gymnastics again and this time used the lower limit of 12.5 psi as the starting point, then the ball pressure this time will be 12 psi. The bottom line is that you cannot blame Mother Nature for the missing pounds of pressure, not fully. Advertisement As with science, there are of course other factors involved and more exacting ways to do this calculation. But, whether you run these numbers on back of an envelope or at a computer at NASA, the bottom line is the same: Mother Nature is off the hook!

LEAVE A COMMENT Mars' own Grand Canyon, Valles Marineris, is shown on the surface of the planet in this composite image made aboard NASA's Mars Odyssey spacecraft. NASA/Arizona State University via Getty Images In 1964, Mariner 4 became the first spacecraft to successfully arrive at Mars. While some scientists of the time were expecting a world much like our own, one filled with rivers, oceans, and maybe even life, Mariner\u2019s images instead unveiled a heavily-cratered surface, not unlike the Moon\u2019s. That\u2019s why it was such a surprise when later NASA missions, such as Viking, benefiting from improved technology, revealed a martian landscape more like our Earth\u2019s. These newer images showed large fluvial features in ancient terrains, including the ancient river valley networks, inferred to have formed nearly 4 billion years ago. Therefore, many have argued that Mars may have once possessed a warmer climate, perhaps with a thicker atmosphere that could have supported potentially habitable conditions. Such a warmer early Mars may have been more \u201cEarth-like\u201d in many ways. So, it may be natural to wonder: How Earth-like does a planet need to be to host life? Did Mars ever have life? Does Mars have life now? Scientists operating on Mars could address these and similar questions that ultimately stem from one overriding question: Are we alone in the universe? Advertisement A comparison (to scale) of portions of the Grand Canyon (a) and Nanedi Valles (b), one of the ancient martian valley networks. Chester Harman (Adapted from work by Ramses Ramirez) The size and scope of the ancient martian valley networks are impressive. Often hundreds of meters deep, and extending for hundreds of kilometers, these immense fluvial features likely required a climate that was warm enough, at least transiently, to have produced enough rain (or snow) to carve them. These valleys would have been difficult to form in a cold climate because much of the water would have been present as ice instead. To be fair, salty water \u2015 known as brines \u2015 perhaps flowing from underground sources, could remain in liquid form at below freezing temperatures. However, it is difficult to envision how a sufficient volume of briny flows to form these massive features could be produced in a cold climate with little precipitation. If the atmosphere was also significantly thinner than the Earth\u2019s, even if surface life had arisen in such a cold climate, that life would have had to contend with less protection from harmful radiation. Advertisement Likewise, life has yet to be found on today\u2019s martian surface. The average surface temperatures are well below the freezing point of water. Furthermore, the combination of a tenuous atmosphere and lack of a magnetic field allow harmful solar and cosmic rays to pass through and impact the surface. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that microbial life may currently be living in the planet\u2019s subsurface, shielded from the worst of the radiation. And even if no life exists today, extinct organisms from earlier times may be preserved underground as fossils, waiting to be unearthed by explorers from Earth. \u201cHumans on Mars is not a capricious whim, but rather is an imperative to scientific progress.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Moreover, Mars lends itself better to manned scientific exploration than does our other neighbors. For example, modern spacecraft cannot withstand the crushing atmospheric pressures and infernal surface temperatures of Venus. The surface of Venus also appears to have undergone periodic gigantic volcanic eruptions that have engulfed the entire planet in lava numerous times, destroying any potential evidence of fluvial features from an earlier period. Mercury is too hot and close to the Sun. The atmospheres of both the Moon and Mercury are too thin to have ever sustained substantial amounts of liquid water on their surfaces for a significant amount of time, even if both worlds may have some water ice residing in permanently shadowed regions. Thus, Mars presents a unique opportunity as the only neighboring world that exhibits clear observational evidence of a climate that was once warm and wet enough to create extensive fluvial features across its surface, often similar to ones seen on our Earth. Advertisement If we imagine that explorers from Earth find fossils proving that life had existed on Mars during this hypothetical early warm period (assuming that scientists rule out possible microbial contamination from the Earth), it may suggest that life has a high probability of emerging under atmospheric conditions not unlike those on our planet. However, even on Earth, we know that certain organisms thrive in extreme conditions very unlike those you or I experience daily on the surface. These extremophiles can withstand extreme heat, cold, acidity, pressures, and even salt content, all at levels that would be deadly to most other Earth life. What if similar hardy micro-organisms are thriving today on Mars\u2019 cold, dry, and irradiated surface? We can only definitively answer such questions by sending scientists to Mars who are dedicated to finding evidence of past or present life. The results of such an endeavor would clarify our perspective as to what is possible even as we speculate about life on the more distant targets of Europa, Enceladus, Titan, and (ultimately) exoplanets. Humans on Mars is not a capricious whim, but rather is an imperative to scientific progress. Orbiters, rovers, and landers have all made great strides in increasing our understanding of the Red Planet but they cannot replace the judgment, ability to respond to unexpected situations, and sheer ingenuity of human scientists. As much as we have learned about Mars from afar, we would learn so much more by sending people there.

Sneaky Ways Retailers Use Science To Trick You Into Buying More Stuff How Retailers Use Psychology To Dupe You Into Buying More Stuff By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 26, 2015, 04:04 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT We'd like to think that we're in control of our consumption habits. But anyone who's ever walked out of Whole Foods with two heavy bags in their hands when they had intended to buy only a cucumber knows that this isn't always the case. Retailers know that we're vulnerable to a number of influences when considering our purchases -- and they've made a whole science out of optimizing the shopping experience. Many retailers manipulate nearly every aspect of our time in their inviting spaces -- from the layout and smell of the store to the price of the items to the behavior of the salespeople -- in order to separate you from as much of your money as possible. Advertisement Here are seven ways that consumers are using psychology to dupe you into buying more stuff. They appeal to our emotions using round numbers. When judging costs, there's more that goes into our decision to buy than just how high or low the cost is. The way the numbers are presented also makes a difference. A study recently published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that when a purchase is motivated by feelings, consumers prefer rounded numbers (e.g. $80). In contrast, a non-rounded price ($77.59) encourages consumers to buy when that purchase is based on reason. In other words, if the consumer is considering buying something they want, then they will be more likely to do so if the price is a round number. But if they are buying something they need, non-rounded numbers will be more persuasive. \"Ours is the first research to show that the mere roundedness of a price number could significantly influence consumer preferences, depending on whether a purchase is driven by feelings or has a more utilitarian purpose,\" the study's authors explain . Advertisement They fill the air with inviting scents. Next time you're at the mall, beware of the warm, comforting scents like cinnamon -- innocent as they may seem, they may be a retailer's way of tricking you into splurging on a new product. New research finds that people who smell \"warm\" fragrances feel that they're in a more crowded space, and as a result feel less powerful. \"This can lead them to compensate by buying items they feel are more prestigious,\" the study's authors explain . In the future, you might also find more and more stores (and not just L'Occitane) pleasing your nose with the calming scent of lavender as you walk in the door. According to a new study from Leiden University, the scent of lavender can create feelings of trust. Advertisement \"Smelling the aroma of lavender may help a seller to establish more easily a trusting negotiation to sell a car, or in a grocery store it may induce consumers to spend more money buying products,\" explained Leiden psychologist Roberta Sellaro . They're mean to you. Being harassed by rude salespeople might not seem like something that would make you want to become a patron of a particular store -- but the research suggests that in luxury stores, it may be the case. According to research from the University of British Columbia, consumers who interacted with rude staff at a high-end store were more likely to purchase expensive products. However, this effect did not extend to mass-market brands. Advertisement \"It appears that snobbiness might actually be a qualification worth considering for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci,\" marketing researcher Darren Dahl said in a statement . \"Our research indicates they can end up having a similar effect to an 'in-group' in high school that others aspire to join.\" They make it difficult to find what you need. Ever get lost in Ikea or a huge Forever 21 store? There's a good chance that you have, and that it was the store's fault -- not yours. Store layouts that feel like a maze might be frustrating, but they may also lead you to buy more. Basically, the store or mall employs a tactic meant to disorient you into buying more stuff. It's a phenomenon known in marketing and advertising as the \"Gruen Transfer\": There's a moment at which we stop looking for the item we were shopping for, and we start just shopping . Advertisement This is in many cases the reason that grocery stores relegate essential items like milk and eggs at the back of the store , forcing the consumer to wander through aisles to get there. They tempt you with delicious treats. \"Free\" samples might not be quite as altruistic as they seem. A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research indulging in a sweet treat can boost a shopper's desire for non-food luxuries. Just a taste of free chocolate could \"activate goals associated with indulgence... and encourage subsequent acts of indulgence,\" the researchers explain . Advertisement They let you play with things. If you're trying to save money, think twice before you try that hand lotion or pick through a pile of sweaters. According to 2009 research, consumers who touch products will pay more for them than those who keep their hands off. Apparently, putting our hands on things makes us feel a greater sense of ownership over them. \"When you touch something, you instantly feel more of a connection to it,\" study co-author Suzanne Shu, a marketing professor at UCLA told TIME . \"That connection stirs up an emotional reaction \u2014 'Yeah, I like the feel of it. This can be mine.' And that emotion can cause you to buy something you never would have bought if you hadn't touched it.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

They use music to get you in the mood to spend. While careful consumers buy less than usual when music is playing in a store, research has shown that impulse shoppers tend to be swayed by a good beat. A 2005 study found that shoppers who made unplanned purchases spent an average of $32 more when slow-tempo popular music was playing than those in a control condition with no music.

Now We Know How 'Lucy' Died 3 Million Years Ago. Maybe. Scientists say the iconic human ancestor fell out of a tree. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Aug 29, 2016, 04:10 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Cracking what must be one of the coldest cases of all time, scientists at the University of Texas claim to have figured out what killed \u201cLucy,\u201d the iconic human ancestral specimen who lived and died more than 3 million years ago. In a paper published Monday in the journal Nature, the researchers argue that the pattern of fractures seen in Lucy\u2019s 3.2-million-year-old fossilized bones show that she died as the result of a \u201cvertical deceleration event.\u201d Advertisement In other words, a severe fall from a considerable height. Scientists have long debated whether Lucy, a small bipedal creature who belonged to an extinct species known as Australopithecus afarensis , spent time in trees (arborealism) as well as on the ground \u2015 a point referenced by the paper\u2019s lead author in a written statement. \u201cIt is ironic that the fossil at the center of a debate about the role of arborealism in human evolution likely died from injuries suffered from a fall out of a tree,\u201d Dr. John Kappelman, a professor of anthropology and geological sciences at the university, said in the statement. A hypothetical scenario for Lucy's fall from a tree and the subsequent vertical deceleration. Researchers hypothesize that she landed feet first with the body pitching forward toward the right side. Valerie A Lopez and John Kappelman Advertisement For their research, Kappelman and and Dr. Richard Ketcham, a geological sciences professor at the university, used a CT scanner to create an archive of more than 35,000 \u201cslices\u201d of Lucy\u2019s fossilized skeleton (which was found in Ethiopia in 1974 and whose name was inspired by the Beatles song \u201cLucy In the Sky with Diamonds,\u201d according to the website of Arizona State University Institute of Human Origins). Subsequent analysis of the slices revealed sharp, clean breaks seen at the end of Lucy\u2019s right humerus (the long bone that runs from the shoulder to the elbow) that the researchers maintain are similar to bone fractures seen in victims of falls. The researchers concluded that these and other fractures in her skeleton show that Lucy, who is believed to have stood about 3 feet 6 inches and weighed about 60 pounds, fell feet first and used her arms to brace herself \u2015 but that the impact was too severe to have been survivable. Advertisement The researchers estimate that Lucy was going about 35 miles an hour when she hit the ground after falling from a height of roughly 40 feet, according to the statement. Professors John Kappelman and Richard Ketcham examine casts of Lucy while scanning the original fossil (background). Marsha Miller UT Austin That sounds plausible, if a bit gruesome. But other scientists are skeptical. Dr. Rebecca Ackermann, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town in Africa, told The Washington Post that the study had failed to disprove alternative explanations for the breaks \u2015 though she didn\u2019t dismiss the research out of hand. Advertisement \u201cIn my opinion this is a nice study that tells us something interesting about an individual who has played an important role \u2014 both scientifically and historically \u2014 in our understanding of human evolution,\u201d she told the Post. But others were harsher in their appraisal of the new research. \u201cThere is a myriad of explanations for bone breakage,\u201d Dr. Donald C. Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins and one of the scientists who discovered Lucy, told The Guardian. \u201cThe suggestion that she fell out of a tree is largely a \u201cjust-so story\u201d that is neither verifiable nor falsifiable , and therefore unprovable.\u201d Johanson said it was more likely that Lucy\u2019s fractures occurred long after she died , telling The New York Times that \u201celephant bones and hippo ribs appear to have the same kind of breakage. It\u2019s unlikely they fell out of a tree.\u201d Advertisement But the new research focused on \u201ca small subset of fractures\u201d that are consistent with \u201chigh-energy bone-to-bone impacts\u201d and which differ from the sorts of breaks commonly seen in fossilized bones, Kappelman told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cThese appear to have occurred perimortem (at or near the time of death).\u201d In any case, the fresh look at Lucy\u2019s old bones seem to have humanized her \u2015 at least for Kappelman.

The Scary Way Excessive Salt Intake May 'Reprogram' The Brain The Scary Way Excessive Salt Intake May 'Reprogram' The Brain By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 24, 2015, 10:10 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT There are many health reasons to lay off the salt, from fluid retention to an increased risk over time of developing high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke. While the link between sodium and hypertension is nothing new (thought some scientists say it is overstated ), the precise mechanisms by which sodium can raise blood pressure have been less clear. Advertisement According to new research from McGill University , too much sodium may actually \"reprogram\" the brain in a way that interferes with a process that normally keeps the body's arterial blood pressure at a healthy level. \"We found that a period of high dietary salt intake in rats causes a biochemical change in the neurons that release vasopressin (VP) into the systemic circulation,\" one of the study's authors, Dr. Charles Bourque of the McGill University Health Centre, said in a university press release . \"This change, which involves a neurotrophic molecule called BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), prevents the inhibition of these particular neurons by other cells.\" The researchers found that high salt intake prevents the inhibition of VP neurons, which normally occurs through a bodily system that detects pressure in the arteries. When this safety mechanism has been disabled, blood pressure is more likely to rise when sodium is increased in high levels over time. Advertisement However, other data suggests that we shouldn't be too worried about sodium. A large-scale study published this week in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that higher sodium intake was not correlated with a higher risk of mortality. The findings were published in the journal Neuron .

The Latest Hypocrisy in SVP Expert Testimony Railroading people inappropriately into psychiatric hospitals is a slippery slope that can lead to grave violation of human rights and a distortion of our most precious constitutional protections. By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Jan 26, 2015, 05:37 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. The United States Constitution does not allow 'preventive detention' -- a much abused 18th century prerogative of royal power that was abhorrent to our founding fathers. We are meant to be a country of law, not arbitrary state power. No imprisonment on suspicion that someone might commit a crime and no keeping someone in prison beyond his allotted sentence just because someone thinks he might still be dangerous Sexually Violent Predator laws in 20 states are an exception. Indefinite preventive detention in a psychiatric facility (really a prison in all but name) is permitted if the individual has committed a violent sexual crime and has a mental disorder that predisposes to its repetition. The US Supreme Court in a narrow 5-4 decision found this to be constitutional, but explicitly only if the perpetrator has a definite mental disorder that would distinguish him from the much more common opportunistic criminal rapist. No mental disorder, no preventive detention. In an attempt to facilitate preventive detention under SVP commitment statutes, many state evaluators blatantly misused the inherently unreliable Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified as a qualifying diagnosis in cases that involved no more than typical, opportunistic rape. Until recently, juries bought it -- unjustly committing common criminals to inappropriate psychiatric incarcerations. Advertisement This is now changing, especially since DSM-5 confirmed once again that rape is not a mental disorder (this is the fourth time DSM has rejected rape in 40 years). Paraphilia NOS is now widely recognized for the fake diagnosis it always was. This should be the end of a sad epoch of incompetent expert testimony in SVP cases -- but it isn't. Undeterred by any respect for proper diagnostic practice, many state evaluators have come up with a new fake diagnosis, intended to convert ineligible common criminality into SVP-ready mental disorder. The same patients who before were routinely mislabeled Paraphilia NOS are now being mislabeled as Sexual Sadists. Unlike rape, Sexual Sadism is an official DSM-5 diagnosis and, if properly diagnosed, is a legitimate qualifying mental disorder in SVP cases. Unfortunately, incompetent evaluators are now confusing the very specialized violence of sadism from the nonspecific violence of rape. The diagnosis of Sexual Sadism applies only to a tiny minority of rapists. Advertisement Rapists and sadists both are violent toward their victims -- but with quite different motivations. The goal of the rapist's violence is to rapidly and thoroughly control the victim to ensure her compliance with the sexual acts. For the vast majority of rapists, violence and control are no more than tools to force a non-consenting person to have sex. By definition, rape is nonconsensual sex that would only occur under conditions of overt or threatened violence. In contrast, the sadist has a much more specific motivation. His stereotyped (and often diabolical) violence and demeaning control are the main event of the sex act- fulfilling deeply held and \"recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies and sexual urges.\" For the sadist, sex would not be nearly so exciting (and might not even be possible at all) if it is not accompanied by violence that elicits the victim's pain, humiliation, and suffering. Rapists and sadists are both routinely cruel, unempathic, and show lack of concern regarding the impact of their attack on the victim -- but again for different reasons. For the sadist, the sexual excitement is enhanced by, or may exclusively reside in, being cruel in a way that elicits pain. For the rapist the pain inflicted is incidental, perhaps indifferent collateral damage, not the goal of the sex act. The rapist and the sadist both lack a conscience to inhibit hurting others, but only the sadist requires their pain as a sexual stimulant. Advertisement Rape is a always heinous, ugly, violent, and cruel. But the violence and cruelty that are part of all rapes should not be confused with the motivated violence and cruelty of Sexual Sadism that requires victim pain to generate excitement. Rape is a crime, not a mental disorder. Sexual Sadism is both. If this distinction is not thought through, made carefully, and supported with strong confirmatory evidence, virtually all rapists could conceivably receive a mistaken mental disorder diagnosis of Sexual Sadism and would then be subject to SVP commitment on that fallacious basis. This makes no sense and flies in the face of the Supreme Court rulings, which accepted the constitutionality of SVP statutes only if the rape is the result of a predisposing mental disorder that can be reliably distinguished from common criminality. Most coercive sex is explained not by Sexual Sadism and should not be mislabeled as such. The differences between rape and sadism are clear. In rape, the purpose of violence is instrumental -- to facilitate the victim's compliance with the sex act. In Sexual Sadism, the violence, cruelty, and gratification in the victim's suffering are all primary -- necessary preconditions for sexual arousal and for the fulfillment of the urgent, intense, and recurrent sadistic fantasies of inflicting harm and humiliation. Advertisement Of course there will be the occasional rapist who also fills criteria for Sexual Sadism and is suitable for SVP commitment, but this will be a rare finding among rapists and should require extensive supporting evidence. Sexual Sadism should not be used loosely to shoehorn common criminal rapists into a mental disorder category in order to justify a psychiatric preventative detention that would otherwise be unconstitutional. I have no sympathy for rapists and think they deserve long prison sentences meted out by the criminal justice system. But I have even less sympathy for the misuse of psychiatric testimony in the courtroom, for evaluators who play loose with proper diagnostic practice, and with the misuse of psychiatric incarceration. Railroading people inappropriately into psychiatric hospitals is a slippery slope that can lead to grave violation of human rights and a distortion of our most precious constitutional protections.

Although NASA doesn\u2019t have independent confirmation of the event, Paul Chodas, manager of their Near-Earth Object office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the dazzling streak could be explained by a \u201creally tiny asteroid hitting the atmosphere.\u201d Advertisement \u201cIt looks to me to be real,\u201d he told The Huffington Post. \u201cThis would be a fireball \u2015 that\u2019s a large, bright meteor.\u201d Witness Olga Sagalakova described her terrifying experience to RT, an English-language news outlet funded by the Russian government. \u201cAt first, I couldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. There was a sudden luminescence. It wasn\u2019t as light as day, but still quite bright,\u201d she said. \u201cFrankly, I was scared. I thought that it was a bomb.\u201d Advertisement Several witnesses apparently caught the celestial flyby on video: Residents in the Russian city of Sayanogorsk witnessed a dazzling sight when a meteor streaked through the night sky https://t.co/ZxPP6kdyyV pic.twitter.com/98zHSqTnjT \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) December 7, 2016 Judging from the brightness of the fireball, Chodas estimates it may have been 10 to 15 meters in size. Advertisement \u201cThere were no reports of a shockwave,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tells me it was not a large meteor like Chelyabinsk.\u201d The 2013 Chelyabinsk fireball was about 17 meters in diameter, and its explosion was about 30 times as powerful as the atomic bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Is What The Universe Looks Like 11.1 Billion Light-Years From Earth Scientists have made a record-breaking discovery. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Aug 31, 2016, 01:04 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This is what 11.1 billion light-years from Earth looks like. NASA Far out doesn\u2019t even begin to describe this discovery. Scientists using NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes have found the most distant galaxy cluster ever seen , the space agency said on Tuesday. The not-so-elegantly named CL J1001+0220 is 11.1 billion light-years from Earth and contains 11 massive galaxies in its core. Advertisement \u201cThis galaxy cluster isn\u2019t just remarkable for its distance, it\u2019s also going through an amazing growth spurt unlike any we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Tao Wang of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission. To be specific, nine of those 11 galaxies are forming stars \u201cat a rate that is equivalent to over 3,000 Suns forming per year,\u201d NASA says. Scientists described the discovery in a study published Tuesday in the Astrophysical Journal .

Weather Channel Destroys Breitbart Over BS Climate Change Story \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: Science doesn\u2019t care about your opinion.\" By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 6, 2016, 07:32 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The Weather Channel/YouTube A week after Breitbart News published a wildly inaccurate article chalking climate change up as a hoax, The Weather Channel decided to teach the hyper-conservative news outlet a thing or two about scientific fact. In a post to its website, TWC called the Breitbart piece , which relied heavily on a story published in the Daily Mail, \u201ca prime example of cherry picking, or pulling a single item out of context to build a misleading case.\u201d Advertisement Note to @BreitbartNews : Earth Is Not Cooling, Climate Change Is Real and Stop Using Our Video to Mislead Americans https://t.co/ipP0fD2BEg pic.twitter.com/ypSMJ4eML6 \u2014 The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) December 6, 2016 TWC\u2019s scathing response features a video post in which atmospheric scientist Kait Parker breaks down each of Breitbart\u2019s claims, including that \u201c global land temperatures have plummeted .\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: Science doesn\u2019t care about your opinion,\u201d Parker says in the video. \u201cCherry picking and changing the facts will not change the future, not the fact \u2015 note: fact, not opinion \u2015 that the earth is warming.\u201d Advertisement Here\u2019s Parker\u2019s full takedown: \u201cWhat\u2019s worse\u201d than the Breitbart story itself, Parker said, is the fact that the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology posted the story to Twitter. That\u2019s ridiculous but shouldn\u2019t be surprising. The committee is chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), who has a long history of denying climate change , attacking those who accept the scientific consensus and defending the fossil fuel industry . (Also unsurprisingly, the congressman has received more than $693,000 from the oil and gas industry over the course of his career.) Advertisement Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was among those who mocked the House science committee for circulating the story. Where'd you get your PhD? Trump University? https://t.co/P5Ez5fVEwD \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 1, 2016 Along with its video, TWC\u2019s published a lengthy retort to each of the article\u2019s three main claims , as well as a final message for its \u201cfriends\u201d at Breitbart. Advertisement \u201cThe next time you write a climate change article and need fact checking help, please call. We\u2019re here for you,\u201d it wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure we both agree this topic is too important to get wrong.\u201d If their response on Twitter is any indication, the folks over at Breitbart aren\u2019t planning to run a correction. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Some Planets That <em>Seem</em> Life-Friendly Might Not Be. Here's What That Means For The Search For E.T. 'Chaotic' Planets Make The Search For E.T. More Complicated By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 16, 2015, 08:51 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT When looking for alien life, astronomers pay special attention to planets in the so-called \" Goldilocks zone \" -- that is, planets that orbit their host stars at just the right distance for water to exist in a liquid state. But a new study shows that some otherwise habitable planets might be rendered unsuitable for life because gravitational forces exerted by neighboring planets have nudged these \"chaotic Earths\" out of stable orbits and given them unstable climates. Advertisement \"Just like people, some planets are victims of circumstance, and won't enjoy a placid existence,\" Dr. Seth Shostak , senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who was not involved in the new research, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"That might be bad news for them -- at least in terms of harboring life over very long time periods.\" Planets go haywire. For the study, astronomers at the University of Washington built computer models of solar systems in which planets orbit their host stars in different planes. (The orbits of planets in our own solar system all lie in the same plane.) The planets in the models had orbital periods that were integer multiples of one another, or in integer ratios. For example, if a planet orbits its host star in 200 days and another planet orbits the same star in 300 days, their orbital periods are related in a 2:3 ratio. This coordination causes the planets to pull on each other's orbits in the same spot over and over again, which over millions of years can cause major changes in these orbits. Advertisement \u201cWhat we found was that things go all haywire,\" Dr. Rory Barnes, one of the astronomers and the study's lead author, said in a written statement. \"Those little perturbations that keep happening at the same point cause one of the orbits to do some crazy things -- even flip over entirely -- and then kind of come back to where it was before. It was pretty unexpected for us.\u201d Wacky climate changes. According to Barnes, one effect of the perturbations would be to give the planets wildly shifting climates. \"You would never know when the next ice age or hot spell was coming ,\" Barnes told Space.com. \"In many cases, the changes can take thousands of years to occur, so they wouldn't be changes over your lifetime, but they would certainly impact the rise and fall of civilizations as rapid and constant climate change transformed deserts into ice fields and tropical rain forests into oceans.\" Advertisement Though unstable climates might make some planets uninhabitable, Shostak argues that such climates might actually lead to the formation of life on others. \"When our planet was frozen over during an episode known as 'snowball Earth,' the effect on the biota seems to have been to stimulate the emergence of complex, multicellular organisms,\" he said in the email. \"In that sense, a planet's hard times might be just what's required to produce interesting life forms.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Exposure To Nature May Reduce Crime, Strengthen Communities Communities where people see and spend more time in nature have higher levels of cohesion. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Dec 1, 2015, 02:53 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Cameron Davidson via Getty Images As urbanization, population growth and the rampant destruction of the natural world increase, human beings have become more and more isolated from nature -- and at a significant cost. Spending time in nature is good for both the body and the mind, leading to health benefits including reduced depressive symptoms and lower blood pressure . As it turns out, the benefits of exposure to nature don't stop with individuals -- they also extend to entire communities and societies. Advertisement A study recently published in the journal BioScience finds that contact with nature is associated with stronger communities and lower crime rates. For the study, the researchers measured the relationships between individual and community assessments of exposure to nature, community cohesion and crime rates. They asked a group of 2,000 participants from various communities to report on their access to nature, the amount of time spent in nature, and how much nature they can see from their homes. These responses were then pooled to come up with a measure of the community's exposure to nature. The results were striking: Contact with nature appeared to have a significant effect on promoting community ties and reducing violence. Advertisement Controlling for other factors such as socioeconomic deprivation, population density and unemployment, exposure to nature accounted for a full 8 percent of variance in community cohesion -- meaning that people felt closer to their communities. To put that in perspective, individual factors such as age, income and gender together accounted for only 3 percent of the variation. Exposure to nature was also linked with reduced crime. The analysis revealed that the amount of accessible green spaces or farmlands in a community accounted for 4 percent of variability in crime rates, making exposure to nature nearly as large of a factor in crime as socioeconomic deprivation, which accounts for 5 percent of crime rate variability. What explains these dramatic effects? \"It might be that green space encourages people to band together and support their communities in ways that discourages local crime,\" Dr. Netta Weinstein, a psychologist at Cardiff University and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post in an email. Advertisement Alternatively, it could have something to do with the psychological benefits of exposure to nature, which include lower stress levels, reduced depression and anxiety, and even putting the brain into a state of meditation . If individuals enjoy improved physical and psychological health as a result of spending time in nature, they may be more likely to feel connected to their community and less likely to engage in crime. With increasing urbanization and environmental destruction related to climate change, more people are becoming alienated from the natural world. Although further research is needed to confirm the findings, they do suggest that improving access to nature -- for instance, through urban planning initiatives to create more green spaces in cities -- could reduce crime rates. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Black Hole Eats A Star The Size Of Our Sun... And Burps The belch set out a jet of matter moving at nearly the speed of light. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Dec 1, 2015, 12:17 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT This cosmic giant has no manners. Some 300 million light years away, a supermassive black hole has swallowed a star and burped up a jet of matter at nearly the speed of light, an international team of researchers has found. The star is about the size of our sun, but the black hole is 1 million times as massive. So it snared the stellar meal in its gravitational pull, according to Sjoert van Velzen, a Hubble fellow at Johns Hopkins University who led the research. Advertisement \"A star getting swallowed by a black hole is not new , although they are still rare,\" he told The Huffington Post. \"Only a few dozen of these unlucky stars have been observed so far. What is new about our study is that we first saw, in great detail, the star getting torn apart and then found the high-speed outflow -- aka the jet.\" From left, an artist's conception of a star being drawn toward a black hole and destroyed. The black hole later emits a jet of plasma composed of the debris left from the star's destruction. Johns Hopkins University/Modified from an original image by Amadeo Bachar The researchers have observed this star since scientists in Ohio discovered it in 2014. Velzen's team continued observations when they realized that the the radio light from the star was rapidly changing and that something intriguing was going on. Advertisement With the help of NASA's swift satellite , the scientists could say with confidence that the changes came from the newly launched jet of charged particles. In other words, the black hole burped up debris left from the star's destruction. \"From our observations, it looks like jets are a common response from black holes that are that subjected to more gas than they can swallow at once,\" Velzen said. However, the astrophysicists still aren't sure exactly how they work, from what they're entirely made of or how the jets are launched. Advertisement A Harvard team also observing the hungry black hole put their observations online last month. \"The Harvard team observed the same source, but with a different radio telescope --they used the Very Large Array, in New Mexico ,\" Velzen said. \"They were the first to put their results online, while we were the first to get our work published in a journal. So we both get our claim to fame.\" Both teams plan to continue observations. The research was published in the journal Science on Thursday.

Climate Summit Gets Heat For Huge Carbon Footprint, But It's Not All Bad Let's put the numbers in perspective. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Dec 3, 2015, 01:47 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A conference attendee studies a projection of the Earth on the first day of the COP21 United Nations conference on climate change. Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images Sure, it's easy to spot the irony of the United Nations Paris COP21 climate conference . While leaders from 195 countries attend the summit to curb emissions, increase investment in renewable energy and maintain a robust world economy, they are actively leaving their own carbon footprint. The transportation, food, drinks, and accommodation for the estimated 50,000 visitors that have flocked to the city of light -- including heads of state, scientists, journalists and activists -- will emit 300,000 tons (or around 600 million pounds) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, according to Wired magazine and Forbes. Advertisement But it's all for a good cause -- and those emissions don't even come close to what the London 2012 Summer Olympics , the 2014 Brazil World Cup and Thanksgiving Day in America each produced . The emissions number from the Paris climate talks comes from this calculation: 50,000 people traveling an average of 9,000 miles in a Boeing 747 to Paris will burn 27 million gallons of jet fuel and release about 575 million pounds of CO2, according to Wired. The media has been quick to pounce on these embarrassing numbers . Gizmodo reported that it\u2019s \"worth wondering why we couldn\u2019t possibly manage to do this thing virtually ... Have everyone Skype in their pledges and spend this week getting to work.\" Advertisement But there's a reason to stay positive. The world produces 80 quadrillion pounds of CO2 each year. So 575 million pounds is only equivalent to 22 seconds worth of annual emissions. President Barack Obama (L) and French President Francois Hollande (R) with Secretary of State John Kerry (2nd R), French Minister for Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Segolene Royal, (3rd R) and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (2nd L) in Paris Nov. 30. THIBAULT CAMUS via Getty Images The U.N. is working with the French government and attendees to reduce emissions and offset them in order to make the conference, hypothetically, carbon neutral. Advertisement While offsets have garnered criticism for being an ineffective fix to a problem that's already out of hand, Wired concedes that climate plans initiated by the conference will be \"probably enough to smudge out those 22 seconds of emissions.\" Climate control advocates including David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, have for the most part argued that the trip will be worth it . \"For the last 30 years we've been stuck in a vicious cycle,\" he told the New York Daily News. \"If they do their job, they will put in place the policies that reduce carbon emissions by billions of tons. That'll be worth the jet fuel.\" Advertisement Generating enough energy to run an average U.S. household produces around 50 tons of carbon dioxide each year, according to the CoolClimate Network. But it's easy to offset those emissions if you give money toward support projects that halt deforestation, install renewable energy sources in your home, or promote energy efficiency. You could install a smart thermostat, insulate your home to save energy, drive less, participate in meatless Monday , buy a hybrid car, install solar panels, or fly less. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Discover Feathered Dinosaur Tail Trapped in Amber The surprise finding is 99 million years old. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Dec 8, 2016, 10:08 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Tiny feathered tail of a 99-million-year-old dinosaur the size of a sparrow is shown captured in amber. Royal Saskatchewan Museum/RC McKellar In a groundbreaking find, scientists have discovered the preserved tail of a tiny, 99-million-year-old feathered dinosaur. The delicately feathered 1.4-inch tail with bone and tissue intact was frozen in time in a piece of amber originally discovered in a mine in northern Myanmar. It was eventually found last year at a street market by paleontologist Lida Xing of Beijing\u2019s University of Geosciences. Advertisement \u201cI never expected we could find a dinosaur in amber. This may be the coolest find in my life,\u201d Xing told NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime find,\u201d his research partner Ryan McKellar of Canada\u2019s Royal Saskatchewan Museum told CNN . \u201cThe finest details are visible and in three dimensions.\u201d Advertisement They\u2019re believed to be the first-ever non-avian dinosaur feathers found preserved in amber, which are providing a fascinating glimpse into the early evolution of feathers and flight. The feathers, brown on top with white undersides, cover eight vertebrae in the specimen dating to the mid-Cretaceous period. Because the bones are articulated, and not fused together as in modern birds, the creature was a dinosaur and not a prehistoric bird capable of flight, according to the scientists, who reported their findings in Current Biology. The weak structure of the crude, early feathers that lack the interlocking architecture of ones developed up the evolutionary ladder was also not conducive to flight, according to the researchers. The feathers are missing a strong central shaft, known known as a rachis. Advertisement Instead of providing the capability of flight, the feathers, which likely covered the entire dinosaur, may have provided temperature regulation or some kind of signal , McKellar speculated to the National Geographic. Scientists believe the tail belonged to a juvenile coelurosaur, part of the family of theropod dinosaurs related to Tyrannosaurus rex as well as others that developed into modern birds. Researchers have nicknamed the specimen Eva. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Intriguingly, tissue around the bones still held had traces of ferrous iron, the remains of hemoglobin from Eva\u2019s blood. Eva was likely the size of a sparrow at death, but would have grown to the size of an ostrich had she lived. Advertisement Eva adds a key new piece to the feather puzzle. \u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular little glimpse ,\u201d McKellar told NPR. \u201cIt gives us, basically, a pathway that gets us to modern feathers.\u201d Related science Dinosaurs New Horned Dinosaur Species Unearthed In Utah Carbon Emissions Haven't Been This High Since The Dinosaurs Fossilized Feathers Reveal Similarity Between Dinosaur And Ostriches Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Watch These Amazing Ants Use Their Jaws To Catapult Themselves Out Of Death Pits WATCH: Tiny Ants Have Amazing Way To Escape From Death Pits By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 15, 2015, 08:52 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT That's one small snap for an ant, one giant leap for antkind. The trap-jaw ant , Odontomachus brunneus, is well-known for its ultra-fast mandible, which can snap shut at speeds of up to 143 miles per hour. Using its jaw, it can stun and maim its prey in an instant -- but that's not all that jaw can do... The ants can also use their mandibles to catapult their bodies like tiny acrobats to escape from traps built in the sand by predatory antlions -- and according to a new study, this ability doubles their survival rate. Just check out the video above. Advertisement (Story continues below.) For the study, Larabee collected 228 antlions and an equal number of trap-jaw ants. One-third of the trap-jaws had their mandibles glued shut, while the other two-thirds didn't. Trap-jaw ant with its mandible glued shut. The antlions were placed in plastic cups filled with sand, where they dug conical pits and buried themselves at the bottoms. Then the researchers dropped the trap-jaw ants into the \"arenas\" and waited to see whether the insects would escape from their predators. \u201cThe [unglued] ants were able to jump out of the pits about 15 percent of the time in their encounters with antlions,\u201d Fredrick Larabee, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the study's lead author, said in a written statement. \u201cBut when we glued their mandibles shut before dropping them in the pits, they couldn\u2019t jump at all. It cut their survival rate in half.\u201d Advertisement According to the researchers, the ant's spring-loaded jaw serves as an example of evolutionary \"co-option,\" where a feature that was selected for one function gets co-opted for another. \"In this case, a tool that is very good for capturing fast or dangerous prey also is good for another function, which is escape,\" Larabee said in the statement. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Why The Discovery Of The Milky Way's 'Dark Twin' Is Such A Big Deal Dragonfly 44 could help solve one of nature's biggest mysteries. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Aug 28, 2016, 01:47 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The dark galaxy Dragonfly 44. In the image on the left, the galaxy is visible only as a faint smudge of light. In the long-exposure image on the right, the galaxy is visible as a large elongated object Pieter van Dokkum Roberto Abraham Gemini Sloan Digital Sky Survey Astronomers have discovered a vast galaxy made up almost entirely of dark matter , an unexpected find that could bring us one step closer to understanding what the mysterious stuff is all about. Dubbed Dragonfly 44, the collection of stars lies about 330 million light-years from Earth in a group of galaxies known as the Coma cluster . It\u2019s about the size of our own Milky Way galaxy but much, much fainter. It contains only about 1 billion stars, which is roughly 1 percent the number of stars in our galaxy. Advertisement And 99.99 percent of the mass in what some are calling \u201cthe Milky Way\u2019s dark twin \u201d is in the form of dark matter, an invisible substance that is believed to make up 85 percent of everything in the universe. Dark matter can be \u201cseen\u201d in the way if affects the movement of stars within galaxies but it has never been directly observed \u2015 at least, not with any certainty. The team of astronomers who discovered Dragonfly 44 with the help of Hawaii\u2019s W. M. Keck Observatory were completely surprised to find the dark galaxy. \u201cWe knew about other galaxies that are almost entirely dark matter, but those are tiny dwarf galaxies that are about a million times less massive than Dragonfly 44,\u201d Yale University astronomer Pieter van Dokkum, lead author of a paper about the discovery that was published last week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, told The Huffington Post. Advertisement \u201cIt is an exciting discovery,\u201d said Jeremiah Ostriker, an astrophysicist at Columbia University. \u201cIt gives us a chance to study [dark matter] in detail \u2015 close-up.\u201d How do we know Dragonfly 44 is made of dark matter if we can\u2019t see the stuff? The greater a galaxy\u2019s overall mass, the faster its stars move relative to each other. And the stars in Dragonfly 44 \u201cmove at velocities that are far greater than expected for such a dim galaxy,\u201d Roberto Abraham, a University of Toronto astronomer and a co-author of the paper, said in a news release. \u201cIt means that Dragonfly 44 has a huge amount of unseen mass.\u201d In other words, oodles of dark matter. Theory holds that dark matter particles annihilate each other and emit gamma radiation whenever they collide, van Dokkum said. Scientists have been searching for this distinctive signal in dwarf dark galaxies, he added, but the signal would be much stronger in a big dark matter galaxy like Dragonfly 44. Advertisement \u201cThe race is on to find massive dark galaxies are even closer to us than Dragonfly 44, so we can look for feeble signals that may reveal a dark matter particle,\u201d he said in the news release.

Scientists Warn Climate Change Will Trigger Rise In Terrifying Illness Think twice before ordering the snapper. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 2, 2015, 05:13 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT As if rising sea levels, extreme weather and a host of other drastic environmental impacts weren't enough, scientists are now predicting that global climate change will lead to an increase in ciguatera -- a nasty and incurable foodborne illness. Ciguatera is caused by eating tropical reef fish (such as grouper, snapper and barracuda) that have been contaminated with toxins from marine microalgae. It can result in nausea, vomiting and even some neurologic symptoms , including tingling fingers or toes and a reversed sense of hot and cold temperatures . In a new study published in the journal Ecological Modeling, researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that expected increases in ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean through 2099 will likely lead to far more abundant and more diverse neurotoxins associated with ciguatera fish poisoning. Advertisement A barracuda pictured near Key Largo, Florida. Shirley Vanderbilt/Getty Images The forecast is part of a larger effort to develop and implement strategies for managing the risk of the illness, NOAA said in a release. \u201cContaminated fish have no specific taste, color, or smell and there is no easy method for measuring ciguatoxins,\u201d said Steve Kibler, a NOAA scientist and the study\u2019s lead author, in the release. \u201cHowever, we can forecast risk based on where and when we are likely to find the algae that produce ciguatoxins.\u201d Advertisement More than 400 fish species are known to become contaminated, according to NOAA. In U.S. waters, ciguatera occurs in Hawaii, Guam, southern Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and occasionally in the Gulf of Mexico. Earlier this year, a study found that ciguatera poisonings in Florida were an estimated 28 times more common that previously thought . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

An estimated 10,000 to 50,000 people suffer from the illness each year, making it the most commonly reported marine toxin disease in the world . However, those are likely just the tip of the iceberg, as only an estimated 2 to 10 percent of all cases are actually reported to health authorities. Advertisement While ciguatera's symptoms can be treated, the illness itself has no cure. And anecdotal reports indicate that some patients experience recurring neurologic symptoms upon consuming alcohol, fish and other foods, even years after the initial exposure. \u201cWhatever I touched, if it was hot, it would feel cold. If it was cold, it felt hot,\u201d one patient recalled. \u201c I couldn\u2019t walk on the tile floor . It felt like it was burning me.\u201d If global sea level rise wasn't enough to convince you it's time to reduce your carbon footprint, maybe your appetite for fish will.

The World Needs Scientific Rationalism Science today has the power to inspire just as much as it always has, and today it is more important than ever that the scientific community capitalize on every opportunity it gets to re-engage, and to take on \"the war on science,\" if that is indeed what we have come to. By Professor Rolf-Dieter Heuer, Contributor CERN Director General CERN Director General May 9, 2015, 02:33 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

A scan of recent science-related headlines makes sorry reading for anyone with a rational, evidence-based world view. Drought in some places and flooding in others, set against a backdrop of climate skepticism. Increasing antibiotic resistance and the rise of superbugs, along with growing popular rejection of vaccines, set against clear evidence that vaccines work. Food shortages set against popular resistance to the innovation necessary in agriculture to feed a growing population. There is increasing apathy towards science, verging, in some places, on hostility. National Geographic magazine takes this emerging phenomenon so seriously that its March 2015 cover bore the headline: \"The War on Science.\" Something has gone wrong with the way that science engages with society, but it is not too late to reverse the trend. On April 5 this year, a beam of protons circulated in the LHC for the first time in two years. It was an important, if somewhat symbolic, milestone on the way to starting data collection for the second run of the world's highest energy particle accelerator. Technically, it was not the most challenging part of the restart, yet still the world's media and social media were excited and enthusiastic about the prospect for new discoveries. A few months before, the world watched in awe as the European Space Agency landed the Rosetta probe on a comet in a breath-taking display of technological and scientific prowess. Advertisement Science today has the power to inspire just as much as it always has, and today it is more important than ever that the scientific community capitalize on every opportunity it gets to re-engage, and to take on \"the war on science,\" if that is indeed what we have come to. The power to inspire is not the only tool in the scientists' toolkit. Repeated studies of who people trust continue to put doctors and scientists at the top of the list. This is something that we scientists do not make enough of. The problem is that we are usually called upon to pronounce unequivocally on issues where there are no clear answers. If I take a flu vaccine, will that guarantee me a flu-free winter? Probably, based on the statistical evidence we have, but nobody can answer that with a categorical yes or no. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Science is not about absolute certainty; it is about degrees of certainty. The better the evidence, the more certain you can be. To illustrate this, take a simple experiment -- rolling a dice to test the hypothesis that it is not biased to come up with a six every time. If I roll the dice once and it gives me a six, I'd be foolish to predict a six every time. If I roll the same dice a million times and it comes up sixes every time, I'd feel more confident saying the dice is loaded, but it's still not absolutely certain: I may just have had a rather improbable, though not impossible, run of luck. Science always works like that, so let's go back to that flu vaccine. On the basis of the evidence, you're much more likely to have a flu-free winter if you take the vaccine than if you don't. Science needs to seize opportunities like the Rosetta landing and the LHC restart to talk not only about science, but also about how science works, and how evidence based consensus invariably points the way to progress. Advertisement Why does this matter? Humankind has reached a point at which just about everything we do, whether as individuals or as a society, relies on science and technology. Every decision we make will be better made through a rational evidence-based approach. We have also arrived at a time where the rate of progress in science is faster than ever. New technologies have the power to transform the lives of everyone on this planet for the better. However, as with all new technologies, there can be negative as well as positive applications, leading to sometimes complex ethical issues to address. Society needs to approach these with the rational, evidence-based approach that is the hallmark of science. If we do not, we will not solve the problem of climate change, we will see the re-emergence of diseases that for my generation were a thing of the past, and we will fail to feed the seven-plus billion people living on this planet. The stakes are high, so let's celebrate Rosetta and the LHC, and let's move forward to a rational future where science and society are one. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 27, 2016, 07:01 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A HI-SEAS scientist atop a ridge above the habitat. Christiane Heinicke/HI-SEAS HONOLULU, Hawaii \u2015 Sending humans to Mars presents enormous challenges, from the technological to the psychological. Perhaps no one understands the mental test better than the team of international scientists who just spent a year living inside an isolated, Mars-like habitat atop Hawaii\u2019s Mauna Loa volcano. Advertisement Sheyna Gifford , chief medical and safety officer of the fourth Hawaii Space Exploration and Analog and Simulation , or HI-SEAS, told The Huffington Post that the biggest challenges came from a \u201csense of helplessness.\u201d When things went wrong on Earth, whether it was a terrorist attack , flooding in Louisiana or a family member\u2019s death, \u201ctrying to find a way to help from here is very difficult,\u201d Gifford said. On Sunday, the six-man crew will emerge from their dome free of spacesuits for the first time in 365 days, bringing to a close the longest space travel simulation ever conducted on U.S. soil . Advertisement In the days leading up to what Gifford called their \u201creturn to Earth,\u201d HuffPost spoke with the crew, who have given the last year of their lives to preparing humans for life on Mars. Communicating via email and voice recordings, which were delayed 20 minutes to simulate communication in deep space, the HI-SEAS crew shared everything from personal hardships and plans for the future to the realization that humans are capable of anything. Since entering the habitat on Aug. 28 of last year, HI-SEAS members have only been allowed to venture outside while dressed in full spacesuits. The crew of HI-SEAS IV, from left to right: Cyprien Verseux, crew biologist; Christiane Heinicke, chief scientific officer and crew physicist; Carmel Johnston, crew commander; Tristan Bassingthwaighte, crew architect; Sheyna Gifford, chief medical and safety officer, crew journalist; Andrzej Stewart, chief engineering officer. Sheyna Gifford/HI-SEAS Advertisement In the hustle and bustle of everyday life on Earth, a year can seem to fly by. But isolate yourself to a 1,000-square-foot dome on rocky terrain 8,200 feet above sea level \u2015 or perhaps in the future, in a small habitat on Mars \u2015 and one might expect time to drag on. Luckily, the NASA-funded mission kept the HI-SEAS crew busy with a rigorous daily schedule of scientific research, geological field work, equipment testing, cooking, exercise and much more. Crew Commander Carmel Johnston said so much happens on simulated Mars that at times \u201cyou are just trying to keep your head above water.\u201d Advertisement The idea that the team has been up there an entire year, Gifford added, is \u201calmost absurd.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a year, I think that\u2019s the strangest part. It feels like we\u2019ve been here a few months,\u201d she said, adding a person\u2019s sense of time progresses completely differently. That\u2019s not to say the last 12 months have been a breeze. Beyond obvious things, like missing fresh food and the wind on your face, time away from Earth presents enormous emotional challenges. And that\u2019s one of the main goals of the simulated journey: to better understand the risks associated with space travel, including conflict, stress and depression. For example, Gifford\u2019s grandmother died about a month ago. Although her death was expected, Gifford said not being there for her family was extremely difficult. Advertisement \u201cI said goodbye to my grandmother over a delayed video message,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cThat\u2019s not something any of us ever want to do. So simply not being on Earth, I think everyone would agree, is the most challenging part of space.\u201d Johnston said she struggled with the \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d treatment she received from people who she expected would stay in touch. \u201cWe changed everything about our lives and limited ourselves to only communicating by email,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone didn\u2019t want to hop on that wagon, we just didn\u2019t hear from them this year. It can be pretty disheartening to feel like you are missing out on everything happening at home.\u201d Advertisement Tristan Bassingthwaighte , the crew architect, told HuffPost he often felt \u201cbored to death.\u201d Other times he just wanted to be alone, to find a place to get away. \u201cA person can be totally cool one minute and severely annoying the next,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe little things people do that you\u2019d never notice in real life can make you think about tripping them on the stairs here.\u201d Ultimately, it\u2019s how they dealt with such situations and interacted with one another that\u2019s of interest to NASA, which hopes to send astronauts to Mars at some point in the 2030s. Using cameras, body movement trackers and electronic surveys, researchers gathered data on a wide range of cognitive, social and emotional factors that could affect team performance during an extended mission to Mars. Advertisement Christiane Heinicke/HI-SEAS Surprisingly, the crew said that at no point did they ever feel like giving up, leaving their false, faraway world to return to Earthling life. When they did get bored or had down time, they found ways to keep busy. An avid reader, Bassingthwaighte said books were his \u201clittle doors to worlds that aren\u2019t this one.\u201d He\u2019s also been working on Doctor of Architecture degree and learned to cook with the limited resources he has available. He lost 20 pounds while in the habitat. Advertisement Gifford, who also served as crew journalist, published numerous online articles , including several blogs for HuffPost. The big question moving forward is what researchers can learn from the mission. The crew itself has no doubts that their sacrifices will help humans reach Mars. \u201cWith all the good and the bad comes lessons that you can\u2019t learn unless you are in isolation,\u201d Johnston wrote. \u201cEvery success or failure is still data and an outcome that can be used to improve the lives of astronauts and Martians.\u201d Advertisement \u201cWe still need to make the ships and bases (Looking at you SpaceX , I\u2019m available) and understanding this will help us make them right,\u201d Bassingthwaighte wrote. \u201cAfter that, a little time and effort and we\u2019ll have people on Mars in no time.\u201d Counting down to their so-called \u201cre-entry,\u201d the crew had their sights set on everyday things we Earthlings take for granted \u2015 hugging loved ones, feasting on a burger, swimming in the ocean and running on grass. In addition to spending time with family and getting outside, Bassingthwaighte\u2019s said he\u2019s looking forward to living in a place with a window. Advertisement \u201cI mean holy crap! A whole window that belongs just to me?\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to do with that, we\u2019ve all been sharing a window the size of a medium pizza for the last year.\u201d In her time away, Gifford said she\u2019s come to realize that the journey to Mars will likely prove more challenging in ways we don\u2019t expect than in ways we do. The good news, she said, is \u201chuman beings are pretty much capable of anything.\u201d There\u2019s one other point that Bassingthwaighte said he wants to clear up once and for all: The HI-SEAS crew is not actually on Mars, and they are not being sent to Mars. Advertisement \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at how many people don\u2019t get that,\u201d he wrote.

How Mindfulness Is Revolutionizing Mental Health Care How Mindfulness Is Revolutionizing Mental Health Care By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 23, 2015, 01:38 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT More than 350 million people globally suffer from depression, and 1 in 13 people around the world have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Overall, the World Health Organization estimates that roughly 450 million people suffer from some form of mental or neurological disorder -- and that roughly one in four people will be affected at some point in their lives. These numbers are staggering. With the rise of mental illness and the increasingly pressing need for effective treatments, there's never been a more important moment for mindfulness -- the ability to cultivate a focused, non-judgmental awareness on the present moment. Research has shown mindfulness and meditation-based programs to hold promise for treating a number of psychiatric conditions, including depression , anxiety , post-traumatic stress disorder , bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder . Advertisement As research has mounted in recent years, mindfulness has migrated from spiritual retreat centers to medical facilities. Now, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -- the largest scientific organization in the world dedicated to research on the understanding and treatment of mental illness -- is getting serious about investigating mindfulness as a complementary treatment for a range of mental health conditions. On Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, University of Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson and NIMH director Tom Insel joined a conversation hosted by NPR science correspondent Joe Palca about how mindfulness affects the brain and might lead to improved clinical applications for the treatment of a range of mental health conditions. So what exactly is mindfulness, and how can it improve psychological well-being? \"Mindfulness is about being fully aware in the present moment,\" said Davidson. \"It's about bringing our attention back to the present moment and not getting carried away by our thoughts.\" Advertisement Attention is highly trainable through various mindfulness practices like meditation, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), according to Davidson. \"We can actually educate our attention,\" he said. Mindfulness helps to train individuals in bringing back the attention time and time again when it has wandered. And it is precisely through helping individuals to not get carried away by their thoughts that mindfulness has been shown to be so effective for conditions like anxiety and depression. In fact, a landmark recent study from researchers at Lund University showed a group mindfulness treatment to be as effective as traditional talk therapy for treating anxiety and depression. Evidence of the efficacy of these mindfulness-based treatments continues to grow. According to Insel, there are now nearly 500 scientific studies on mindfulness/meditation and the brain in the National Institute of Health's PubMed database. Advertisement Mindfulness makes a whole lot of sense as a therapeutic intervention for these conditions. \"When they're depressed, people are locked in the past. They're ruminating about something that happened that they can't let go of,\" said Insel. \"When they're anxious, they're ruminating about the future -- it's that anticipation of what they can't control.\" In contrast, when we are mindful, we are focused on the here and now. Mindfulness trains individuals to turn their attention to what is happening in the present moment. On a neurological level, we're beginning to have a better understanding of the brain changes that underlie the improvements in psychological well-being and reduction of mental health symptoms that have been documented with mindfulness trainings. Advertisement Importantly, research has shown mindfulness to increase activity in brain areas associated with attention and emotion regulation. Mindfulness also facilitates neuroplasticity -- the creation of new connections and neural pathways in the brain. \"What we call meta-cognitive learning -- learning to watch your own mind and to be introspective in that sense -- does have an impact on brain pathways long-term,\" said Insel. This knowledge about the neurology of mindfulness could one day lead to improved clinical treatments. Advertisement But it's important to note that the beneficial effects of mindfulness also extend to non-clinical populations. Anyone can stand to benefit from learning to cultivate a focused, non-judgmental awareness on the present moment -- particularly in our busy modern lifestyles that are often characterized by stress, sleep deprivation, multitasking and digital distractions. Mindfulness research pioneer and founder of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Jon Kabat-Zinn, who was in the audience at Davos, stood up at the end of the conversation to share his thoughts on the mindful revolution in mental healthcare, which he noted has been well underway for several decades. As Kabat-Zinn explained, research and testimonials from patients and clinicians suggest that we can turn \"the medication down and the meditation up.\" \"We've seen this in the clinical domain for many years. People, in concert with their physicians... actually going off their medications for pain, for anxiety, for depression, as they begin to learn the self-regulatory elements of mindfulness,\" said Kabat-Zinn. \"They discover that the things that used to be symptomatically problematic for them are no longer arising at the same level.\" Advertisement Before You Go Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

How The Shape Of Your Glass Affects Your Drinking Behavior, According To Science How The Shape Of Your Glass Affects Your Drinking Behavior By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post May 9, 2015, 09:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Can something as simple as changing the shape of glasses keep drinkers from going off the rails? New research from England suggests that people drink more slowly when alcohol is served in straight-sided glasses than when it's served in glasses with curved sides. The research, conducted by scientists from the University of Bristol's Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and funded by Alcohol Research UK , also suggests that volume markings on glasses encourage people to drink more slowly. \"Our research suggests that small changes such as glass shape and volume markings can help individuals make more accurate judgments of the volume they are drinking and hopefully drinkers will use this information to drink at a slower pace,\" Dr. Angela Attwood, a research fellow at the university and the senior researcher on the study, said in a written statement. Advertisement Markings vs. no markings. For the study, Attwood and Ph.D. student David Troy recruited 80 men and 80 women with no history of alcohol problems and split them into two groups. The members of one group were given beer in curved glasses with one-quarter, one-half, and three-quarter markings. The other group got beer in curved glasses with no markings. When the researchers looked at how quickly the people in the two groups downed their beer, they found that--after accounting for drinkers described in the statement as \"abnormally slow\"--people with the marked glasses finished their beer in about 10.3 minutes as compared to 9.1 minutes for people with the unmarked glasses. Real-world effects. In an effort to test their ideas in a real-world setting, the researchers had three pubs look at how much beer they sold over two weekends when different kinds of glasses were used. Advertisement When the pubs used straight-sided glasses instead of curved ones, they had lower sales -- which indicated less alcohol consumption, according to the researchers. Given the small number of pubs and the short duration of the tests, the researchers considered the findings preliminary--but valuable nonetheless. \u201cWe now know it is feasible to conduct this type of research in real world situations and this will have implications for future research,\" Troy said in the statement. Hmmm. But if the scientists were impressed with their findings, not everyone was ready to raise a glass to the research. Advertisement \"There's no doubt that context matters when it comes to alcohol and drug use,\" Dr. Anna Lembke, director of Stanford University's Addiction Medicine Program, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"But a study showing that social drinkers with marked glasses drank the same amount of alcohol 1.2 minutes slower than drinkers with unmarked glasses is hardly meaningful.\" Ouch.

Do Genetics Explain the (Sometimes Seen) Relationship Between Television Viewing and Antisocial Behavior? Whether exposure to television violence contributes to antisocial behavior has been an issue of significant controversy for almost five decades. Some studies find evidence for effects, other studies don't, and there is much debate among scholars regarding the meaningfulness and quality of the studies on both sides By Christopher J. Ferguson, Contributor Professor of psychology, media effects researcher and author of speculative fiction. Professor of psychology, media effects researcher and author of speculative fiction.

Whether exposure to television violence contributes to antisocial behavior has been an issue of significant controversy for almost five decades. Some studies find evidence for effects, other studies don't, and there is much debate among scholars regarding the meaningfulness and quality of the studies on both sides. Some scholars have been willing to argue that as much as half of all homicides in the US might be eliminated if childhood exposure to violent television (and other media) were reduced. This debate has also been the source of some \"scientific urban legends\" such as the old claim, repeated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), that 3500 studies of media effects existed by the year 2000 with only18 not finding evidence for harm (it turns out these numbers were apocryphal and don't remotely represent the actual state of the field). Put simply, it's a debate where there's a lot of bad information out there, sometimes promulgated by folks who ought to know better. One of the ongoing questions in this debate is, if small correlations exist between television viewing and antisocial behavior, is this a causal effect of too much television, or are other factors at play? Do more aggressive people seek out more violent television, for instance? On a very simple level boys tend to watch more violent television and are also more aggressive than girls, so any observed correlation may simply be a gender effect. Unfortunately not all studies include appropriate controls (be particularly wary when you read about meta-analyses which routinely report results without any proper controls.) Advertisement One study that got attention back in 2013 (and released by the ever present AAP) was a longitudinal study from New Zealand (henceforth the Kiwi Study ), which presented data suggesting that early television viewing is associated with antisocial behavior in adulthood. The Kiwi study examined overall television viewing, not violent television specifically, but since many media watchdog groups assert that television is soaked in violence, this is probably a fine proxy. The authors deserve credit for also controlling for many other relevant variables such as gender, IQ, parenting environment, etc. Doing so predictably weakened their results...associations between television and violent convictions became non-significant, and associations for any convictions and antisocial personality disorder became small, but remained significant. So for at least two out of three outcomes, television is associated with antisocial traits, albeit weakly. Despite that their data is correlational, the authors purport 'The findings are consistent with a causal association and support the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that children should watch no more than 1 to 2 hours of television each day.' That the AAP arguably has a conflict of interest in publishing research cheerleading their own policy positions is a whole separate issue I hope to get into in a later post. But asserting causality from correlational data is a basic no-no (I also chuckle a bit at a typo in the abstract suggesting some of the people in the study were born in 1773, but I'm typo prone enough myself not to get too much hubris over it). However, a more recent study suggests that the Kiwi Study and others like it failed to control for at least one key variable: genetics. Published by criminologists Joseph Schwartz and Kevin Beaver, this new study is very similar to the Kiwi Study in that it follows a group of youth over time to examine the impact of television viewing in childhood on adult antisocial outcomes. Like the Kiwi Study, the authors control for multiple other variables. Doing so greatly reduces the correlation between television viewing and adult antisocial behavior, but does not eliminate it. Different from the Kiwi Study, Drs. Schwartz and Beaver had access to sibling pairs including twins, allowing for an examination of genetic effects. With genetic effects included, associations between television viewing in childhood and adult antisocial behavior vanished. The authors argue that genetic development is the key causal variable linking both a tendency to view more violent television and engage in later antisocial behavior. Advertisement Controlling for genetics is generally difficult and expensive to do in most studies. But without such data we have to remember we're not seeing the full picture. We also have to remember that the effects we're discussing are very tiny (not, despite more apocryphal claims by the AAP, anywhere similar to important medical outcomes), a fact the scholarly community has been remiss not to be more honest about with the general public. For half a century now, the general public has been hammered over and over by groups like the AAP with hyperbole that television viewing is harmful. The study by Drs. Schwartz and Beaver is just the latest in an increasing array of studies to suggest directly linking media use to antisocial outcomes was a mistake. As the data increasingly turns against causal effects, groups like the AAP will find themselves increasingly out on a limb, given how much of their reputation they have invested in needlessly frightening parents for decades. How they respond to these changes in the zeitgeist in the field and the data coming out will be interesting to watch. It may be as dramatic as a night of television! 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Scientists Know Climate Change Is Happening Here's How Scientists Know Climate Change Is Happening Mark Maslin, University College London \u2014 The Conversation Nov 30, 2015, 02:35 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The Paris climate conference will set nations against each other, and kick off huge arguments over economic policies, green regulations and even personal lifestyle choices . But one thing isn\u2019t up for debate: the evidence for climate change is unequivocal. We still control the future, however, as the magnitude of shifting weather patterns and the frequency of extreme climate events depends on how much more greenhouse gas we emit. We aren\u2019t facing the end of the world as envisaged by many environmentalists in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but if we do nothing to mitigate climate change then billions of people will suffer. Advertisement Causes of climate change Greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit some of the heat radiation given off by the Earth\u2019s surface and warm the lower atmosphere. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, followed by carbon dioxide and methane, and without their warming presence in the atmosphere the Earth\u2019s average surface temperature would be approximately -20\u00b0C. While many of these gases occur naturally in the atmosphere, humans are responsible for increasing their concentration through burning fossil fuels, deforestation and other land use changes. Records of air bubbles in ancient Antarctic ice show us that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are now at their highest concentrations for more than 800,000 years . The black vertical line on right isn't the end of the graph - it's 200 years of rapid CO2 increases. Scripps Institution Evidence for climate change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents six main lines of evidence for climate change . Advertisement We have tracked the unprecedented recent increase in the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases since the beginning of the industrial revolution . We know from laboratory and atmospheric measurements that such greenhouse gases do indeed absorb heat when they are present in the atmosphere. We have tracked significant increase in global temperatures of at least 0.85\u00b0C and a sea level rise of 20cm over the past century . We have analyzed the effects of natural events such as sunspots and volcanic eruptions on the climate, and though these are essential to understand the pattern of temperature changes over the past 150 years, they cannot explain the overall warming trend. We have observed significant changes in the Earth\u2019s climate system including reduced snowfall in the Northern Hemisphere, retreat of sea ice in the Arctic, retreating glaciers on all continents, and shrinking of the area covered by permafrost and the increasing depth of its active layer. All of which are consistent with a warming global climate. We continually track global weather and have seen significant shifts in weather patterns and an increase in extreme events all around the world. Patterns of precipitation (rainfall and snowfall) have changed, with parts of North and South America, Europe and northern and central Asia becoming wetter, while the Sahel region of central Africa, southern Africa, the Mediterranean and southern Asia have become drier. Intense rainfall has become more frequent, along with major flooding. We\u2019re also seeing more heat waves. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) between 1880 and the beginning of 2014, the 19 warmest years on record have all occurred within the past 20 years; and 2015 is set to be the warmest year ever recorded . What the future holds The continued burning of fossil fuels will inevitably lead to further climate warming. The complexity of the climate system is such that the extent of this warming is difficult to predict, particularly as the largest unknown is how much greenhouse gas we keep emitting. Advertisement The IPCC has developed a range of emissions scenarios or Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to examine the possible range of future climate change. Using scenarios ranging from business-as-usual to strong longer-term managed decline in emissions, the climate model projections suggest the global mean surface temperature could rise by between 2.8\u00b0C and 5.4\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century. Even if all the current country pledges submitted to the Paris conference are achieved we would still only just be at the bottom end of this range. Global average surface temperature change. IPCC, Author provided The sea level is projected to rise by between 52cm and 98cm by 2100 , threatening coastal cities, low-lying deltas and small island nations. Snow cover and sea ice are projected to continue to reduce, and some models suggest that the Arctic could be ice-free in late summer by the latter part of the 21st century. Heat waves, droughts, extreme rain and flash flood risks are projected to increase, threatening ecosystems and human settlements, health and security. One major worry is that increased heat and humidity could make physical work outside impossible. Advertisement Global mean sea level rise. IPCC, Author provided Changes in precipitation are also expected to vary from place to place. In the high-latitude regions (central and northern regions of Europe, Asia and North America) the year-round average precipitation is projected to increase, while in most sub-tropical land regions it is projected to decrease by as much as 20%, increasing the risk of drought. In many other parts of the world, species and ecosystems may experience climatic conditions at the limits of their optimal or tolerable ranges or beyond. Human land use conversion for food, fuel, fibre and fodder, combined with targeted hunting and harvesting, has resulted in species extinctions some 100 to 1000 times higher than background rates. Climate change will only speed things up. Advertisement We don\u2019t have much time left This is the challenge our world leaders face. To keep global temperature rise below the agreed 2\u00b0C, global carbon emission must peak in the next decade and from 2070 onward must be negative: we must start sucking out carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Despite 30 years of climate change negotiations there has been no deviation in greenhouse gas emissions from the business-as-usual pathway, so many feel keeping global warming to less than 2\u00b0C will prove impossible. Previous failures, most notably at Copenhagen in 2009, set back meaningful global cuts in emissions by at least a decade. Paris, however, offers a glimmer of hope. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LEAVE A COMMENT Inti St Clair via Getty Images There\u2019s a little girl. Her blue eyes are wide, and she steps up to the microphone. She\u2019s a five-year-old in front of a room full of adult academics, called up to the front of the room because she wanted so badly to share her dreams with us. \u201cUm\u2026hi, I want to be a paleontologist,\u201d she says. Her name is Maia Toenjes. The room of scientists cheers Maia on, asking her questions, treating her like we all wanted to be treated when we were five-year-olds with wide eyes and a deep, deep curiosity about the world. Advertisement This was the power of the Women in Paleontology conference. PaleoFest celebrates rock-digging women who are inspirational scientists The Burpee Museum of Natural History in urban Rockford, Illinois has put on a paleontology conference every year since 1999. The event, known as PaleoFest, has a tradition of incorporating a yearly theme. And this year\u2019s theme - Women in Paleontology - served two purposes: to highlight academic research specifically conducted by women paleontologists, and to inspire the public on the nature and need of museums \u2013 not to mention the need for events like this one. From all walks of life, science drives us A mixture of non-academic paleontology aficionados, paleontology students, and seasoned academics, PaleoFest isn\u2019t your average science conference. No one is given a standard 12-minute time limit to hit the highlights of their work; instead, we have half an hour to gush about how cool our work is, and why it\u2019s relevant. Advertisement Talks are presented by scientists at all levels of their careers, from students to founders in the field. The audience is a mixture of young and old, fans and faculty. It\u2019s a special event, and one thing I heard the speakers and attendees chime in repeatedly was how meaningful and honestly inspiring this meeting was. Breaking ground in a groundbreaking field In the earliest days of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology and other academic paleontological societies, there were few if any women in attendance. Advertisement As the 20th Century paved the way for women to become more visible in the sciences, both women and men started to achieve a balanced ratio at these kinds of conferences. Yet there has never been a meeting like this year\u2019s PaleoFest. Never before has there been a meeting specifically showcasing the work of women in paleontology. And that in itself is groundbreaking. What do we envision when we think of a \u201cscientist\u201d? When I was a little kid, I loved science. I think most children do, if for no other reason than we are all born with an innate sense of discovery. But when I teach students, and especially female students, all too often I see one of two things: either students are convinced they aren\u2019t good at science, or they\u2019re convinced science isn\u2019t something they can pursue, because they don\u2019t see people like them in science fields. Advertisement Now, this disparity can apply to any traditionally underrepresented group in the sciences, spanning minority groups to LGBTQ visibility and so on. I found it striking, however, that this pervasive feeling of \u201cthat can\u2019t be me\u201d was affecting my students\u2019 ability to engage with science as a whole. That\u2019s why conferences like these, conferences that bring together the work of women in the sciences and display that work to the public in a fresh and engaging way, are so significant. From dinosaur droppings to the shape of ancient brains Take some of the topics from the conference, for example. Graduate student Rhiannon LaVine and professor Peg Yacobucci had visitors and academics alike divided into two camps over which animals represented the most charismatic invertebrate fossils \u2013 the bug-like trilobites and the spiraled ammonites. You don\u2019t get that at your average TED talk. Advertisement Paleontologist ReBecca Hunt-Foster described the conservation efforts at a Bureau of Land Management site, where dinosaur tracks are being preserved for generations to come. Families approached the Burpee Museum\u2019s Science Director, Scott Williams, at a local restaurant and asked, in all seriousness, if the \u201cpoop lady\u201d paleontologist had arrived in town \u2013 my former adviser, Dr. Karen Chin, a renowned fossil dropping expert. (Our lab had a great sense of humor.) Paleoneurologist (yes, that\u2019s a thing!) Ashley Morhardt led us through the heart wrenching history of scientist Tilly Edinger; Tilly\u2019s flight from Holocaust-era Germany led her to become one of the founders of the study of ancient animal brains. Jill Scott took us on her journey through the women-dominated workshops to study the structure of Homo naledi , a new branch on the human family tree. And so it went, with plenty of hands-on activities for kids, behind-the-scenes lab tours for visitors, and a remarkable keynote speech by Egyptian paleontologist Hesham Sallam on his stalwart group of women paleontologist graduate students at Mansoura University. Advertisement Not only was PaleoFest entertaining, it may just have sparked the beginning of a coalition of women in STEM with a focus on paleontology. Above all it was great fun to share our thoughts and ideas with colleagues and the public alike. Maia, inspecting the specimens at the Burpee Museum Image via Crystal Toenjes As paleontologists who once stood in that little girl\u2019s shoes, trying to see ourselves in science, we all left the Women in Paleontology conference with more than just a few business cards and research objectives. Advertisement We were, all of us, just like that little girl, once. We wanted to be paleontologists, too. You go, girl. So, you want to be a paleontologist? Start with the basics. Talk to your local museum. Find a field dig . Keep asking questions \u2013 and remember, you\u2019re not alone. \u2015 Taormina (Tara) is a science teacher and paleontologist at The Webb Schools in southern California. Her research has focused on the paleoecological interpretation of trace fossils in New England and the western United States, including dinosaur tracks and coprolites (fossilized droppings). 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What You Need To Know About The Paris Climate Summit It\u2019s do-or-die time for climate change efforts as world leaders converge on the French capital. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 29, 2015, 06:00 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Mike Hewitt via Getty Images On Nov. 30, more than 100 world leaders will gather in Paris in what many consider one of the last remaining attempts to squelch the growing scourge of climate change. They'll be joined by many of the planet's leading scientists, who for decades have urged countries to scale back the emission of greenhouse gases to stave off a slew of unprecedented consequences. The meeting -- the 21st Conference of the Parties , or COP21 -- will feature talks from the leaders of the world's worst polluting countries, namely United States President Barack Obama , Russia's Vladimir Putin, China's Xi Jinping and India's Narendra Modi. Environmentalists hope officials will come away from the summit with a sweeping plan to curb emissions and increase investment in renewable energy without any negative economic impacts, because (good news!) climate action is a sound investment . Advertisement The conference comes at a dire moment. The world has shattered record after climate record, with 2014 ranking as the hottest year in recorded history . The planet's glaciers are melting at the fastest rates ever seen . Underwater, coral reefs are suffering from an assault of bleaching , spurred by ever-warmer oceans. All of these effects have prompted harsh warnings about the potential impact on humanity. Rising seas from melting glaciers could inundate some of the world's largest metropolises. Warmer summers could force the evacuation of certain cities that may see days with a heat index upwards of 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Advertisement And yet, there is still time to act. Those attending the meeting hope to hash out an actionable strategy to limit emissions below a warming threshold that, scientists agree, would ward off the worst of the predicted threats. That level -- 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial temperatures -- is a contentious number , but the conference reflects growing awareness that climate change is a very real problem. Obama said he was \" optimistic \" the world will reach an outcome this time, as past meetings have failed to turn up a policy that pleases everyone . Several big polluters have demanded nations tackle the burden equally despite some countries, like China and India, contributing far more emissions than others. Those suffering from the brunt of negative effects -- like the low-lying island nation of Kiribati, which is quickly sinking under rising seas -- have in turn blamed the big emitters. Advertisement But Obama's optimism seems to reflect a shift in international attention toward the problem. Organizations from the United Nations to the Vatican have come out in favor of an accord, and those nations traditionally antagonistic towards climate action -- such as Russia and Australia -- will be in attendance in Paris. While Americans remain largely unconcerned about climate change, much of the world is ready to adapt. As the European Union's climate chief said earlier this year, there is \" no plan B \" if the conference ends in failure.

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 30, 2016, 07:55 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT President-elect Donald Trump's administration needs to \u201csupport and rely on science as a key input for crafting public policy,\" the scientists wrote. Mike Segar / Reuters More than 2,300 scientists, including 22 Nobel Prize recipients, have a warning for Donald Trump : Respect science or prepare for a fight . In an open letter Wednesday to the president-elect and Congress, scientists representing all 50 states called on the incoming administration to sufficiently fund scientific research as well as \u201csupport and rely on science as a key input for crafting public policy.\u201d Advertisement Anything short of that, they stressed, is a direct threat to the health and safety of Americans and people around the world. \u201cThe consequences are real: without this investment, children will be more vulnerable to lead poisoning, more people will be exposed to unsafe drugs and medical devices, and we will be less prepared to limit the impacts of increasing extreme weather and rising seas,\u201d the letter reads. The letter, organized by the Union of Concerned Scientists , comes amid growing concern about what a Trump presidency will mean for combatting today\u2019s environmental challenges, namely climate change. Advertisement Trump and his fellow climate deniers have made it quite clear where they stand on the phenomenon and funding its continued study. Trump has dismissed climate change as \u201c bullshit \u201d and a Chinese \u201c hoax ,\u201d and promised to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris climate agreement . He has also said he would cut all federal spending on the issue , increase America\u2019s production of coal, oil and natural gas, and do away with Obama administration regulations aimed at cutting emissions. \u201cRespect for science in policymaking should be a prerequisite for any Cabinet position.\u201d - physicist Lewis Branscomb In the weeks since the election, Trump has only added to scientists\u2019 concerns by selecting climate change denier Myron Ebell and fossil fuel lobbyist Mike McKenna to lead transition work at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and oil executive Harold Hamm are front-runners to head the Interior Department, and Trump\u2019s senior adviser on space policy wants to eliminate NASA\u2019s research into climate change . Advertisement The letter, published Wednesday, features an impressive list of signatories, including David Baltimore , president emeritus of the California Institute of Technology; Eric Chivian , the founder and director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School; and Wolfgang Ketterle , a German physicist and professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The scientists call on Trump and the 115th Congress to \u201cadhere to high standards of scientific integrity and independence in responding to current and emerging public health and environmental threats.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In a news release on the letter, Lewis Branscomb , a physicist and professor at the University of California, San Diego, said: \u201cAmericans recognize that science is critical to improving our quality of life, and when science is ignored or politically corrupted, it\u2019s the American people who suffer . Respect for science in policymaking should be a prerequisite for any Cabinet position.\u201d Advertisement The group also promised to keep a close eye on Trump \u2015 and fight back if necessary. \u201cWe will continue to champion efforts that strengthen the role of science in policy making and stand ready to hold accountable any who might seek to undermine it,\u201d the letter states.
