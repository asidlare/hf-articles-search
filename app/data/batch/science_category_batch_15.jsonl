Positive Results From Brain Games May Be Just A Placebo Effect A new study deals a blow to the billion-dollar industry. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jun 21, 2016, 11:29 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Diamond Sky Images via Getty Images The brain-training apps that promise to improve memory and boost your IQ may have nothing more than a placebo effect, according to a new study. The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Monday, found that people perform better in intelligence tests if they expect brain-training games to help them. Advertisement There's already growing debate over the efficacy of products that claim to train people's brains. The burgeoning industry -- which was forecast to make $6 billion by 2020 -- is already taking hits. The Federal Trade Commission fined the company behind the brain training program Lumosity $2 million in January for deceptive advertising. Lumosity sold game subscriptions to its 70 million customers ranging from monthly payments of $14.95 to lifetime memberships for $299.95, marketing the games as tools to keep the brain sharp and healthy. But the FTC said the program \u201c preyed on consumers\u2019 fears about age-related cognitive decline,\u201d and it \u201csimply did not have the science to back up its ads.\u201d Matters are not any less turbulent in the scientific community. In 2014 , about 70 neuroscientists signed an open letter pointing out the lack of scientific evidence for claims about positive effects of brain games. Another group of scientists have argued in response that \u201ca substantial and growing body of evidence shows that certain cognitive training regimens can significantly improve cognitive function.\u201d Studies showing the brain-train games work may be inherently biased from selecting participants who expected to get smarter by playing brain games, according to Cyrus Foroughi, who co-authored the latest research pointing to evidence of a placebo effect. Advertisement \u201cPlaceboes are very pervasive and they have to be controlled for in a tremendous number of fields. This field is no different,\u201d the George Mason University researcher told The Huffington Post. \u201cSo we put together the study to actually test whether expectation for a positive effect can lead to a positive outcome.\u201d Foroughi and his colleagues put up flyers around the campus inviting students to take part in their research. Half of the flyers were highly suggestive, mentioning brain training and cognitive enhancement. The other half were standard, generic ads that didn\u2019t mention the type of study. Two different flyers used to recruit study participants. Placebo effects in cognitive training, Forooghi et al., PNAS, 2016. DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1601243113 Advertisement Both groups, each made up of 25 volunteers, did a pre-test to measure their baseline intelligence. They then played a game involving a task called dual n-back for an hour. This task aims to engage and train working memory. The next day, the participants returned to the lab for a second intelligence test. Previous research, including a meta-analysis of 20 studies published in 2014, had suggested that training working memory could improve intelligence -- particularly the fluid type of intelligence that refers to problem-solving abilities and using logic. The participants who had responded to the suggestive flyer showed improvement at the second intelligence test amounting to a 5- to 10-point increase on a standard IQ test. The other group, however, showed no improvements, according to the study. Advertisement This placebo effect may have infiltrated a considerable body of research on brain training. Foroughi\u2019s team contacted authors of 19 studies and found 17 of them in some way had introduced bias; they mentioned brain training, for example, or used a set of words that could have influenced the participants, Foroughi said. Many researchers purposely do this to get motivated participants because people who are interested in playing brain games are more likely to take part than those who have no interest, he added. To account for the bias, researchers divide their participants into two group. One group plays the real game while the other group plays a fake game or some similar alternative. They then subtract the improvements. This study design may seem logical at first glance. And it seems to be the type of design that Lumosity has used in its research. \u201cOur scientists had 4,715 participants complete the study,\" the company states on its website. \"Half trained with Lumosity, while the rest did online crossword puzzles to control for placebo effects. After 10 weeks, the Lumosity group improved more than the crosswords group on an aggregate assessment of cognition.\u201d Advertisement But the new finding that just expecting to get smarter might make people test better questions the real reason behind people\u2019s improvements in those studies. Lumosity said in a statement to HuffPost: The recent study on placebo effects in cognitive training is interesting and underscores the importance of proper study design, suggesting that appropriately accounting for confounds such as self-selection bias and expectancy effects should be an important aspect of study design. Lumosity is built on the philosophy that intrinsic motivation is essential to users\u2019 training experience, and in the 2015 study \u201c Enhancing Cognitive Abilities with Comprehensive Training: A Large, Online, Randomized, Active-Controlled Trial ,\u201d researchers were interested in studying cognitive training\u2019s effects in users who\u2019d demonstrated motivation and recruited participants accordingly. To mitigate placebo effects, the study used crossword puzzles as an active control. While there are always limitations to any given study, we welcome all research that serves to improve the quality of cognitive training research and, subsequently, the products available. Other popular brain-training products include Happy Neuron , which has about 11 million users; Rosetta Stone's Fit Brains and The British Cogmed , which has games for children and students to improve learning. Neuronation , which has 7 million members, even claims that \u201cworking memory is directly related to intelligence -- the more you train, the smarter you can be.\u201d While the new finding doesn't prove that none of these brain training programs work, it does provide an alternative explanation for effects observed in the cognitive-training research and the brain-training industry, \"revealing the need to account for confounds in future research,\u201d Foroughi and his colleagues wrote in their study. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Jacky Au of University of California, Irvine, who authored the 2014 meta-analysis, agrees that a placebo effect \"almost certainly\" exists, but points out that we don't know if it explains all of the improvement people see from brain games. \"The critical question is to parcel out the relative contributions of placebo and training,\" Au told HuffPost. Advertisement Foroughi said the George Mason University study doesn't mean the debate is over. \"I think we are moving in the right direction, getting better data and eliminating possible confounders like placebo effects,\" he said. \"The brain training industry is growing. It may or may not work but we need a lot more evidence before we come to something conclusive.\u201d Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

New NASA Photo Shows A Crescent Pluto In All Its Glory The backlit image gives us a new look at the dwarf planet. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Oct 31, 2015, 10:24 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This image was taken just 15 minutes after New Horizons' closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, as the spacecraft looked back at the dwarf planet, toward the sun. NASA A new image of Pluto can be described with one word: breathtaking. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured the stunning photo, which shows the dwarf planet's crescent, just 15 minutes after making its closest approach in July. The photo, which was released by the space agency on Thursday, was taken by the spacecraft's Multispectral Imaging Camera at just 11,000 miles away from the dwarf planet. Advertisement The backlighting provided by the sun highlights Pluto's thin atmosphere , which scientists recently found to be blue, and illuminates the dwarf planet's icy plain, nicknamed Sputnik Planum or \"Pluto's heart,\" which is bordered by mountains. Pluto's stunning crescent was captured before in a jaw-dropping photo (below), which was released in September . The New Horizons spacecraft also captured this near-sunset view of the rugged, icy mountains and flat ice plains extending to Pluto's horizon after making its closest approach on July 14, 2015.

'Sophisticated Evaluation of Serious Research' at the New York Times? Some editors at theseem to have either developed a severe case of institutional amnesia, or decided to confer the presumption of innocence upon cellphone radiation, as the newspaper did upon asbestos for an entire decade after the mineral had been shown to be the most important industrial carcinogen in the world. By Paul Brodeur, Contributor Fmr. staff writer at The New Yorker Fmr. staff writer at The New Yorker Mar 28, 2015, 09:12 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. On March 19, Nick Bilton, technology columnist at The New York Times , wrote an article in the newspaper entitled \"New Gadgets, New Health Worries.\" Approximately half of the piece was about the possible health hazards posed by the new Apple Watch and other smart watches; the other half concerned the health hazards associated with the use of cellphones. \"We have long suspected that cellphones, which give off low levels of radiation, could lead to brain tumors, cancer, disturbed blood rhythms, and other health problems if held too close to the body for extended periods,\" Bilton wrote. Later in his column, he declared that the most definitive and unbiased findings leading to this suspicion had come from the conclusions of a panel of 31 scientists from 14 nations that had been convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is part of the World Health Organization, located in Lyon, France. Bilton described the panel's findings as follows: \"After dissecting dozens of peer-reviewed studies on cellphone safety, the panel concluded in 2011 that cellphones were 'possibly carcinogenic' and that the devices could be as harmful as certain dry-cleaning chemicals and pesticides.\" He cited the results of one of these studies, which had been conducted by the well known Swedish oncologist and epidemiologist Dr. Lennart Hardell, who had found that prolonged use of cell phones could \"triple\" the risk of developing a certain type of brain cancer, and that cell phone radiation might be especially harmful to the developing brains of children. Advertisement Toward the end of his column, Bilton told his readers that he had \"stopped holding my cell phone next to my head and instead use a headset.\" Within hours, Bilton was taken to the woodshed by none other than Margaret Sullivan, the Times ' public editor, who, according to the newspaper, \"investigates matters of journalistic integrity.\" Sullivan posted a blog in which she scolded Bilton for writing about a complicated subject without keeping in mind that \"extra checking and caution is in order.\" She went on to say that although he is a columnist with plenty of leeway for expressing opinion, \"the careful interpretation of facts still matters\" -- something she claimed was lacking in his piece. \"The column clearly needed much more vetting,\" she declared, \"at least some of which could have been done internally at The Times .\" She made no mention of Bilton's emphasis of the fact that scientists on the panel convened by the IARC had concluded that cellphone radiation was a possible carcinogen. Advertisement Apparently convinced that Bilton deserved further censure, an Editors' Note appeared, on March 21, in the Corrections section of The Times , declaring that his column \"gave an inadequate account of the status of research about cellphone radiation and cancer risk.\" The note said, \"Neither epidemiological nor laboratory studies have found reliable evidence of such risks...\" It went on to claim, \"According to the World Health Organization, 'To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.'\" The Editors' Note made no mention of the conclusion of the panel of 31 scientists organized by the IARC in 2011, who had determined that cellphone radiation was \"possibly carcinogenic,\" or of the fact that the Agency is part of the World Health Organization. Examination of The Times ' website reveals that on May 31, 2011, two of the newspaper's reporters, Tara Parker-Pope and Felicity Barringer, posted a three-page article entitled \"Cellphone Radiation May Cause Cancer, Advisory Panel Says.\" The article described the conclusions of the very same panel of 31 scientists convened by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer that Bilton described in his column almost four years later. Parker-Pope and Barringer said that the panel had been led by Dr. Jonathan M. Samet, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Southern California, who was a member of President Obama's National Cancer Advisory Board. Their article stated that during a press conference, \"Dr. Samet said the panel's decision to classify cellphones as 'possibly carcinogenic' was based largely on epidemiological data showing an increased risk among heavy cellphone users of a rare type of [brain] tumor called a glioma.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Freaky 'Terminator'-Style Material May Lead To Safer Space Travel You simply can't leave a hole in this stuff. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Sep 2, 2015, 11:39 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have developed a \"Terminator\"-style material that instantly heals itself if it's pierced by a fast-moving object. If you find that hard to believe, have a look at a new video (above) that shows what happens when the material is pierced by a bullet. The material could make space and air travel safer. If a fast-moving micrometeoroid or space debris were to puncture the wall of a spacecraft, for instance, the new material could instantly plug the hole within seconds -- before air inside the spacecraft leaks out. Hasta la vista, baby. Advertisement (Story continues below.) \"The purpose of the material in spacecraft is to mitigate and ideally completely prevent disastrous atmosphere loss,\" Dr. Timothy Scott, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the lead author of a paper describing the material, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Self-healing materials offer tremendous advantages over more conventional, static structures in terms of their ability to recover from deleterious, though non-catastrophic, events, which in turn could significantly increase their useful lifetime.\" The material is made of two polymer sheets with a liquid in between. The liquid -- a resin known by the tongue-twisting name \"thiol-ene trialkylborane\" -- hardens instantly when exposed to oxygen. Advertisement This isn't the first \"self-healing\" plastic , New Scientist reported. Other materials, however, take much longer to repair themselves. The paper was published online in the journal ACS Macro Letters on July 27, 2015. The new material was discussed during HuffPost Live's Nerds Forum segment on Tuesday -- check out the discussion below. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Study Predicts Grim Future For Hawaii's Rarest Forest Birds More bad news out of the \"extinction capital of the world.\" By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Oct 30, 2015, 09:53 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Millions of years ago, songbirds somehow managed to make their way to Hawaii, eventually evolving into dozens of unique species perfectly adapted to their isolated tropical paradise. But Hawaii has often been called the \" extinction capital of the world ,\" and a new study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE is predicting even more trouble for some of the world's rarest birds. Researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey found that without immediate and proactive conservation measures , climate change and disease could completely wipe out the 'Akeke'e and 'Akikiki , two species of honeycreepers, and the secretive Puaiohi , or Small Kauai Thrush. Advertisement All three are endangered -- each with a population of fewer than 1,000 -- and are found only in a 25-square-kilometer area of the Alakai Swamp on Kauai, the oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands. The 'Akeke'e, a greenish-yellow honeycreeper, is endemic to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Jim Denny This isn't exactly a new problem. The arrival of Polynesians in A.D. 400, followed by westerners in 1778, caused destruction of native forest habitat and the introduction of alien species, including malaria-carrying mosquitos, feral ungulates and predators like rats and feral cats. Advertisement Since the arrival of humans to the islands, 71 of Hawaii's 113 endemic bird species have gone extinct , according to the American Bird Conservancy. Thirty-three of Hawaii's remaining 42 endemic birds are listed as endangered species. On Kauai, seven of the island's original 13 forest birds have disappeared , including five since the 1960s. But the U.S. Geological Survey found that if climate change and loss of habitat continues unchecked, 10 of the 20 remaining forest bird species in the state could lose more than 50 percent of their habitat by 2100. Furthermore, six are projected to lose more than 90 percent, while the three Kauai species -- 'Akeke'e, 'Akikiki and Puaiohe -- could lose everything. Advertisement The 'I'iwi features a long, decurved pink bill, used to feed on nectar. Lucas Behnke Researchers used a species sightings database, regional climate projections and distribution models to reach their conclusions, but also noted that there is hope. \"As dire as these findings are, they do not mean that these bird species are doomed ,\" lead author Dr. Lucas Fortini, a research ecologist with USGS, said in a press release. \"Instead, our findings indicate what may happen if nothing is done to address the primary drivers of decline: disease spreading uphill into the few remaining refuges.\" Advertisement Conservation efforts, the study says, must include efforts to interrupt the cycle of malaria transmission and mortality. Such actions could include \"vector control and genetic modification of both birds and mosquitos.\" Dr. Lisa Crampton, project leader of the Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project , told The Huffington Post that while climate change is a real threat to these species, she thinks the study may be \"overly pessimistic.\" \"There's a lot more we can do about habitat than we can about disease,\" including trapping predators, which her group is already doing, she said. Advertisement As for disease, Crampton and her team have identified several populations of birds on Kauai that are developing resistance to avian diseases on their own. The secretive Puaiohi, also known as the Small Kauai Thrush, is highly endangered, with a population of around 500 individuals. Lucas Behnke In a statement Wednesday, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources Chairwoman Suzanne Case said these birds are \" integral to the overall health and well-being \" of Hawaii's forests and represent the unique, interconnected and threatened nature of Hawaii\u2019s lands. Advertisement \"We can't afford the extinction of more species,\" she said. The full study can be viewed here . The Kauai 'Amakihi is a small, olive-green honeycreeper.

Here's How Long It Would Take To Fall Through The Center Of Earth Here's How Long It Would Take To Fall Through The Center Of Earth By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 28, 2015, 10:50 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Cutaway artwork showing the internal structure of the Earth. Below the outer rocky layer (lithosphere), a zone of near-molten rock called the mantle (red) extends down to 2900 kilometres (km). Mantle material rises to form new lithosphere at mid-ocean ridg Just how long would it take to fall through the center of the Earth, traveling from one side of our planet to the other? Physicists have long calculated the answer to that question as being 42 minutes , but now, new calculations show that the theoretical trip would actually take around 38 minutes -- and we can blame gravity for the discrepancy . Advertisement The traditional calculation to measure a fall through Earth assumes that our planet has a constant density throughout its many layers. Since the gravitational attraction between two objects is proportional to their masses (or density) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them , if Earth's density were constant, the only change in gravity we'd experience would be due to how far we were from Earth's center. But as Alexander Klotz, a graduate student at McGill University in Canada , came up with the new calculations, he took into consideration how Earth's density changes layer by layer. And as a result, the gravitational speed at which we would fall through each layer changed too. Klotz measured the different densities found in Earth's interior using seismic data. Indeed, our planet has a less dense crust and mantle and a more dense core , Science magazine reported. Advertisement A paper describing the new thought experiment results was published in the March 2015 issue of the American Journal of Physics . \"This is the kind of paper we love,\" Dr. David Jackson, editor of the journal and a physicist at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, told Science magazine. \"This is a nice addition to the classic problem.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Spermbots' Are A Thing, And They Could Boost Fertility These tiny robots can deliver poor swimmers to an egg, scientists say. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 14, 2016, 04:53 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT In almost half of couples who are struggling to have a baby, the male partner plays a role in the infertility -- and one of the main causes of infertility in men includes sperm that might not swim well enough to make their way to an egg. Now, researchers in Germany have found a way to use tiny robots to help sperm swim more quickly and efficiently. A video (above) released by the American Chemical Society describes how \"spermbots\" could someday lead to a novel treatment for male infertility. Advertisement The \"spermbots\" are actually micro metal motors that can wrap around a sperm cell and help propel it to an egg, according to a new study published in the journal Nano Letters on Wednesday. The researchers found that the movements of bot, which were tested in a petri dish, can be remote-controlled from outside the body with the help of a magnetic field . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Man Flu' Stories Show How We Make Women's Health All About Dudes A new study had important findings for women, but all we heard about was \"man flu.\" By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jan 15, 2016, 01:47 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT This guy looks like he has a bad case of the \"man flu.\" IPGGutenbergUKLtd/Getty Images Whiny men might be excited by recent news stories that claim \u201cman flu\u201d -- the trope that men turn into bedridden drama kings at the slightest hint of a sniffle -- is real and totally justified because men have a harder time fighting off the flu. These headlines are based on a recent study that suggests estrogen could play a role in flu resistance. But the lead researcher said it's a huge \"leap in logic\" to say this proves anything about \"man flu,\" and she emphasized that her study really doesn\u2019t have much to do with guys, whiny or otherwise. Advertisement \u201cI find it so interesting that [my research] got misrepresented to be all about men,\u201d said Sabra Klein, associate professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. What Klein and her team did find is that adding estrogen to nasal cells -- the cells typically infected by influenza -- helped stop the virus from replicating in cells from women, but not cells from men. That\u2019s because only the female cells express estrogen receptors, which estrogen needs to bind to. Researcher Sabra Klein said her team's recent study demonstrates why looking at estrogen's effect on the whole body, and not just the reproductive system, is an important women\u2019s health issue. Zerbor/Getty Images Advertisement It\u2019s easy to understand why some journalists took this to mean that women, as a whole, must be better equipped to fight off the flu. After all, if women have more estrogen, and estrogen fights the flu, they must have an advantage, right? But Klein said it\u2019s not that simple. Her team's study looked at the effects of a constant, consistent level of estrogen, comparable to what women taking hormone replacement therapy or some forms of hormonal birth control would experience. But women who are not on such treatments have estrogen levels that cycle up and down. \u201cWomen are not just a constant bag of estrogen,\u201d Klein explained. \u201cThe concentrations of these hormones are changing.\u201d Advertisement Plus, since researchers were only working with cells, not living human beings, they can\u2019t even say for sure whether women taking birth control or hormone therapy have increased flu resistance. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an exciting finding, though. Klein said the study shows why researching estrogen's effect on the whole body, and not just the reproductive system, is an important women\u2019s health issue. \u201cEstrogens are affecting more than just reproduction,\u201d she said. Estrogen\u2019s flu-fighting potential could be especially crucial for older, post-menopausal women who are considering taking hormone replacement therapy. Elderly women are more susceptible to the flu, and vaccines tend to be less effective for them, said Klein. Advertisement She added that she didn\u2019t foresee a future in which women would take estrogen solely for flu protection, but said it could be a factor when they weigh their options. \u201cI view it more that these are added benefits, as opposed to \u2026 encouraging everybody to take these hormones,\u201d Klein said.

The launch was later scrubbed. YouTube/SpaceX UPDATE, Feb. 28: SpaceX aborted the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket for a third time on Sunday night. The space technologies company went ahead with the countdown, scrubbing the launch seconds before liftoff. A new launch date has not been released. Advertisement Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. , or SpaceX, had previously a delayed a launch of the Falcon 9 rocket that was scheduled for Thursday night. SpaceX delayed the launch over concerns with the rocket's propellant, according to a webcast from the company. It decided to postpone the launch less than two minutes before the rocket was scheduled for takeoff. John Insprucker, Falcon 9's product director, said at the end of the live webcast that they would try another attempt, \u201chopefully within another couple of days.\" Advertisement Falcon 9 is fine, but propellant may have been an issue. @SpaceX hasn't picked a new launch day. @news965wdbo \u2014 Joe Ruble (@JoeRubleWDBO) February 25, 2016 The main goal of the launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, was to deliver a commercial communications satellite called SES-9 into orbit for the company SES . A secondary objective of the event was to land the 14-story rocket booster upright on a floating, football field-sized drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You. However, SpaceX has said \" a successful landing is not expected ,\" and predicted its fourth at-sea landing attempt would end much like the previous three: in flames . Advertisement A SpaceX landing off the coast of California ended in flames last month after a successful launch to deploy an international ocean-monitoring satellite . In December, however, SpaceX made history when a Falcon 9 landed successfully on the ground about 6 miles from where it took off. Musk called it a \" revolutionary \" moment and a \"critical step along the way to being able to establish a city on Mars.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In a dramatic, film trailer-esque video released this week, the space agency detailed its nail-biting final approach to exploring Jupiter. NASA\u2019s JUpiter Near-polar Orbiter ( Juno ) is scheduled to enter the gas giant's orbit on July 4. It will be the first time a spacecraft has come so close to the \u201cbiggest and baddest planet in the solar system,\u201d NASA said. Advertisement In the video, images of Jupiter flash across the screen as ominous music and dramatic utterances are heard in the background. \u201cIt\u2019s a monster. It\u2019s unforgiving. It\u2019s relentless,\u201d said a voice-over of the fifth planet from the sun. Advertisement If all goes well, Juno will study Jupiter\u2019s thick atmosphere and map its gravity field, among other aims. NASA hopes the mission will also offer insights into the origin and evolution of the planet, as well as the solar system as a whole. The spacecraft will be exposed to many hazards, including extreme radiation, but the agency said it\u2019s \u201cready\u201d to deal with these challenges. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

ETs Could Reach Out To Us With Interstellar Lasers Columbia University astronomers suggest a new way we might grab the attention of alien civilizations. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Jun 17, 2016, 10:54 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An artist's depiction of planetary discoveries by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which searches for Earth-like planets. The Kepler telescope has discovered thousands of verified planets since it launched in 2009. NASA / W. Stenzel For decades, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has looked and listened for evidence of another civilization in our galactic neighborhood. That hunt is intensifying with NASA's Kepler telescope's discovery of thousands of verified planets since its 2009 launch, including some planets that appear Earth-like and possibly habitable. Advertisement Now, a Columbia University astronomer has an idea for making Earth stand out to any alien civilization that may be conducting similar searches for planets -- aiming laser beams through the vast distance that separates us in this region of the Milky Way galaxy. \"We mostly use the transit method, which is currently the most successful and dominant method of detecting planets,\" said Columbia's David Kipping . \"Very simply, it works by staring at a star -- you can't see the planets directly, because they just reflect too little light or they're too close to their star. Now and again, the planet sometimes will pass in front of the star, blocking some of the star light for a short amount of time.\" Essentially the star \"winks\" at us, the first visual clue that a planet may be passing in front of it. An advanced extraterrestrial race could, in a similar way, detect Earth as they see a dip in the brightness of our sun as our planet passes in front of it every 365 days on our orbital path. Advertisement But there's a way Earth could make its appearance stand out to other civilizations -- and a way ETs could send an unmistakeable sign to Earth, Kipping said. \"An alien civilization might choose to try and make their transit signature -- as seen by Earth -- look weird or funky. One thing they might do is turn on a laser beam and make any pattern they want in the transit signature,\" said Kipping. The kind of laser-created patterns Kipping talks about are geometric forms -- circles, squares, triangles, even a laser-based city skyline -- anything totally unexpected that our scientists, and the Kepler telescope, would notice. Advertisement \"This has lots of advantages,\" Kipping added. \"We are already looking for their signature. Somehow, if they follow the same path of detecting planets, they would perhaps assume this very simple method might be one way to broadcast themselves.\" The idea of deliberately trying to make our presence known to other civilizations is the subject of some debate. Leading those who say Earth shouldn't reach out and say hello to the cosmos is renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who warns that aliens might not have the best intentions for earthlings. With that in mind, Kipping and Columbia graduate student Alan Teachey wrote a paper explaining how laser technology may be useful to cloak our planet from the prying eyes of those in deep space who would do us harm. Advertisement They put together this video to make their point: Are you for or against the idea of letting other advanced cultures know we're here? Kipping said the idea of whether humans are alone in the universe is perhaps our species' ultimate question. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It's impossible for us to foresee how that could change our society,\" Kipping said. \"There's over 2,000 confirmed planets, and we definitely have examples, no matter how you slice and dice it, of planets which resemble Earth in the Kepler data.

Alien Contact Is Still 1,500 Years Away, Cornell Researchers Say But scientists searching for ETs aren't waiting around. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Jun 22, 2016, 07:02 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Teddy Sczudlo via Getty Images If you're hoping to see the day when earthlings finally make formal contact with an extraterrestrial civilization, don't hold your breath. You may have to wait about 1,500 years, two Cornell University astronomy researchers say. \"Space is so immensely, mindbogglingly big that, even at the speed of light, it takes an incredible amount of time for a communication to reach anywhere -- to any significant portion of the galaxy,\" Evan Solomonides, a Cornell physics and math major, told The Huffington Post. Advertisement Solomonides and Yervant Terzian, a Cornell astronomy professor, co-authored a paper that Solomonides presented last week at the American Astronomical Society in San Diego, California. Their research focuses on something called the Fermi paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi. In the 1950s, Fermi raised the question that if, as many scientists believe, there are huge numbers of technological civilizations out there, why haven't earthlings seen tangible evidence? In their paper, the Cornell researchers wrote: \"We clearly show that human communication has reached a sphere with a radius of roughly 80 light years, and has not reached a number of stars and planets adequate to expect an answer. \"It is actually unlikely that the Earth would have been reached at all thus far, and we do not anticipate to be reached until approximately 50 percent of stars/planets have been reached. We offer a prediction that we should not expect this until at least 1,500 years in the future. \"Thus, the Fermi paradox is not a shocking observation -- or lack thereof -- and humanity may very well be contacted within our species' lifespan.\" A breathtaking Hubble telescope image of a small portion of the night sky, showing about 10,000 galaxies, each of which has upwards of billions of suns with countless billions of planets. NASA, ESA, CalTech, Arizona State U. Advertisement Solomonides and Terzian also consider something known as the mediocrity principle, which suggests that earthlings -- compared with life that may exist in the Milky Way galaxy in which we live -- aren't that special. \"Whatever natural processes gave rise to life on our planet should be extraordinarily common, and should have happened in enumerable places throughout the galaxy,\" the scientists wrote. \"Yet, we are, to the best of our knowledge thus far, utterly alone. How can this be?\" Solomonides said the search for extraterrestrial intelligence by the California-based SETI Institute, which is trying to locate a definitive ET signal from outer space, is the best chance to find alien neighbors. Advertisement \"I think what SETI has been doing is exactly what we should be doing, because if we stop looking and listening for a second, we could miss it when it finally comes,\" Solomonides said. \"If we stopped paying attention for a year, a month or a week -- if that is when we finally get a signal, the one powerful signal from a civilization that indicates that they're there -- we've missed it and there's no way to ever get that back, so we have to keep looking and trying.\" Scientists scan the night skies around Earth with special radio telescopes, like this array in Atacama, Chile. ALMA/ESO/ C. Malin Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, said searchers look for definitive ET signs. Advertisement \"Our experiments listen for alien signals that are relentless -- you can find them repeatedly,\" Shostak told HuffPost in an email. \"Otherwise, who knows what you've picked up?\" \"Perhaps the extraterrestrials aren't going to spend the money to broadcast our way until they've heard from us, and know of our existence,\" he said. \"If so, it could be a long time before such a targeted signal is transmitted to Earth. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

On Wednesday, the European Southern Observatory (ESO) unveiled a stunning new image of the Milky Way\u2019s galactic plane taken by the APEX telescope in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. A composite of more than 700 observations captured by the telescope, it\u2019s the most detailed image ever created of our galaxy from the Southern hemisphere, and the first time that the southern Milky Way has been shown at the submillimeter wavelengths between infrared light and radio waves: Advertisement ESO/APEX/ATLASGAL CONSORTIUM/NASA/GLIMPSE CONSORTIUM/ESA/PLANCK Submillimeter telescopes are useful for observing very cold and dusty regions of the universe, such as the gas clumps floating throughout our galaxy from which new stars are born . These star-forming regions are \u201coften dark and obscured due to the dust,\u201d the ESO stated, but they \u201cshine brightly in the millimeter and submillimeter part of the spectrum.\u201d \u201cWe can for the first time get a full census of the star-forming regions within our own galaxy ,\u201d ESO scientist Carlos De Breuck told CNN . \u201cThis allows us to find all such regions and to study their properties.\u201d Advertisement Watch the video below to get a closer look at the Milky Way map, or explore the entire, zoomable 187 million pixel image for yourself: Called the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL), the mapping of the Milky Way was conducted between July 2007 and November 2010.

SeaWorld Dispatched Employees To Infiltrate Animal Rights Groups Unsurprisingly, PETA is not pleased. By Lydia O'Connor Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 25, 2016, 03:28 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Mike Blake / Reuters SeaWorld had employees pose as animal rights activists to collect information for the company after it reportedly received threats, the wildlife theme park announced Thursday. It said it has stopped the practice. \"Following the completion of an investigation conducted by independent outside counsel, the Board has directed that the company\u2019s management team end a practice in which certain employees posed as animal rights activists in connection with efforts to maintain the safety and security of company employees, customers, and animals in the face of credible threats that the company had received,\" SeaWorld said in a statement . Advertisement SeaWorld did not specify the nature of the threats in the statement. However, many animal rights campaigns have targeted the company since the 2013 release of \"Blackfish,\" a film that sheds a negative light on its killer whale exhibits. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an organization that has been a longtime critic of the park, alleged last year that a man working on its anti-SeaWorld campaigns who went by the name \"Thomas Jones\" was actually Paul McComb, a SeaWorld employee since 2008. Advertisement SeaWorld didn't outright deny the accusation at the time. \"We are focused on the safety of our team members, guests and animals, and beyond that we do not comment on our security operations,\" spokesman Fred Jacobs said in July. \"This is a responsibility that we take very seriously, especially as animal rights groups have become increasingly extreme in their rhetoric and tactics.\u201d McComb was placed on administrative leave but has since returned to SeaWorld in a different department, the park said in its statement on Thursday. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

PETA executive vice president Tracy Reiman blasted SeaWorld in light of the revelation. \"SeaWorld's latest report confirms not only that the company has employed more than one spy to infiltrate and agitate at PETA but also that it values its spies more highly than the executives who have had their heads chopped off in droves, as at least one of the spies is still working at the company,\" she said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post, alluding a SeaWorld leadership shakeup last week, when the chief parks operations officer, chief zoological officer and San Antonio park director were all replaced. Advertisement The company's shares plummeted on Thursday following a morning earnings call in which the company projected minimal financial growth for the year ahead.

NASA Looking Toward Manned Mission To Mars 'Sometime In The 2030s' The agency first wants to learn various lessons by sending humans back to the moon. By Andy McDonald Writer, HuffPost Nov 25, 2018, 03:51 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT . @NASA \u2019s Steve Clarke says we might see manned missions to Mars by late 2030. pic.twitter.com/ov1yawHizJ \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) November 25, 2018 First the moon, and then the world! ... Just not our world. On CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d Sunday, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Steve Clarke said the space agency is looking to get humans to Mars sometime in the 2030s. But first, he said, the agency needs to train and refine techniques for Mars by having humans go back to the moon in about 10 years. Advertisement NASA is currently focused on its latest Mars probe, InSight, which is scheduled to touch down on the planet\u2019s surface Monday. \u201cWe continue to perfect landing techniques using robotic landers on Mars,\u201d Clarke said. \u201dAnd certainly we\u2019re going to be using that technology to develop landers to return to the moon with humans first.\u201d Such moon expeditions, Clarke said, will not only give NASA a chance to \u201clearn our lessons\u201d on a non-Earth body, but it is also far closer than Mars. The moon is a very manageable three days travel from Earth. Mars? About nine months . Advertisement The first human exploration of Mars will come \u201cafter we\u2019ve established our presence on the moon on a more permanent basis than we have in the past,\u201d he said. The last time NASA sent humans to the moon was 1972, so the trip is probably long overdue. \u201cFor the moon, we\u2019d like to return humans in the late 2020s,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re looking to take humans to Mars sometime in the 2030s.\u201d Before You Go LOADING ERROR LOADING Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

CNN Meteorologist Schools Trump On The Meaning Of The Word 'Climate' \"Climate isn\u2019t a day, climate is long-term,\" Chad Myers explains as he gives a global perspective. By Andy McDonald Writer, HuffPost Nov 23, 2018, 11:54 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING In a tweet Thursday, President Donald Trump tried to discredit global warming by pointing out how cold it was in the Northeast. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers was not impressed with Trump\u2019s assessment and had to set the president straight. \u201cThis is the coldest weather in the history of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC,\u201d Trump said Thursday afternoon, adding in a follow-up tweet three hours later, \u201cBrutal and extended cold blast could shatter ALL RECORDS \u2015 whatever happened to Global Warming?\u201d Advertisement This is the coldest weather in the history of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC, and one of the coldest Thanksgivings on record! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018 Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2018 Myers explained Thursday on CNN that just because there\u2019s a big cold bubble over one part of the country, that doesn\u2019t disprove climate change. Advertisement \u201cCompared to a normal day on record \u2014 and climate isn\u2019t a day, climate is long-term \u2014 but this is what the cold air mass looks like in the Northeast right now,\u201d Myers pointed out on the weather map, which showed a large blue mass across the Northeast and parts of Canada but higher-than-average temperatures everywhere else in the U.S. \u201cThe rest of the country is well above normal.\u201d Myers then zoomed out to show the temperatures for the rest of the world. \u201cFind a lot of blue on this map?\u201d Myers said, showing a world map covered mostly in red blotches. \u201cNo, not really.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

No, The Powerball Jackpot Isn't Enough To Give Everyone $4.3 Million Dividing up the winnings would give everyone less. A lot less. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jan 11, 2016, 09:44 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Unfortunately, this is not enough to solve poverty. Credit: Associated Press Memes might be good for a laugh... but don't count on them for math. A viral post from Instagram meme creator Esteyban that is now being widely shared on Facebook claims the $1.3 billion Powerball jackpot is enough to turn every American into an instant millionaire. \"Poverty solved!!\" the meme optimistically declares. A meme circulating on Instagram and Facebook claims the Powerball jackpot can end poverty. Credit: Esteyban Advertisement Just one problem: The numbers are a little bit off. Instead of giving everyone $4.33 million, as the post calculates, divvying up the jackpot among 300 million people would result in a payout of $4.33 each. If you use the actual population -- 322.8 million -- we'd get just $4.02 each, plus a fraction of a cent. Since $1.3 billion is the jackpot for those who choose to have it paid out over 30 years, that adds up to a hair over 13 cents per person per year. Since the meme was created, the jackpot jumped to $1.4 billion -- or enough to give everyone roughly an extra penny per year. Advertisement Don't spend it all in one place. Instagram user Esteyban has deleted the original post and owned up to the math mistake. \"Sometimes it takes a little humility and humor to start a conversation about an important topic,\" he wrote. The next Powerball drawing is on Wednesday night.

MIT Scientists Created A Plane That Flies With No Moving Parts The plane uses an ion drive to propel itself through the air -- in absolute silence. By Andy McDonald Writer, HuffPost Nov 26, 2018, 05:36 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Imagine a plane with no engine \u2015 with, in fact, no moving parts at all \u2015 not just gliding like a paper airplane, but being propelled through the air. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute Of Technology (MIT) have made it a reality using an ion drive. The project\u2019s lead researcher is Steven Barrett, a professor at MIT\u2019s department of aeronautics and astronautics. Barrett said he was inspired by the show \u201cStar Trek,\u201d in which spacecrafts travel rather silently and without the use of traditional fossil fuels. Advertisement The five-pound plane\u2019s ion drive consists of electrodes near the front with a positive 20,000-volt charge and air foils near the back with a negative 20,000-volt charge. The electrodes positively ionize the surrounding air molecules, which are then attracted to the negatively charged air foils, creating an accelerating ionic wind to propel the craft. And with no propellers, turbines or moving parts in general, all this is done in complete silence. Their most successful sustained fight so far was about 10 seconds, or a distance of 60 meters. Barrett says that while implementing this technology in commercial travel is a long way away , the soonest use might be in the advancement of drone technology. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA's Close Encounter With Mysterious Space Object Will Make History On New Year's Day The New Horizons probe is hurtling toward an object nicknamed Ultima Thule in the mostly unexplored Kuiper Belt. By Carol Kuruvilla Religion Reporter, HuffPost Dec 27, 2018, 05:57 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING As revelers on the East Coast celebrate the arrival of a new year, scientists will be crossing another kind of frontier \u2015 4 billion miles from the sun. Early on Jan. 1, NASA\u2019s New Horizons probe is scheduled to have a close encounter with the most distant planetary object that humans have ever studied. Advertisement The spacecraft, which zipped by Jupiter in 2007 and Pluto in 2015, is now making its way toward 2014 MU69 \u2015 a mysterious chunk of rock and ice in an almost entirely unexplored region of space. The object is nicknamed Ultima Thule \u2014 \u201cmost distant\u201d in Latin combined with the ancient Greeks\u2019 name for the world\u2019s northernmost place . The New Horizons mission team said the nickname refers to \u201c a place beyond the known world .\u201d Ultima Thule is roughly the size of New York City and orbits the sun once every 297 years , according to National Geographic . A rendering of the New Horizons probe and the celestial body it is rapidly approaching, Ultima Thule, provided by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. NASA/Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute Advertisement But it\u2019s Ultima Thule\u2019s location that makes it interesting to scientists. The object resides 1 billion miles beyond Pluto, in the Kuiper Belt . This region stretches around the sun and is home to millions of icy bodies. Scientists believe these bodies are leftovers from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago and have remained largely unchanged since then. \u201cIt\u2019s the oldest relic of the solar system we\u2019ve ever studied,\u201d New Horizons team member Marc Buie told National Geographic. Alan Stern, the NASA mission\u2019s principal investigator , said in a Facebook Live video that scientists aren\u2019t sure what to expect from Ultima Thule. \u201cWhen we fly past Ultima, we\u2019re going to have a chance to see the way things were back at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unknown and unexplored.\u201d New Horizons launched into space in January 2006. Four years ago, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to pinpoint Kuiper Belt objects within the spacecraft\u2019s reach and settled on Ultima Thule. Advertisement New Horizons is hurtling through space at 31,500 miles per hour (more than eight miles a second) to reach the object. As it passes Ultima Thule, it will take hundreds of photographs and other measurements to collect more information about the celestial body. The team hopes to map the object\u2019s surface, figure out its temperature and determine if it has an atmosphere, moons or rings. According to a schedule released by the New Horizons team , the spacecraft will fly by Ultima Thule at 12:33 a.m. Eastern time on Jan. 1 . It will travel within 2,200 miles of the body, less than one-third the distance of its closest approach to Pluto. An illustration of the New Horizons probe's path through space, provided by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. NASA/Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute Advertisement There\u2019s still some uncertainty, though; New Horizons\u2019 images could come back blurred if Ultima Thule is rotating rapidly, National Geographic reports. And there\u2019s also a chance that the spacecraft\u2019s camera could miss it completely. \u201cWe might get it, and we might not,\u201d Stern said on Facebook Live . \u201cAnd if we get it, it\u2019s going to be spectacular.\u201d The New Horizons team will be counting down to the spacecraft\u2019s closest approach to Ultima Thule early on New Year\u2019s Day. Some results from the encounter will be shared in the following days, but it will take the spacecraft until 2020 to send all the data from the encounter back to Earth.

Astronaut Will Return From A Year In Space Both Older <em>And</em> Younger Than His Twin Brother Astronaut Will Return From Space Both OlderYounger Than His Twin Brother By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 27, 2015, 01:34 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT BAIKONUR, KAZAKHSTAN - MARCH 26: Expedition 43 NASA Astronaut Scott Kelly, left, and his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, pose for a photograph Thursday, March 26, 2015 at the Cosmonaut Hotel in Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Scott Kelly, and Russian Cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko, and Gennady Padalka of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) are scheduled to launch to the International Space Station in the Soyuz TMA-16M spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan March 28, Kazakh time (March 27 Eastern time.) As the one-year crew, Kelly and Kornienko will return to Earth on Soyuz TMA-18M in March 2016. (Photo by Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images) Today NASA\u2019s Scott Kelly, along with two Russian cosmonauts, blasts off for the International Space Station (ISS), where they plan to spend 342 days. Kelly\u2019s identical twin brother Mark, also a (retired) astronaut, will stay on Earth to serve as the other half of an unprecedented experiment. Researchers at a host of universities and medical schools will be watching how Scott Kelly\u2019s weightless lifestyle affects him differently from his Earth-bound twin. They\u2019ll study whether it increases his risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), distorts his perception and reasoning, or alters his gut bacteria. Advertisement And among other things they\u2019ll look at whether cosmic rays\u2014radiation from deep space\u2014might shorten his lifespan by speeding up damage to his telomeres.

Why We Can't Stop Watching Disgusting Videos Why We Can't Stop Watching Disgusting Videos By Ryan Buxton Senior Editor, HuffPost Live Jul 25, 2015, 08:35 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT From disturbing sexual videos to clips of brutal ISIS beheadings, all sorts of disgusting content is available online -- and much of it goes viral. But why do we feel compelled to watch -- and share -- things that we know will upset us? On Thursday, HuffPost Live's Nancy Redd got the scoop from Bridget Rubenking. The University of Central Florida professor conducted a study that sought to learn more about disgust by measuring the physiological responses of 130 undergraduate students who had watched unsettling movie scenes. Advertisement What did the study show? The popularity of repugnant content may lie in the fact that it's hard to forget. In Rubenking's study, she explained, participants had a better memory of disgusting images and scenes that came after them than scenes they saw before the unnerving content. \"Disgust actually acted like a cognitive interrupt. You forgot what you saw before that because the disgusting stuff became the only salient thing in that message,\" Rubenking explained. Coupled with that is \"the urge and the need to tell someone else\" about what you've seen, said Know Your Meme editor Brad Kim, who appeared on the HuffPost Live segment along with Rubenking. Advertisement \"To borrow the words of the Internet axiom, 'What has been seen cannot be unseen. But what has not yet been seen but [is] discouraged to see, must be seen,'\" Kim said. \"This is kind of the underlying psychology that drives people to say, 'Oh yeah, I want to see and I want to know how disgusted I can get.'\" And there actually is a cognitive benefit to watching and sharing extreme content. \"Part of that can be explained by inherently being humans and wanting to learn from what is disgusting, so you don't become the disgusting dead body or you don't eat the wrong thing,\" Rubenking said. \"There is something very cool and social about disgust responses that we don't see in regards to all different types of memes.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Your Last Chance to Ask Candidates a Science Question Nothing impacts modern life more than science and yet the candidates are rarely asked questions about it and almost never mention it in speeches. This is a neglect of almost insane proportions. Even children know this. By Matthew Chapman, Contributor Director/Screenwriter/Author/Journalist Director/Screenwriter/Author/Journalist Apr 3, 2016, 04:58 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Scientist Holding Molecule Nothing impacts modern life more than science and yet the candidates are rarely asked questions about it and almost never mention it in speeches. This is a neglect of almost insane proportions. Even children know this. Only one organization has ever succeeded in getting American presidential candidates to lay out their basic science agendas in advance of the election. In 2008 and 2012, ScienceDebate.org persuaded Obama, McCain and Romney to answer 14 Top Science Questions in writing. When published online, their answers reached almost a billion people each time and for the first time in history American voters went to the polls knowing how their candidates felt about arguably the most important issues on earth. Advertisement Science Debate is now calling for final public input on a new set of questions for this election. If you have a science question you'd like the candidates to answer, now's the time. The chance to submit questions or vote on existing ones will end on April 12. As you'll see there's a fantastic alphabet of issues starting with BIODIVERSITY and BIOSECURITY, going through such things as MENTAL HEALTH and NUCLEAR ENERGY, and ending with VACCINATION and WATER. But you can ask any science question you want. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Having had a severely depressed mother, I want to know how candidate will encourage brain research so we can bring relief to those who suffer from various mental disorders. Like so many science questions, this one is not just about individual human pain, lost opportunities, lost lives, but also about the economy: mental illness costs America $300 billion a year.

Watch Astronauts' Violent Return To Earth From Inside Their Space Capsule The three-hour trip from the ISS is loud and surprisingly bumpy. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Sep 2, 2015, 04:44 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT If you think riding a rocket to the International Space Station makes for a bumpy ride, check out this new video showing what it's like to return to Earth after the mission is over. The video, just published by io9 , follows three astronauts from the moment their Soyuz capsule undocks from the ISS to what is considered a \"soft\" landing on solid ground in Kazakhstan. Although the capsule hits the ground at a speed of about 3 miles an hour, the term \"soft\" might not be the most accurate description... Advertisement \"The soft landing is not really soft ... it felt like a head-on collision between a truck and a small car, and of course, I was in the small car,\" former astronaut Paolo Nespoli said in a training video released by the European Space Agency in 2013. The three-hour descent that leads up to the landing aren't especially tranquil either. They're filled with a cacophony of sounds as portions of the capsule's exterior are stripped away by the rush of hot gases outside. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Are Obese People Wired To Crave High-Calorie Foods? A new study finds food addiction may be hard-wired into the brain. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Sep 2, 2015, 02:56 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists and doctors have long debated whether \"food addiction\" is real and whether it plays a role in obesity. A new brain imaging study offers intriguing evidence that suggests obese people are hard-wired to crave sugary and fatty foods. A team of international scientists, who presented their findings at a neuroscience conference in Amsterdam earlier this week, has discovered that food cravings can lead to brain and behavioral changes in obese people similar to those seen in drug addicts. \" What we do know is that both food and drugs can cause behaviors that are very similar to addiction, such as the inability to cut down, continued use despite negative consequences, and a sense of a loss of control,\" Dr. Oren Contreras-Rodriguez, a researcher at the University of Granada in Spain and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post in an email. Advertisement \"Comparing food addiction with drug addiction is controversial -- d rug use changes the way the brain functions, and this is not still clear in obesity,\" Contreras-Rodriguez added. But the study did show that food cravings seem to activate the brain's reward system differently in obese people compared to individuals of a healthy weight. For the study, 39 obese people and 42 healthy-weight people were given a buffet-style meal. A few hours later, their brains were scanned while they viewed photos of high-calorie foods from the buffet, which was meant to stimulate cravings. Advertisement What did the brain scans reveal? The brains of the healthy-weight people showed increased connectivity between areas involved in flavor evaluation and areas involved in emotion and reward-motivated decision-making. This means that the people were more likely to consider how good the food tastes, as well as other factors -- like nutrition value and hunger level -- when determining whether or not they wanted to eat it. That resulted in fewer cravings. The brain imaging of the obese people, on the other hand, showed they associated high-calorie foods (read: sugar and fat) with the promise of reward. Researchers pointed to the increased connectivity between two other areas of the brain -- one that processes reward-motivated behaviors, called the dorsal caudate, and another that assesses food\u2019s energetic value, called the somatosensory cortex. Advertisement The association of these two brain networks can make it more difficult for obese people to turn down unhealthy foods, Contreras-Rodriguez said. When the researchers measured the participants' body mass index three months later, they found that the weight gain in the obese people correlated with the level of connectivity between the dorsal caudate and somatosensory cortex. In other words, cravings seemed to predict weight gain. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Working Out 4 Hours After Studying May Help Your Brain Remember Stuff The newest memory trick comes from the gym. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jun 16, 2016, 05:02 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Here\u2019s your new study routine: Hit the books. Wait a little while. Then, hit the gym. New research suggests that physical exercise can help people retain information if it happens at the right time -- namely, a few hours after you learn the info, when new memories are getting stabilized in your brain. The study's authors, who include researchers from Scotland's University of Edinburgh and the Netherlands' Radboud University, divided 72 people into groups and then had them all complete a memory task. Immediately afterward, one group of participants were asked to exercise on spinning bikes for half an hour. Another group were asked to wait four hours and then exercise. A third group weren't asked to exercise at all. Two days later, the participants returned to the lab for a follow-up memory test. The people who'd waited four hours and then exercised performed about 10 percent better on this new test than people in the other groups. Advertisement The boost in memory was modest, but the findings offer initial evidence that properly timed physical exercise can improve memory retention, the researchers say. The exact time window for optimal results is not yet known. Although the study tested the effects of exercising after a four-hour delay, it's possible that waiting two hours or six hours to exercise could have a better (or worse) effect on memory. Newly learned information creates memory traces in the brain, which can either decay or get consolidated into long-term memory. Recent studies have shown that physical exercise causes a sharp increase in the release of certain neurotransmitters, like dopamine and noradrenaline, that are likely crucial to the consolidation of memories. The researchers speculate this may be the reason why exercising helped the people in their study to retain information. \"These proteins help stabilizing new memory traces, which would otherwise be lost,\" Dr. Guillen Fernandez, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Radboud University Medical Center, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Physical exercise is at the start of this sequence, because it is accompanied by the release of dopamine and norepinephrine.\" Advertisement Fernandez said that high-intensity exercise is \"likely necessary\" to produce the memory-improving effects, and that \"further studies are necessary to define the optimal delay in humans.\" In other words, it's possible that four hours is not the ideal amount of time to wait. Future research may help us zero in on a more precise answer. The research appeared Thursday at the journal Current Biology.

LEAVE A COMMENT \"Who is that pooch I see, staring straight back at me?\" Marc Piscotty / Reuters By Ed Yong In 1970, a psychologist named Gordon Gallup Jr. anesthetized four chimpanzees and applied red dye to their eyebrows. When the chimps came around, they caught sight of their reflections in a mirror that had been placed in their enclosure. And they did what you or I might do in those circumstances \u2014 they touched their eyebrows, prodding at the marks. Gallup concluded that chimps could recognize their own reflections \u2014 a feat that \u201cwould seem to require a rather advanced form of intellect\u201d and that \u201cimplies a concept of self.\u201d Thus was born the mirror test \u2014 one of the most famous techniques in the study of animal intelligence, and one of the most controversial. The test has been administered to dozens of species, and usually takes roughly the same form. An animal is marked on a part of its body that it can\u2019t usually see, and given access to a mirror. If it inspects the mark on its body, and not on the reflection, and if it interacts with that area more often than usual, then it passes the test. Advertisement Chimps and orangutans have consistently passed, as have some bottlenose dolphins, Asian elephants and European magpies. That seems like a list of animal intelligentsia, but other clever creatures have largely or completely failed the test, including crows, parrots, gorillas, monkeys, dogs and even some young children. As I wrote earlier this year , these failures say very little about whether these individuals have a sense of self, and a lot about whether the mirror test is actually appropriate for them. RELATED: A New Origin Story for Dogs Consider the dogs. Dogs don\u2019t groom each other to the same extent that apes do, so there\u2019s no reason to expect that they would try to examine a mark on their heads. What\u2019s more, the mirror test is a visual test, designed by visual animals (us) for other visual animals. Dogs see just fine, but they mainly live in a world of smell . If you want to know if they have a concept of self, it makes little sense to confront them with a mirror. You need to work in their world. A world of chemicals drifting through the air. A world that\u2019s hard for us to imagine. \u201cDogs see just fine, but they mainly live in a world of smell.\u201d Advertisement \u201cSmell is so distant to our experience,\u201d says Alexandra Horowitz from Barnard College. \u201cWe\u2019re just not engaged with olfaction, so it\u2019s taken a long time to see \u2014 or even imagine \u2014 what the world might be like for non-visual creatures, and to design experiments with that in mind.\u201d Marc Bekoff from the University of Colorado, Boulder, did just that with his own dog Jethro. Over five winters, he would scoop up snow that Jethro and other dogs had peed upon, and move it to new locations. \u201cFor some reasons passers-by thought I was strange and generally left me alone,\u201d Bekoff later wrote . He found that Jethro spent less time sniffing his own urine than that of other dogs. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize himself in a mirror, but he could recognize his own distinct odor. RELATED: Dogs\u2019 Love Isn\u2019t Unconditional After All Inspired by this \u201cyellow snow experiment,\u201d Horowitz (who once studied with Bekoff) designed a bigger and more thorough study . She recruited 36 New York dog owners and presented their pooches with two canisters. In one, she put a tiny drop of each dog\u2019s own urine. In the other, she put the same urine along with a different scent \u2014 the equivalent of marking an animal\u2019s head with red dye. Advertisement The dogs spent more time sniffing the canister with the modified odor than the one with their unadulterated urine. The presence of the extra scent changed how they behaved toward their own smell, just as the presence of a red mark changes how a chimp behaves toward its image in a mirror. Does this mean that they\u2019re recognizing their own olfactory \u201creflection\u201d? Not quite. Horowitz also gave the animals a choice between their adulterated urine, and the adulterating smell on its own. And this time, they sniffed both canisters just as often. This suggests that the dogs were drawn to the modified urine not because it contradicted some sense of self, but simply because it was unfamiliar. Dogs, after all, are drawn to new things. RELATED: What Is Jogging Doing to Your Dog? After seeing these results, Horowitz wondered if she had made her life more difficult than necessary, by choosing a scent that was too powerful. She had adulterated the dogs\u2019 urine with an extract of cancerous tissue, taken from a dog at a nearby veterinary school. Perhaps that was just too interesting a scent. Advertisement To control for this possibility, Horowitz repeated her experiment with 12 new dogs. This time, she altered their urine with a more neutral odor \u2014 anise essential oil. Once again, they spent more time sniffing their urine when it had been modified. But this time, they also sniffed that modified urine more than a sample of anise oil on its own. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nice analogy to the chimpanzee seeing a red mark on her forehead,\u201d Horowitz says. \u201cSeeing a red mark isn\u2019t intrinsically interesting. It\u2019s only interesting when it\u2019s situated on oneself.\u201d Admittedly, the crucial second study is a third the size of the first. But mirror-test experiments with other animals have often relied on sample sizes that are even smaller. And Horowitz adds that the dogs reacted to the scents at a speed that\u2019s rarely seen in mirror studies. \u201cGallup\u2019s chimps had ad-lib access to the mirror, and he was looking at behavior over many hours,\u201d she says. \u201cThese dogs had limited time to investigate [the canisters] and yet we got this result. I\u2019d assume that if we gave them that ad-lib exposure, we\u2019d see a lot more exploratory behaviour of the modified scent.\u201d \u201cThis research demonstrates that the way we ask about animal cognition can be just as important as the questions asked,\u201d says Monqiue Udell from Oregon State University, who also studies dog intelligence. \u201cIn some cases, asking a dog to complete a task designed for chimpanzees may be like asking a native English speaker to complete an intelligence test in a foreign language they have never studied.\u201d Advertisement Does this mean that dogs have a sense of self? Or a theory of mind \u2014 an ability to understand the mental states of others as distinct from one\u2019s own? Such questions may be too simplistic. \u201cI think that all of these abilities, which we mostly decline to see in nonhuman animals until they\u2019ve passed our tests, are defined in a far too binary way,\u201d Horowitz says. \u201cWhat we usually see is that an animal\u2019s performance lies somewhere along a spectrum of skill, and dogs are not at the zero part of that spectrum,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019d say that they have a rudimentary theory of mind \u2014 one that\u2019s not equivalent to a human adult, but that isn\u2019t an absence of thinking about one\u2019s self and others. They have, as we would suspect, some understanding of self, and some recognition of who they are as distinct from others.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Farming May Have Started Way Earlier Than Scientists Thought Researchers have found evidence of plant cultivation at a 23,000-year-old site. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 25, 2015, 08:53 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Amit Dave / Reuters When did humans first begin farming? Scientists have long thought that our prehistoric ancestors didn't start raising crops until some 12,000 years ago . But a new study suggests that the age of agriculture might have dawned much earlier . \"From what our current research reveals, the first indication for the earliest cultivation is 23,000 years ago on the shores of the Sea of Galilee in Israel,\" Dr. Ehud Weiss, professor of palaeoethnobotany at Bar-Ilan University in Israel and the lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"This is one of the most amazing finds a researcher can dream on. No one had previously imagined humans had started cultivating in such an early date.\" Advertisement For the study, the researchers analyzed a 23,000-year-old hunter-gatherer campsite , which was discovered in 1989 at the archaeological site Ohalo II near the Sea of Galilee. They examined about 150,000 plant specimens at the site and noticed evidence not only of domestic-type wheat and barley, but also of weeds known to flourish in the fields of domesticated crops. \"The plant remains from the site were unusually well-preserved because of being charred and then covered by sediment and water which sealed them in low-oxygen conditions,\" Weiss said in a written statement. \"Due to this, it was possible to recover an extensive amount of information on the site and its inhabitants.\" The site also yielded flint tools that might have been used for harvesting cereal plants. Given the findings, the researchers concluded that the campsite is probably the earliest known example of small-scale farming. Advertisement \"While full-scale agriculture did not develop until much later, our study shows that trial cultivation began far earlier than previously believed, and gives us reason to rethink our ancestors' capabilities ,\" Dr. Marcelo Sternberg, an ecologist at Tel Aviv University and a co-author of the study, said in a separate statement. \"Those early ancestors were more clever and more skilled than we knew.\" The study was published online in the journal Plos One on July 22.

Trust Us, You Don't Want To Be Caught In A Bat Tornado Eek! By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Feb 24, 2016, 03:29 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT You couldn't get us within 100 miles of this place, but we'll gladly watch 20 million bats in a feeding frenzy from the safety of our computer screen. As for Kelly Sweet, the National Geographic producer who gets caught in a bat tornado in the video above, hats off to her. However, we recommend she keep her hat on. \"You could not safely stand there because they will fly into you and get stuck in your hair,\" she says in the YouTube description. Advertisement The clip, posted earlier this month, features a guano-load of Mexican free-tailed bats, also known as Tadarida brasiliensis, flying out of Bracken Cave near San Antonio, Texas. It's home to the largest bat colony in the world, National Geographic says, and it hosts one heckuva buffet outside. On this hunt, which happens nightly between March and October before the bats migrate south, they consumed 200 tons of insects, the video says. Each bat can consume three times its body weight, according to Untamed Science. This isn't some fleeting all-you-can-eat. Mexican free-tailed bats can live up to 18 years to enjoy the bug cuisine, according to an Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum fact sheet. Advertisement Bon appetit!

Posted by Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden on Friday, January 8, 2016 The cute ball of fluff weighed just 1.6 ounces, according to the zoo's official Facebook page. Staff asked its Facebook fans to name the new arrival and they opted for either \"Bowie\" or \"Elvis.\" The King of Rock 'N' Roll was also born on Jan. 8. Since the zoo already had a king penguin named \"Elvis,\" \"Bowie\" was selected instead. The penguin is the zoo's first newborn of 2016. It joins 32 other \"little penguins\" in the largest colony in the U.S., according to the Daily Telegraph. Advertisement Little penguins are so-called because they are the smallest species of the bird , according to Penguins-World.com. They grow to an average of 13 inches tall and are found on the coastlines of southern Australia, New Zealand and occasionally Chile. They get their \"blue penguin\" nickname from their slate-blue plumage, which appears as their wing feathers grow large enough for flight . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Dog Germs May Be Good For Us, And Here's Why Doggie Germs May Be Good For Us, And Here's Why By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 24, 2015, 08:38 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The dog breed is a Hungarian Vizsla. Owning a dog may give your health an even bigger boost than we realized. Studies have linked dog ownership with reduced stress and anxiety as well as lower blood pressure . And now scientists believe that dogs may help pump up your immune system. Allergy-busters? Researchers from the University of Arizona are launching a new study to see if bacteria found on pet dogs encourage the growth of beneficial microorganisms in humans -- enough to lessen the sneezing, itching, and hives of an allergic reaction . Advertisement The study will analyze blood and skin samples of humans and their furry friends over a three-month period to track health changes , NPR reported. \"We've co-evolved with dogs over the millennia, but nobody really understands what it is about this dog-human relationship that makes us feel good about being around dogs ,\" Kim Kelly, an anthropology doctoral student who is participating in the new research, said in a written statement. \"Is it just that they're fuzzy and we like to pet them, or is there something else going on under the skin? The question really is: Has the relationship between dogs and humans gotten under the skin? And we believe it has.\" Sharing germs. Previous studies show that, indeed, dogs share much of their bacteria with their human owners over time, and households with pet dogs have greater bacterial diversity -- don't worry, exposure to a variety of microbes seems to build a stronger immune system. Advertisement \"We think dogs might work as probiotics to enhance the health of the bacteria that live in our guts. These bacteria, or 'microbiota,' are increasingly recognized as playing an essential role in our mental and physical health, especially as we age,\" Dr. Charles Raison, professor of psychiatry at the university and the principal investigator for the study, said in the statement. The researchers are currently raising funds for the study and recruiting volunteers between the ages of 50 and 80 to participate. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What To Do If You Find A Baby Songbird Out Of Its Nest Rosemary Mosco's handy flow chart has the answers. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Apr 4, 2016, 10:37 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Spring has sprung, and with it comes the hatching of adorable baby songbirds. But what should you do if you spot a tiny fluffy chick that's fallen from its nest? Leave it there; or take it your local veterinarian surgery? Luckily, Rosemary Mosco has produced this handy flow chart to answer any questions you may have: Birdandmoon.com/Rosemary Mosco The New England-based science and nature cartoonist's beautifully functional diagram is going viral, and can be downloaded from her own BirdandMoon.com website . Advertisement It begins by asking whether the bird is visibly injured or attacked by a cat. By answering \"yes,\" you're urged to contact a wildlife care center or rehabilitator. Responding \"no\" throws up a whole series of other questions, with outcomes ranging from returning the bird to its nest to not intervening at all. In a humorous aside, Mosco also asks whether the bird has \"many sharp teeth\" and a \"large claw on the second toe,\" which may indicate you actually have a dinosaur on your hands. Her advice? Run or just back off slowly. Hopefully it won't notice. Advertisement Mosco, who has an M.S. degree from the Field Naturalist Program at the University of Vermont, has worked with the National Park Service and other organizations to \" present science in accessible, fun ways ,\" according to her website. Here's her amusing take on global warming protests, which she posted on Twitter on Sunday: New comic: climate change protest. https://t.co/oQ5UUC4qFc pic.twitter.com/vbpgq0T4UL \u2014 Bird and Moon (@RosemaryMosco) April 3, 2016 Before You Go LOADING ERROR LOADING Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs Though both dark matter and dinosaurs are independently fascinating, you might reasonably assume that this unseen physical substance and this popular biological icon are entirely unrelated. And this might well be the case. But the Universe is by definition a single entity and in principle its components interact. By Lisa Randall, Contributor Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, 'Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe' Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, 'Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe' Oct 31, 2015, 04:25 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. illustration of a comet flying... The following is an excerpt from Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs by Lisa Randall. Excerpted by permission of Ecco, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. \"Dark matter\" and \"dinosaurs\" are words you rarely hear together except perhaps in the playground, a fantasy gaming club or some not-yet-released Spielberg movie. Dark matter is the elusive stuff in the Universe that interacts through gravity like ordinary matter, but that doesn't emit or absorb light. Astronomers detect its gravitational influence, but they literally don't see it. Dinosaurs, on the other hand... I doubt I need to explain dinosaurs. They were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates from 231 to 66 million years ago. Advertisement Though both dark matter and dinosaurs are independently fascinating, you might reasonably assume that this unseen physical substance and this popular biological icon are entirely unrelated. And this might well be the case. But the Universe is by definition a single entity and in principle its components interact. This book explores a speculative scenario in which my collaborators and I suggest that dark matter might ultimately (and indirectly) have been responsible for the extinction of the dinosaur. Paleontologists, geologists and physicists have shown that 66 million years ago, an object at least ten kilometers wide plummeted to Earth from space and destroyed the terrestrial dinosaurs, along with three-quarters of the other species on the planet. The object might have been a comet from the outer reaches of the Solar System, but no one knows why this comet was perturbed from its weakly bound, but stable, orbit. Our proposal is that during the Sun's passage through the midplane of the Milky Way -- the stripe of stars and bright dust that you can observe in a clear night sky -- the Solar System encountered a disk of dark matter that dislodged the distant object, thereby precipitating this cataclysmic impact. In our galactic vicinity, the bulk of the dark matter surrounds us in an enormous smooth and diffuse spherical halo. Advertisement I'll tell you right up front that I don't yet know if this idea is correct. It's only an unexpected type of dark matter that would yield measurable influences on living beings (well, technically no longer living). This book is the story of our unconventional proposal about just such surprisingly influential dark matter. But these speculative ideas -- as provocative as they might be -- are not this book's primary focus. At least as important to its content as the story of the dinosaur-destroying comet are the context and the science that embrace it, which include the far better established frameworks of cosmology and the science of the Solar System. I feel very fortunate that the topics I study frequently guide my research toward big questions such as what stuff is made of, the nature of space and time, and how everything in the Universe evolved to the world we see today. In this book, I hope to share a lot of this too. In the research that I will describe, my studies led me down a path where I started thinking more broadly about cosmology, astrophysics, geology, and even biology. The focus was still on fundamental physics. But having done more conventional particle physics all my life -- the study of the building blocks of familiar matter such as the paper or screen on which you're reading this -- I've found it refreshing to probe into what is known -- and what soon will be known -- about the dark world too, as well as the implications of basic physical processes for the Solar System and for the Earth. Advertisement Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs explains our current knowledge about the Universe, the Milky Way, the Solar System, as well as what makes for a habitable zone and life on Earth. I'll discuss dark matter and the cosmos, but I will also delve into comets, asteroids and the emergence and extinction of life, with special focus on the object hat fell to Earth to kill off the terrestrial dinosaurs -- and a lot of the rest of life here. I wanted this book to convey the many incredible connections that got us here so we can more meaningfully understand what is happening now. When we think about our planet today, we might also want to better understand the context in which it developed. When I started concentrating on the concepts underlying the ideas in this book, I was awe-struck and enchanted not only by our current knowledge of our environment -- local, solar, galactic and universal -- but also by how much we ultimately hope to understand, from our random tiny perch here on Earth. I also was overwhelmed by the many connections among the phenomena that ultimately allow us to exist. To be clear, mine is not a religious viewpoint. I don't feel the need to assign a purpose or meaning. Yet I can't help but feel the emotions we tend to call religious as we come to understand the immensity of the universe, our past, and how it all fits together. It offers anyone some perspective when dealing with the foolishness of everyday life. This newer research actually has made me look differently at the world and the many pieces of the Universe that created the Earth -- and us. Growing up in Queens I saw the impressive buildings of New York City, but not so much of nature. What little nature I did see was cultivated into parks or lawns -- retaining little of the form it took before humans arrived. Yet when you walk on a beach, you are walking on ground up creatures -- or at least their protective coverings. The limestone cliffs you might see on a beach or in the countryside are composed of previously living creatures too, from millions of years in the past. Mountains arose from tectonic plates that collided, and the molten magma that drives these movements is the result of radioactive material buried near the core of the Earth. Advertisement Our energy came from the Sun's nuclear processes -- though it has been transformed and stored in different ways since those initial nuclear reactions occurred. Many of the resources we use are heavier elements that came from outer space, which were deposited on the Earth's surface by asteroids or comets. Some amino acids were deposited by meteoroids too -- perhaps bringing life -- or the seeds of life -- to Earth. And before any of this happened, dark matter collapsed into clumps whose gravity attracted more matter -- which eventually turned into galaxies, galaxy clusters, and stars like our Sun. Ordinary matter -- important as it is to us -- does not tell the whole story. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Stars and nebulae are further evidence that we exist in a galaxy that resides within a far larger Universe. We orbit within a Solar System where the seasons remind us further of our orientation and placement within it.

Arnold of the U.S., George P. Smith of the U.S., and Gregory P. Winter of Britain, during the announcement at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, on Oct. 3. AP STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Three researchers who \u201charnessed the power of evolution\u201d to produce enzymes and antibodies that have led to new drugs and biofuels have been named winners of the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.01 million) prize goes to Frances Arnold of the California Institute of Technology. The other half is shared by George Smith of the University of Missouri and Gregory Winter of the MRC molecular biology lab in Cambridge, England. Advertisement The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which chose the winners on Wednesday, said Arnold conducted the first directed evolution of enzymes, whose uses include \u201cmore environmentally friendly manufacturing of chemical substances such as pharmaceuticals and the production of renewable fuels.\u201d Smith developed a method to evolve new proteins and Winter used the method to evolve antibodies, which are disease-fighting proteins in the blood. The first pharmaceutical based on Winter\u2019s work was approved for use in 2002 and is employed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases, the academy said.

Watch This Corpse Flower Bloom Or Else Wait Another 5 Years Stinky Phil attracts crowds that want to get a whiff. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Sep 1, 2015, 12:56 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This is one popular attraction for something that totally reeks. Stinky Phil, a corpse flower that blooms once every five years, drew more than 1,000 sniff-seeking flower fans over the weekend to its greenhouse at the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The college released time-lapse footage recorded over 36 hours of the rare blooming. Before the weekend, Virginia Tech News described the expected odor as a \"primordial stench akin to rotting flesh.\" The giant flower, native to Sumatra, Indonesia, can reach 7 to 12 feet high, with a diameter of 3 to 4 feet. Advertisement Corpse flowers are known to draw large crowds. Spike, a titan arum plant in Glencoe, Illinois, recently attracted 50,000 people around the time it was expected to bloom. Unfortunately, Spike failed to open without some help from scientists and did not release the terrible odor fans were hoping for, The Chicago Tribune reported .

Modern Humans May Have Caused The Extinction Of Real 'Hobbits' Watch how scientists use 3D imaging to examine when -- and why -- this ancient hominin species became extinct. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Apr 2, 2016, 09:52 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A reconstruction sculpture of a \"hobbit\" head. The species, Homo floresiensis, is an extinct human relative from the Liang Bua cave on Indonesia's Flores Island. Smithsonian Digitization Program Office Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, a mysterious human \"hobbit\" species once thrived. They sustained themselves off fauna, and even slew dragons -- well, Komodos . It sounds like a science fiction novel, but these diminutive beings actually lived in Indonesia . They possibly even interacted with modern humans, according to researchers, who spent nearly a decade conducting lengthy excavations at Liang Bua cave to uncover evidence of the \"hobbits\" of Flores Island , whose scientific name is Homo floresiensis . Advertisement The new research, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, readjusts the timeline of when \"hobbits\" died out as a species -- pushing the date back from as recently as 12,000 years ago to a more likely 50,000 years ago. If true, that would mean H. floresiensis might have had contact with modern humans, who would have traveled through the Indonesian islands en route to Australia. \"We don't know for sure, because we don't have evidence of them on the island before 11,000 years ago,\" Research co-author Dr. Matthew Tocheri, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution \u2019s National Museum of Natural History, told The Huffington Post. \"We know that modern humans reached Australia about 50,000 years ago, and you can't get there unless you go across these Indonesian islands,\" he said. Advertisement \"Up until now, this has been a persistent issue in archaeology in this region. We're just missing the evidence that we haven't discovered the sites that show exactly how modern humans navigated these islands to ultimately reach Australia, and Flores is one of them.\" A University of New England image of a hobbit skull shows how much smaller it was compared to a human skull. Peter Brown/University of New England/PA Archive The recent research involved a new analysis of old fossilized \"hobbit\" bones that were previously unearthed in the Liang Bua cave. Advertisement Based on new-found stratigraphic and chronological evidence, the researchers concluded that those skeletal remains may be between 100,000 and 60 ,000 years old. The researchers noted that whether H. floresiensis survived after 50,000 years ago is an \"open question.\" Looking remarkably like a Hollywood set design, this is the impressive Liang Bua cave in Flores Island, Indonesia. Liang Bua Team - Smithsonian Advertisement \"We dated charcoal, sediments, flowstones, volcanic ash and even the H. floresiensis bones themselves using the most up-to-date scientific methods available,\" said research co-author Dr. Richard Roberts, a professor at the University of Wollongong in Australia in a statement . \"In the last decade, we\u2019ve vastly improved our understanding of when the deposits accumulated in Liang Bua, and what this means for the age of \u2018hobbit\u2019 bones and stone tools,\" he added. \"But whether \u2018hobbits\u2019 encountered modern humans or other groups of humans -- such as the \u2018 Denisovans \u2019 -- dispersing through Southeast Asia remains an open and intriguing question.\" For now, the researchers are hoping to gather more insight into the secret lives of the \"hobbits\" by using 3D imaging in the Liang Bua cave to map out the entire excavation site. (Learn more in the video below.) Advertisement Archaeologists first discovered H. floresiensis in 2003 , when they found fossilized skeletal remains of the species buried roughly 20 feet down in the Liang Bua cave. The research team that made this discovery nicknamed the small skeleton the \"hobbit,\" according to Tocheri. \"They were getting ready to publish in Nature and Mike Morwood, the lead archaeologist, started referring to it as the 'hobbit,' just amongst themselves because it was so small and so odd,\" Tocheri said. \"At the same time, it was when ' The Lord of the Rings ' movies were really big, especially in Australia and New Zealand. When the initial paper was first published, and they were doing a press conference, it just slipped out -- and it touched a nerve and caught on.\" Advertisement A skull and limb bones indicated that a fully grown adult H. floresiensis would have stood about 3.5 feet tall, and likely had an extremely small brain. \"We still know very little. In terms of their overall bodies, their brains are very small, essentially the same size as living chimpanzees,\" Tocheri said. \"Over a third smaller than modern humans, but there seems to be parts of the brain that, even though it's so small, suggests that it was more reorganized. There's a debate over how much large brain size relates to intelligence.\" The University of Wollongong's Dr. Richard Roberts and Dr. Thomas Sutikna, holding a copy of a Homo floresiensis skull. Sutikna oversaw the excavations on the Island of Flores. University of Wollongong Advertisement Tocheri told HuffPost that this ongoing research is somewhat frustrating because the \"hobbit\" fossils tend to resemble those of earlier species in the human family tree that date back to 1-3 million years ago. Nonetheless, finding H. floresiensis fossils in Indonesia sediments dating back to around 50,000 years ago suggests that there was an entire lineage of hominins that scientists may have essentially missed, from Africa, across Asia to the Indonesian island of Flores. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Is The Great Barrier Reef Like You've Never Seen It Before David Attenborough uses new technologies to create an interactive journey, highlighting the perils of climate change. By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Jan 12, 2016, 06:14 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Sir David Attenborough is the indisputable king of nature documentaries. He's best known for narrating \"Planet Earth,\" the BBC series, but over his 65-year career, the naturalist-turned-broadcaster has fundamentally changed the way humans see the natural world. He's even had animals named after him . Now, Attenborough, 89, wants to give viewers a deeper, more interactive look into an environment that is on the brink of extinction . Attenborough's \" The Great Barrier Reef: An Interactive Journey \" is an online expedition packed with virtual reality, interactive games, time lapses and short films that take you into one of the world's most prized reefs, its habitants and its climate change-induced decay. Advertisement The multi-media website, which debuted in late December , has the same awe-inspiring visuals blended with fascinating and sobering facts typical of an Attenborough documentary -- only this time, viewers can guide their own expedition through the world's largest, most diverse stretch of coral reef . And they can do much more than just watch. An interactive timeline, for example, lets viewers speed up time to see how acidification affects a sand dollar. Or you can see through the eyes of a mantis shrimp and its 16 light-detecting cells (humans have only three). Advertisement Another feature, as seen in the virtual reality video below, gives users a heartbreaking 360-degree look at how a particular coral reef bleached completely over the course of a single year. Corals that experience mass bleaching like this can take decades to recover . The website, which provides near-real time snapshots of global weather patterns , will be regularly updated by leading coral experts for the next five years , The Guardian reported. Advertisement \"With this ability,\" the website explains, \"we can compare today's conditions to those of the past and see high temperatures and severe weather events becoming the norm.\" The interactive website was made in conjunction with the new BBC documentary series, \" The Great Barrier Reef with David Attenborough .\" Advertisement During filming, Attenborough and his crew descended a record-breaking 1,000 feet to the ocean floor in a submarine. What they captured, while stunning, revealed the perilous future the Great Barrier Reef faces if climate change continues. \"It's a very serious threat that the reef is facing,\" Attenborough said, according to News Corp Australia. \"The issue is, in fact, the changes of the ocean and the speed at which the planet is changing. ... It's real now, but it will be imminent unless we manage to control the warming of the planet within two degrees.\" Attenborough said he hopes his online expedition will raise awareness among a wider audience. \" New mediums, all used at once, give different platforms for kids who will never watch the TV series ,\" Attenborough told The Guardian. Advertisement \"Technology enables you to go beyond the human faculties,\" he added. \"Nobody, nobody at all, has been able to have such insight as completely as we have today.\" Experience the Great Barrier Reef and its uncertain future here.

How Becoming An Expert Can Make You Closed-Minded Beware of this major downside to acquiring expertise. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Oct 31, 2015, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Todor Tsvetkov via Getty Images What are you an expert in? Whether it's politics, chemistry or playing an instrument, a new study finds there's one major downside to having in-depth knowledge of a certain subject. Research from Loyola University of Chicago suggests that being an expert can make you more closed-minded -- and therefore less creative -- in your thinking. The study found that people who perceive themselves to be experts tend to be less open to new ideas and alternative viewpoints. Advertisement The findings illustrate what's known as the \"earned dogmatism\" effect -- the tendency to think in a more closed-minded, or dogmatic, way when we consider ourselves to be an expert. \"For example, if an individual is told that they performed really well on a test of their political knowledge, they temporarily become more dogmatic in their approach to politics,\" Dr. Victor Otatti, a professor of psychology at the university and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"When individuals perceive themselves to be an expert, they feel that they have 'earned' the privilege of thinking and behaving in a more dogmatic manner.\" In a series of experiments, Ottati and his colleagues manipulated participants into feeling either like experts or novices in a given area (for instance, politics) by asking them either very easy or very difficult questions about that topic. Advertisement Then, the researchers used various methods of testing the participants' thinking styles by asking them to agree or disagree with statements such as \"I am open to considering other political viewpoints.\" They found that the participants who were made to feel like experts were more likely to exhibit a closed-minded thinking style. The researchers concluded that when we take on the role of an \"expert,\" we tend to think and act in a way that we feel is consistent with the social expectations of that role. Advertisement \"In our society, we tolerate more forceful and dogmatic expressions of opinion when the speaker is an expert than when the speaker is a novice,\" Ottati said. \"So, when the situation makes us feel like we are an 'expert,' it activates these role expectations in our mind, and we feel more entitled to think in a dogmatic manner -- in other words, we feel more entitled to dismiss, ignore, or disparage opinions and viewpoints that differ from our own opinion.\" The findings suggest that the best way to be an expert is to work towards achieving mastery while reminding ourselves of how much we still don't know. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Turns Out Boa Constrictors Might Not Actually Suffocate Their Prey The prey dies from a loss of circulation, new research suggests. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 23, 2015, 10:55 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Les Regards de Gwaldel/500px If you have recurring nightmares about being eaten by a boa constrictor, you may have to slightly alter the details. Boa constrictors, known for tightly wrapping their bodies around their prey, have long been thought to kill the animals via suffocation. New research from Dickinson College , however, suggests that death may actually be occurring because the snakes are cutting off the blood supply to their prey\u2019s vital organs. Advertisement When a boa constrictor kills its prey, \u201cit looks like the [prey] animals are gasping for air,\u201d Scott Boback, who led the study, said in a news release. However, back in 1994, Boback\u2019s colleague Dave Hardy noticed that it appears the animals were dying much more quickly than one would expect if they were suffocating. \u201cHe suspected that it was circulatory or cardiac arrest because of the speed at which death was occurring,\u201d Boback said. New research by Boback and his team, published Wednesday in The Journal Of Experimental Biology , appears to back that theory up. The scientists monitored the blood pressure of rats being squeezed by the constrictors, and found that after the snake took hold, the rodent\u2019s circulation totally shut down in only a few seconds. Advertisement The study suggests that death occurs after the rat passes out from a loss of blood to the brain and the rodent\u2019s critical organs fail. Boback noted in the press release that the rats were anesthetized before the experiments. \u201cIt was not something that we took lightly and we wanted to make sure that the animals did not experience pain or suffer,\u201d he said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Partial Eclipse Of The Heart Partial Eclipse Of The Heart By David L.

LEAVE A COMMENT One of my daughters made the trip to North Carolina to see the eclipse in the \u201ctotality\u201d zone. I\u2019m a little jealous- but mostly just happy that she had the chance to do it. My wife and I, and those of our kids at home for the moment, saw only a partial eclipse here in Connecticut. Despite that, and the pesky clouds, it was pretty spectacular. All the more so for knowing this is really just the trivial consequence of the smallest of cosmic gears, turning in our inconsequential solar yard- yet still enough to rivet the attention of an entire nation of people, if not this little world. Advertisement After viewing the eclipse and capturing a few images like the one above, I gave in immediately, and sadly, to the sudden insistence of \u201cI told you so\u201d impulses. I sent out social media commentary noting how reliably \u201cscience\u201d had predicted the eclipse down to the second and degrees of latitude, and how comfortable everyone was in counting on those predictions. Eclipse glasses were sold out everywhere. But just the same prowess of just the same science is refuted, rejected, and repudiated any time inconvenience or Internet conspiracy theories come calling- on matters of climate, diet, immunization, and more. I wanted to watch the partial eclipse in the sky and think only about this celestial reprieve from the tussles down here, the grandeur of nature. Instead, I was thinking about what hypocrites we are, and how our hypocrisy might very well wind up destroying the one little bit of nature\u2019s grandeur we get to call our own, this heretofore magnificent planet. Advertisement The froward turn of heart partly eclipsed the once-a-century spectacle in the sky, and I regret that. But I regret even more the willful ignorance that allows us to embrace science for the pleasures of just such spectacle, and pejorate it when our very survival is at stake. I regret that the gratifying truth of astronomical prediction did not just douse the sun with moon shadow, but also cast a harsh light on post-truth, alternative-fact narratives . I regret the obstinacy, shortsightedness, egocentrism, profiteering, and opportunism that may cost future generations the treasures of nature, and the natural endowments of scientific insight. Watching the dance of star and moon from this earthly theater we may allow ourselves to ruin- I felt that more than the sun was overcast by shadow. Advertisement There was much more to see in this sky than the moon between us and our sun. There were also all the ways this celestial reality check might provoke us to see and follow new paths between now, and any version of the future our children deserve- assuming, that is, there\u2019s intelligent life down here. -fin David L.

High-Speed Camera Captures Amazing Downward And Upward Lightning Scientists are still mystified about how, exactly, lightning forms. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Jun 14, 2016, 07:46 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A composite image during two Florida thunderstorms showing (at left) downward lightning discharge as it spreads its \"limbs\" out en route to the ground; and (at right) a rare upward burst of lightning. Geospace Physics Laboratory, Dept. of Physics and Space Sciences Florida Institute of Technology Lightning. Most of us have seen or felt the often dramatic and sometimes terrifying gigantic bolts of electricity streaking through the sky during a thunderstorm. It may surprise people to know that for as long as scientists have studied lightning, it's still a bit of a mystery how, exactly, lightning forms. Advertisement In May, researchers at the Florida Institute of Technology filmed the video below. They're using a high-speed camera to capture amazing lightning flashes -- downward ones from thunder clouds, as well as rare upward lightning discharges. These striking videos -- with their real-time speed slowed down -- show multi-bursts of lightning seeming to crawl down (or up!) and opening out into menacing, claw-like appendages, culminating with huge bursts of electrical, bomb-like images. Yet each of the lightning events in the videos lasted less than one second. Advertisement \"We know lightning exists, but it seems that the electric field is not large enough for lightning to get initiated,\" according to physicist and principal investigator Ningyu Liu , of FIT's Geospace Physics Laboratory in Melbourne, Florida. \"Lightning is an electrical discharge process and we know, to start lightning, we need a very large electric field, which can accelerate free electrons inside the cloud. But so far, from measurements, it seems the electric field inside the thunder clouds is actually not that large. Certainly it doesn't exceed the threshold value to start electrical breakdown,\" Liu told The Huffington Post. Liu explains why it's still a mystery how lightning begins. \"It's a very complex process because it's difficult to send electric field sensors in the right region at the right moment,\" Liu said. \"Ideally, we want to put a sensor right before the lightning is initiated to measure the field inside the thunder cloud. But it's very difficult to do that. We can't predict when lightning will begin, where it will propagate and which object on the ground it will strike.\" Advertisement The National Severe Storms Laboratory , located in Norman, Oklahoma, confirms the ongoing mystery over lightning formation: \"Lightning is a giant spark of electricity in the atmosphere between clouds, the air, or the ground. In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning. \"The creation of lightning is a complicated process. We generally know what conditions are needed to produce lightning, but there is still debate about exactly how a cloud builds up electrical charges and how lightning forms.\" Adding to the unknown factor of lightning is the occasional rare moment when nature's electrical outburst moves up instead of down . Advertisement The following video shows some of the scarce upward lightning videotaped by Liu and his team: \"Sometimes lightning can propagate upward from the thunder cloud tops. It can reach 60 to 70 kilometers [about 40 miles] into the low ionosphere,\" said Liu, referring to a conducting layer of the upper atmosphere that helps transmit radio signals around the world. \"For some communication systems, we use this layer to propagate signals from point A to point B. If this ionosphere is modified by upward lightning, then it can produce some disturbances in the communications signals.\" Advertisement Here are more examples of upward lightning from a previous Discovery Channel program, \"Raging Planet\": 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How One Doctor Is Waging War On Bulls**t Science It's about time. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 24, 2016, 01:14 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Illustration by Troy Dunham. Stock images from Getty Images and Shutterstock We all know science is a fantastic tool for explaining our world. But as medical doctor-turned-editor Ivan Oransky knows all too well, it's not perfect. Oransky, global editorial director of the news site MedPage Today and co-founder of the website Retraction Watch , has made a career of spotlighting bad research -- scientific studies so flawed that they aren't worth the paper they're printed on or the pixels they're displayed with. Advertisement Oransky estimates that of the 2-3 million scientific papers published worldwide each year, 500-600 wind up being retracted. That's not a huge number, but it's troubling nonetheless, especially since it seems likely that many errant or fraudulent studies are never identified as such. Dr. Ivan Oransky courtesy Ivan Oransky What's going on here? Who's to blame for this shoddy research -- and how do they get away with it? More to the point, how can those of us eager to learn the latest scientific findings avoid being misled? Advertisement HuffPost Science recently posed those questions and others to Oransky. What explains all this junk science? It's important to distinguish what people commonly refer to as \"junk science\" from fraud and retractions. There are fraudulent studies, which are a tiny rarity. There are studies that don't hold up when they're repeated, which can be more than half of the research in some fields, but have very little or nothing to do with fraud. There are the hundreds of thousands of papers published every year in what are known as \" predatory journals \" that don't really have any quality mechanism. And then there are perfectly well-performed studies that were designed poorly, sometimes in a way that guarantees a result someone wants. About two-thirds of the time, the cause is something that would be considered misconduct: faking the results, making them look better than they are, or good old-fashioned plagiarism. About one in five retractions is due to honest error. Advertisement FabrikaCr via Getty Images Can you give some examples of research that was recently retracted? A couple of much-hyped stem cell papers published in 2014 in the leading journal Nature were retracted after other researchers couldn't reproduce the findings. It turned out that the papers used bad data. Another case involved a study in the journal Science that claimed to show gay people were better at changing people's minds about same-sex marriage. Those data were almost certainly faked. Advertisement How come the journals that publish the bad studies fail to spot them in time? Journal peer reviewers fail to catch the mistakes for a variety of reasons. One that editors usually point to is that if someone is hell-bent on faking results, there's no way for peer reviewers to catch that. That's true even if peer reviewers look at the original data, which is a rare event. But it's also true that scientists are being asked to review more and more papers, and that science is becoming more and more specialized. That means there are fewer experts in any particular subject who can vet research. Who exactly is harmed by bad science? Certainly other scientists can be harmed, because they can spin their wheels pursuing what's actually a dead end. And consumers who want better information on which to base decisions can also be hurt. We're all taxpayers, too, and waste in publicly funded research doesn't help anyone. Advertisement You've said you tend to be more suspicious of research in certain scientific disciplines. Which disciplines, and why? I tend to be much more suspicious of fields that don't retract as often, which may seem counterintuitive. But with a few exceptions -- physics, for example, which doesn't retract partly because most scientists allow for review of their results in public long before they're \"published,\" making retractions much less necessary -- if a field has a higher rate of retraction, that means someone is actually paying attention and trying to correct the scientific record. There are no fields that have a perfect record that would merit zero retractions. What do you look for when you read a study? I always look for the authors' discussion of the limitations of the study. If they don't mention any, I run. If they do, it helps me put the findings in context. I figure out whether a study was published in a peer-reviewed journal. That's not a Good Housekeeping seal of approval, but it at least means someone has looked at it before the press release came out. Advertisement I see whether the study was done in humans, or mice. And I see where it was published. If it was trying to make a claim about clinical medicine, but ended up in a basic science journal, I'm suspicious. I look for what's known as a power calculation, to see if the study was big enough to show an effect. I look for side effects, how many people dropped out of the study, how much the drug or other intervention will cost, who funded the work, and whether there are alternatives. And I seek an outside source, someone without a dog in the fight, to put the findings in context. JacobStudio via Getty Images Advertisement Many studies are retracted after being touted in the media. Aren't journalists supposed to know good science from bad? I wasn't born knowing how to separate good science from bad. To those who were, congratulations! If scientists are letting bad science through peer review, which journals have tried to convince us is necessary before we write about anything, doesn't it stand to reason that some journalists will assume the vetting process has weeded out the junk? Journalists have to be eternally vigilant. What can all of us do to avoid being duped by bad science? I'd suggest taking a look at HealthNewsReview.org and sites like it that critique news coverage, to get a sense of what you might be missing if you don't read skeptically. There are a lot of really good science reporters out there, some at major outlets and some at smaller ones. Take a look at a journalist's record, and how often he or she includes caveats and context, rather than going for a simplistic approach that obscures the true story. Advertisement Is our system of biomedical research essentially broken? If so, what's the fix? As Christie Aschwanden concluded in an excellent piece on FiveThirtyEight , science isn't broken. But the incentives under which it's practiced -- a.k.a. \"publish or perish\" -- and the scientific publishing system are broken. That's what needs fixing.

Scientists Offer Plan To Hide Earth From Advanced Space Aliens Columbia University astronomers say their laser plan would work, but others aren't so sure. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Apr 2, 2016, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Talk about irony. At a time when many astronomers are trying hard to find evidence of alien life, a pair of astronomers at Columbia University are exploring what we might do to keep aliens from finding us . Professor David M. Kipping and graduate student Alan Teachey say in a new paper that lasers could be used as a sort of cloaking device to conceal our planet from aliens' prying eyes . Advertisement By directing laser beams at star systems where aliens might live at just the right time, the astronomers argue, we could compensate for the slight dimming of light that occurs when the Earth crosses in front of, or transits, the sun. (Any aliens who observed a periodic diminution of starlight from our sun could infer the presence of our planet -- just as we have used transits to detect the presence of exoplanets around other stars.) \"It's surprisingly feasible to do this, energywise,\" Teachey told The Huffington Post. \"We could do it this year if we wanted to. We have the technology.\" But why on earth would we want to do this? In fact, the idea of keeping our existence a secret might not be such a silly notion. Advertisement Some scientists have expressed concerns that if aliens knew we were here, they might want to come to Earth to plunder our planet's resources -- or worse. Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, for one, has said that an advanced alien civilization might wipe out the human race the way a person might wipe out a colony of ants. Such concerns have roiled the SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) community in recent years. Some scientists say that, in addition to listening for radio signals from alien civilizations, we should broadcast radio signals to announce ourselves to the cosmos. Others maintain that doing so would expose humanity to needless peril. Advertisement The proposal floated by Teachey and Kipping shifts this conversation to the question of whether we should actively conceal our presence from aliens. According to their paper, published online in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on Wednesday, emitting a 30-megawatt laser for 10 hours once a year would be enough to conceal our transit signal in visible light. That's comparable to the amount of energy needed to run about 70 homes over the course of a year, according to Teachey. But not everyone is convinced the plan is workable. Dr. Meg Urry, director of the Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics at Yale University, deemed the plan \"doable but nutty.\" Advertisement \"Because planets are ubiquitous we'd have to aim lasers at every one of thousands of them,\" she said in an email. \"I'm sure someone could figure out the necessary time series for each star, but since the transits would only be compensated at the exact wavelength of the laser, this would fool the aliens only if their detector technology is identical to ours.\" Moreover, she continued, any civilization capable of detecting us would likely be more technologically advanced than we are, \"in which case our humble efforts to fool them with lasers are probably doomed.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Dr. Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, said the plan could actually backfire. Advertisement \"Advanced societies will sure already have detected the periodic dimming caused by Earth's orbit around the sun,\" Shostak said. \"If that dimming suddenly goes away thanks to our deployment of massively powerful lasers, that will call attention to our world.\" Teachey acknowledged that possibility, adding that he and Kipping weren't pushing for or against the use of a laser cloak. As he told HuffPost, \"We've just run the numbers, and it's up to others to decide what we ought to do.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

This 22-Year-Old Might Have Just Identified 4 New Planets The university student found four \"planet candidates\" outside of our solar system. By Rahel Gebreyes Editor, HuffPost Video Jun 9, 2016, 06:59 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING One 22-year-old's obsession with \"Star Trek\" just helped her make an astronomical discovery. Michelle Kunimoto, while working under University of British Columbia professor Jaymie Matthews, was searching through data from NASA's Kepler Mission in hopes of finding planets other researchers may have missed, the school reported last week. But she didn't just find one -- she found four potential new exoplanets, or planets outside the solar system, which are considered \u201cplanet candidates\u201d until independently confirmed. Advertisement Kunimoto said the science fiction franchise is what first sparked her love for astronomy. \"The moment where I was dead set on it was when my dad introduced my brother and I to the original 'Star Trek' series,\" she said. Kunimoto is most excited about one particular planet, which she estimates to be the size of Neptune, because it may have the perfect environment for water. \"Its temperature, based off of my calculations, is actually within the range of the freezing and boiling point of water, so it could have liquid water on its surface,\" she said. Advertisement The Astronomical Journal is now reviewing Kunimoto\u2019s planets, and she plans to return to UBC in the fall to start her master\u2019s program in physics and astronomy.

Aquarium To Monitor Animals' Behavior Changes During Eclipse The vanishing sunlight during past solar eclipses has thrown off animals' circadian rhythms, research shows. Reuters Aug 21, 2017, 09:34 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This pelican's exhibit at the South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston is one of two that biologists will monitor during Monday's solar eclipse. Reuters Staff / Reuters CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Animals in the path of the first total solar eclipse to travel across the United States in 99 years have a big surprise awaiting them on Monday afternoon, biologists say. Zoos, aquariums and other wildlife parks see the celestial phenomenon as a special research opportunity to observe how birds and mammals react when the moon\u2019s shadow blots out most of the sun\u2019s light in the middle of the day, experts say. Advertisement The South Carolina Aquarium in Charleston, the last spot over which the total eclipse will pass during its coast-to-coast journey, will carefully monitor the behavior of creatures during the minute and 36 seconds when the area goes dark. Biologists have set up video cameras in the Salt Marsh Aviary and Mountain Forest exhibits to gather data. The yellow-crowned night heron is one of two herons at the South Carolina Aquarium's saltwater marsh aviary exhibit. Reuters Staff / Reuters Advertisement In general, researchers are not particularly concerned that the sudden mid-afternoon darkness will upset animals too much even though the eclipse\u2019s approach will come as a complete surprise to them. \u201cA little bit of excitement in the days of the animals is a good thing,\u201d said aviculturist Monty Wallace. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the same thing happening to you everyday.\u201d Past solar eclipses have left animals appearing confused, with the disappearing sunlight throwing off their circadian rhythms, research shows. Advertisement Birds at Zimbabwe\u2019s Mana Pools National Park fell silent while others flew in the direction of their roosts during an eclipse in 2001, while hippos \u201cpaused and looked nervous,\u201d according to a study published in the journal Astronomy and Geophysics. Past solar eclipses have left animals appearing confused, with the disappearing sunlight throwing off their circadian rhythms, research shows. teekid via Getty Images The Charleston aquarium\u2019s aviary exhibit is home to two pelicans, six different types of ducks, two white ibises, two types of seagulls and two herons. Advertisement One of them, a yellow-crowned night heron, is nocturnal, while the other, a little blue heron, is active during the day. \u201cI\u2019m interested to see the different behaviors that they would have naturally occurring but at a wrong time of the day, being in the middle of the day when the eclipse happens,\u201d Wallace said. The nocturnal heron may forage for food instead of hiding in a tree, its normal daytime behavior, the biologist said, while the little blue heron may take refuge in the trees out of fear of nocturnal predators.

At midday on Monday, when the moon\u2019s shadow will begin to cross the sun in Charleston, the otters are usually sleeping, she said. Totality is expected at 2:46 p.m., after the otters awaken from their naps. Advertisement \u201cThey\u2019re either going to sleep through it or they\u2019re going to wake up, expecting their food,\u201d Enter said. On its website, NASA recommends solar eclipse watchers find out for themselves how animals behave during the eclipse by simply observing pets or local wildlife. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's What Happened When I Slept For An Extra Hour Each Night You're supposed to get eight hours of nightly rest. I tried that out for a week. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 9, 2016, 09:57 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Lee-or Atsmon Fruin This story is part of a 10-piece series for which HuffPost staffers agreed to experiment with improving their health and decreasing their stress on the job. It\u2019s also part of our monthlong \u201c Work Well \u201d initiative focusing on thriving in the workplace . Getting just one extra hour of sleep each night might sound easy, but actually doing it for a week was far more difficult -- and rewarding -- than I ever expected. Advertisement As both a health journalist and a wellness junkie, I know that getting a good night's rest is essential to physical and mental health, productivity, mood and well-being. The American Sleep Foundation recommends an average of eight hours per night. But life had recently gotten stressful for me, and sleep was unfortunately the first thing to fall by the wayside. For the past few months as I've been preparing for a book launch (in addition to my demanding day job), I had settled into a nightly routine of six and a half to seven hours of sleep. When I had so much to do, sleeping eight long hours every night (not just on the weekend) seemed like a tall order. But sleep and stress are a vicious cycle: When I get stressed, it's difficult to sleep, and when I'm getting less sleep, I'm more stressed out and less able to get things done. Studies have shown that 24 hours of sleep deprivation can significantly raise stress hormone levels , and as little as four hours of sleep loss has been found to increase stress levels as well. Advertisement \"Stress is to sleep as yin is to yang -- opposite forces that are forever linked,\" Dr. Chris Winter told The Huffington Post in 2013. \"Stress prevents sleep. Sleep deprivation increases stress and its consequences.\" So, I embarked on a personal challenge to get eight full hours of rest. RULES For five days straight, I set out to sleep eight hours each night. Since it usually takes me at least 20 minutes to fall asleep, I made sure to get into bed eight and a half hours before I needed to wake up in the morning. Throughout the week, I'll practice good sleep hygiene -- using my bed only for sleep, making sure the room is dark and the temperature is comfortable, and using a sound machine to block out street noise. Carolyn Gregoire Advertisement PREDICTIONS I knew it would be difficult for me to get in bed early enough, but I was prepared to change my habits just for a week. I hoped to feel a little less stressed by the end of it. DAILY DIARY Day 1 It's Monday morning and I am TIRED. Hopping into bed early on Sunday night and getting a full night's rest, it seemed, had left me even more exhausted than usual in the morning -- as if finally getting a decent night's sleep had left my body wanting more. I'm a little tired throughout the day, but feeling a bit more productive and alert than usual. Day 2 I get in bed at 11 p.m. on Monday, fall asleep probably around 11:30 p.m. and wake up at 7:45 a.m. (admittedly, after pressing the snooze button twice). It's still difficult to wake up, but today my energy is pretty even throughout the day, and I surprise myself with how much I get done. Advertisement Day 3 I wake up without pressing the snooze this morning -- a small victory. Again I notice that my energy is even throughout the day. I hit a bit of a wall at 3 p.m. and have a green tea, but otherwise I work pretty steadily through the day until 6 p.m. Tonight, I actually look forward to crawling into bed early. Day 4 I went to bed at 11:25 p.m. yesterday and woke up at 7:30 a.m. feeling pretty amazing! It always takes me a while to fall asleep, but still, I think this means that I got a little more than eight hours of sleep -- and I'm feeling pretty good about it. The day goes by in a flash, and I don't even need a second cup of coffee. Jawbone Advertisement Day 5 I get eight and a half hours of sleep on Thursday night (which requires leaving an event early but is so worth it) and I wake up feeling good. I'm not quite brimming with morning energy yet, but feeling better (and less stressed) than I've felt all week. An unexpected urgent assignment comes my way and I calmly tackle it without getting stressed about all the other things I needed to get done today (for me, this is a significant victory). KEY TAKEAWAYS Looking back, I notice that over the course of the week I've gotten work done more efficiently -- completing my daily tasks and getting through my to-do list with less time and effort required. My to-do list is still long, but somehow I felt less overwhelmed by it. That sense of having way too much on my plate has dissipated considerably. I even feel the spark of an insight: There is time, and energy, for everything that matters. Advertisement \u201cThe bottom line? Getting enough sleep requires making sleep a priority.\u201d The most striking -- and most unexpected -- effect of the challenge was what it did to my stress levels. By the end of the week, although I was still facing the same demands and stresses, I felt much more in control. Carolyn Gregoire Advertisement WHAT'S NEXT? After a week, I've just begun the journey to change my sleep habits, and it's going to take more time and continued effort to feel the effects. Still, it only took five days for me to begin to remember what it feels like to be truly rested. The bottom line? Getting enough sleep requires making sleep a priority. Yes, you might have to go home a little early from a party, sacrifice your morning run or find a way to work just one hour less, but it's so worth it. Ultimately, it's one of the easiest things that anyone can do to feel better and less stressed. I'm converted!

Zoom Into The Mesmerizing Heart Of Our Own Milky Way Galaxy Stunning video takes us into the center of the galaxy, which is packed with stars. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Apr 1, 2016, 11:34 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Ever wondered what it would be like to travel to the center of the Milky Way? Now you can find out. Sort of. The Hubble Space Telescope stared deep into the heart of our own galaxy to capture a mesmerizing image of its nuclear star cluster. Advertisement Scientists then used the detailed picture to produce a stunning video (above), which starts with a broad view of the Milky Way and zooms viewers into its center. The nuclear cluster, containing half a million stars, surrounds the galaxy's central \"supermassive black hole,\" according to a statement on Hubble's website. Advertisement \"So packed with stars, it is equivalent to having a million suns crammed into the volume of space between us and our closest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light-years away,\u201d the statement adds. It's almost impossible to spot the cluster, located 27,000 light-years away, with the naked eye. Astronomers used infrared vision to \"pierce through\" the galaxy's dust. They then translated the infrared light into colors we can see. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The image from which the video was made (below) spans 50 light-years across and was stitched together from 9 separate photographs taken by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. The larger blue foreground stars are not part of the cluster. Advertisement \"The 'snowstorm' of stars in the image is just the tip of the iceberg: Astronomers estimate that about 10 million stars in this cluster are too faint to be captured in this image,\" the statement says. The Milky Way video was made using this image, which spans 50 light-years across.

Cutting Carbon Emissions Could Save Lives Sooner Than You May Think It could save up to 175,000 people in the U.S. -- and $250 billion -- by 2030. By Casey Williams On assignment for HuffPost Feb 23, 2016, 05:42 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Pollution from a power plant. A new study shows cutting carbon emissions could prevent thousands of deaths in the U.S. by 2030. zhuyongming via Getty Images Slashing carbon emissions won\u2019t just ease global warming. It could also save thousands of lives in the U.S. by drastically reducing deaths caused by air pollution. The cuts in carbon emissions needed to limit the rise of global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) would significantly reduce other kinds of air pollution, according to a new study by researchers at Duke University and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Advertisement The study, published Monday in Nature Climate Change , showed that these cuts in pollution could prevent the premature deaths of up to 175,000 people in the U.S. by 2030 and save around $250 billion annually in associated health costs. The new research sheds light on how tackling climate change can result in not only long-term benefits, but can also address health issues in the short term, said Drew Shindell, professor of climate sciences at Duke and lead author of the study. \"Many people view climate change as a future problem, but our analysis shows that reducing emissions that cause warming -- many of which also contribute to air pollution -- would benefit public health here and now,\" he said in a statement . Advertisement The health and economic benefits associated with easing global warming could sway people's priorities, Rachel Cleetus, lead economist and climate policy manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was not involved in the study, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. There are now \" very good here-and-now public health reasons to make the shift to cleaner energy,\" she said. A chemical plant factory in the 1970s. Policies designed to ease global warming could have immediate health and economic benefits, a new study shows. H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock via Getty Images Advertisement Reducing carbon emissions -- especially from power plants and vehicles -- prevents other pollutants, such as sulfur oxides, mercury and lead, from spewing into the atmosphere. Shindell and his research team calculated how much emissions from these co-pollutants would decrease if the U.S. were to slash carbon emissions in the transportation and energy sectors by 75 and 63 percent, respectively. The researchers then calculated the number of premature deaths caused by those co-pollutants each year by looking at medical data documenting the links between chemical exposure and death. Using that data, researchers were able to figure out how many deaths from air pollution could be avoided under their emissions reduction scenarios. They found that cutting emissions from transportation by 75 percent could prevent up to 120,000 premature deaths by 2030. Reducing emissions from energy production by 63 percent could prevent up to 175,000 deaths over the same period. Advertisement The researchers also found that preventing these early deaths would save the country around $250 billion in public health costs every year. When the global health and climate effects of reduced emissions are taken into account, the long-term savings would roughly quintuple , according to a press release. \u201cThe cost of clean energy transition starts to pale compared to the benefits.\u201d - Rachel Cleetus, Union of Concerned Scientists The study employed the same methodology used by the EPA in its analysis of President Barack Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. The EPA and this new study both confirm research that was published last year in Nature Climate Change showing that reducing carbon emissions from U.S. power plants would likely improve public health. Advertisement The new study is \"very consistent with what other studies show: shifting away from fossil fuels has huge public health co-benefits in addition to the climate benefits,\" Cleetus said. But securing those health benefits will be difficult, Shindell told HuffPost. \"We would need enormous national will to change the way we get energy and provide transportation services,\" he said. \"But it could really be done if we wanted to do this.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In the long run, the advantages of moving away from fossil fuels outweigh the costs, according to Cleetus. That's because while fossil fuels appear cheap, they contain what Cleetus calls \"disguised costs.\" Advertisement \"When we do a true calculation for public health costs, we realize it\u2019s a different equation,\" Cleetus said. \"The cost of clean energy transition starts to pale compared to the benefits.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Thermite-Filled Pumpkins Explode Into Fireballs, And It's Wicked Fun Jack-o-lantern tension comes to a head. By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Oct 27, 2015, 04:14 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT As the narrator says in a whimsical new video posted by the London-based charity The Royal Institution , it's time \"to explore the previously unknown interface between pumpkins and thermite .\" Dude, just tell us you're blowing up pumpkins, and we're yours. Watch the gourd pyrotechnics play out when jack-o-lanterns mingle with iron oxide and aluminum powder. Ignited by a strip of magnesium, the reaction causes temperatures as high as 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the video. That prompts molten iron to spill from one jack-o-lantern's mouth into the head of another. Advertisement Then voila, a fireball-spewing Halloween spectacular!
