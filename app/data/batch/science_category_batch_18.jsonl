NASA Aircraft Spots Mysterious Circles In Remote Arctic Sea Ice Scientists say they haven't seen these features before. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 23, 2018, 05:45 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA/John Sonntag/Operation IceBridge NASA scientists are working to solve a mystery in the Arctic ice. Operation IceBridge is a project that sends flights over both polar regions to photograph and map land and sea ice. And images that were taken during a flight on April 14 over the Beaufort Sea, 50 miles northwest of the Mackenzie River Delta, showed a series of unusual shapes in the sea ice. \u201c We saw these sorta-circular features only for a few minutes today ,\u201d mission scientist John Sonntag wrote from the field, per NASA. \u201cI don\u2019t recall seeing this sort of thing elsewhere.\u201d Advertisement NASA also released an image with the main features labeled: NASA/John Sonntag/Operation IceBridge NASA said some of the features had an easy explanation: The ice in the area was young and thin. When these types of floes collide, \u201cfinger rafting\u201d \u2015 the zipper-like feature at the top right \u2015 will form. However, the agency conceded that the holes were little harder to explain, and no one could quite say for sure what caused them. \u201cThe encircling features may be due to waves of water washing out over the snow and ice when the seals surface,\u201d Walt Meier, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said in a news release. \u201cOr it could be a sort of drainage feature that results from when the hole is made in the ice.\u201d Advertisement Other experts contacted by NASA agreed that the features could be breathing holes made by seals as well as other possibilities, including warm groundwater flowing out to the sea ice from inland mountains.

How To Watch The Eclipse Without Burning Holes In Your Eyeballs Protect your retina from painful burns. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 25, 2017, 04:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING The 2017 solar eclipse soon be here, and NASA has issued some basics to help make sure you can see the big event without damaging your eyes. The Aug. 21 eclipse will travel across 14 states along a path 70 miles wide, giving millions a chance to view what for many may be a once-in-a-lifetime event. Advertisement But NASA warns that it\u2019s unsafe to watch the eclipse without proper protection \u2015 and sunglasses won\u2019t protect you from retinal burns . The agency said to use special eclipse viewing glasses with the designated ISO 12312-2 international standard along with the manufacturer\u2019s name and address on the product to ensure it\u2019s the real deal. NASA advised not to use lenses more than 3 years old, or ones that have been scratched or wrinkled. The viewing glasses are widely available for purchase, and nearly 5,000 libraries are giving them away . Check with yours to see if they\u2019re participating. Advertisement The space agency said a welder\u2019s hood with a shade number 14 filter or darker would also be effective, but it warned that not all hoods meet that standard so check first. Another option is a pinhole projector. NASA has a link to one you can MacGyver with a cereal box, a piece of white paper and some tin foil . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Minivan-Sized Sea Sponge Is Thought To Be Planet's Largest The ancient brain-like organism was found at a depth of 7,000 feet in waters off Hawaii. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost May 27, 2016, 10:15 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Scientists exploring a deep swath of ocean in the Hawaiian archipelago got an unexpected surprise when they stumbled across a monstrous bottom-dwelling creature. Earthlings, soak in the largest sponge ever recorded -- and what scientists say could very well be one of the planet's oldest living animals. Advertisement NOAA Office of Exploration and Research/Hohonu Moana 2015 The discovery, made last summer by a team of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists aboard the agency's 224-foot Okeanos Explorer , is documented in a report published this week in the journal Marine Biodiversity. The sponge was found in Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument , a World Heritage Site, at a depth of 7,000 feet. It measured roughly 12 feet long, 7 feet tall and 5 feet wide -- about the size of a minivan. Advertisement Daniel Wagner, a NOAA research specialist and co-leader of the expedition, said \"finding such an enormous and presumably old sponge emphasizes how much can be learned from studying deep and pristine environments,\" including Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea. NOAA Office of Exploration and Research/Hohonu Moana 2015 Previously, the largest documented sponge was one discovered in 1887 off the coast of western Canada in less than 100 feet of water, according to the report. That sponge was comparable in length to the one found northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands, but not nearly as tall or wide. Advertisement Wagner and co-author Christopher Kelley note in their report that some marine sponges have been estimated to live more than 2,300 years and attain massive sizes, \"providing key ecosystem services such as filtering large amounts of seawater, as well as providing important habitat to a myriad of invertebrate and microbial species.\" The recent discovery, they wrote, \"underscores the need to protect this area using the highest conservation measures available.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

New Research Offers Much-Needed Hope For Our Oceans \"We can have our fish and eat it too.\" By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 28, 2016, 03:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Earth's fisheries are in bad shape -- populations of some stocks, including tuna and mackerel, declined 74 percent between 1970 and 2010. A new study, however, offers a glimmer of hope of what we could expect in the not-so-distant future if global action is taken. The study , published in Monday's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , finds that with better fishing practices, the majority of the world's fisheries -- 77 percent, to be exact -- could recover to a healthy state within a decade. And by 2050, global fish populations could double, resulting in a 204 percent profit increase for the world's fishermen. Amanda Leland, senior vice president for oceans at the Environmental Defense Fund and a co-author of the study, called the findings surprising and inspiring. Advertisement \"There's a really positive story right around the corner,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"We can have our fish and eat it too.\" \"It would be very hard to find another global, significant environmental challenge that could be solved so quickly,\" Leland added.

David Fleetham via Getty Images Advertisement For the study, researchers from the Environmental Defense Fund, the University of Washington and the University of California, Santa Barbara analyzed data from 4,713 fisheries worldwide -- representing 78 percent of global reported fish catch. To no surprise, they found that business as usual would result in a \"continued collapse for many of the world's fisheries.\" Sustainable management reforms, however, including science-based catch limits, could generate yearly increases of more than 16 million metric tons of seafood, with annual profits of $53 billion, according to the research. In other words, sustainable fishing practices not only offer environmental benefits, but also long-term economic benefits. Advertisement \"We no longer need to see ocean fisheries as a series of trade-offs,\" Chris Costello, the paper\u2019s lead author and a professor of environmental and resource economics at UC Santa Barbara, said in an emailed statement to HuffPost. \"In fact, we show that we can have more fish in the water, more food on the plate, and more prosperous fishing communities -- and it can happen relatively quickly,\" he added.

Jeff Rotman via Getty Images Advertisement The new research offers a bit of good news in a seemingly never-ending ocean of bad. For instance, a study published last year by the World Wildlife Fund found that many of the planet\u2019s fish populations were on the \u201c brink of collapse .\" And in January, a study by the World Economic Forum and Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that the world\u2019s oceans will be home to more plastic than fish by 2050. Leland is among those who believes a turnaround is possible. However, she said that it will require people, particularly those in leadership positions, stepping up to do the right thing. Implementing fishing rights -- which \"end the desperate race for fish by asking fishermen and women to adhere to strict, science-based catch limits in exchange for a right to a share of the catch or to a traditional fishing area\" -- has shown great success in places like Australia, Belize, Chile and the U.S., the authors wrote in a press release. Advertisement \"We now have a clear roadmap for how to recover fisheries: Give fishermen secure fishing rights so they can control and protect their future,\" Leland said.

Richard Branson Returns To Passenger Space Travel Race With New Craft The \"Unity\" was named by British physicist Stephen Hawking. Reuters Feb 20, 2016, 08:40 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING MOJAVE, Calif., Feb 19 (Reuters) - Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic venture unveiled a new passenger spacecraft on Friday, nearly 16 months after a fatal accident destroyed its sister ship during a test flight over California's Mojave Desert. The rollout of the gleaming craft, dubbed Virgin Space Ship Unity, marks Branson 's return to a race among rival billionaire entrepreneurs to develop a vehicle that can take thrill-seekers, researchers and commercial customers on short hops into space. Advertisement \"It's almost too good to be true,\" Branson said during a ceremony at the Mojave Air and Space Port, about 100 miles (160 km) north of Los Angeles. \"When I saw it for the first time, it brought an immediate lump to my throat and tears to my eyes. It was a completely overwhelming moment.\" Richard Branson poses with employees in front of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo space tourism rocket after it was unveiled on Friday. ASSOCIATED PRESS Christened with a bottle of milk by Branson 's year-old granddaughter, the ship was painted bright white on its front section, fading to gray and black toward the tail. Advertisement The tail itself was emblazoned with a blue image of a peering eye belonging to famed British physicist Stephen Hawking. Branson has already offered a flight into space to Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair and suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. It was Hawking who suggested naming the ship Unity.

Al Seib via Getty Images Advertisement \"I have always dreamed of spaceflight, but for so many years I thought it was just that - a dream,\" Hawking said in a recorded message played at the space port. \"If I am able to go, and if Richard will still take me, I will be proud to fly on this spaceship.\" From outward appearances, the spacecraft is nearly identical to the one lost on Oct. 31, 2014. The accident was blamed on pilot error and oversights by Northrop Gumman Corp's Scaled Composites division, which designed, built and tested the vehicle, known as SpaceShipTwo. Virgin Galactic's own manufacturing arm, The Spaceship Company, already was well into construction of the successor ship when the accident occurred. Advertisement The biggest difference between the two is the addition of a pin to prevent a pilot from unlocking the ship's rotating tail section too soon before descent, which is what triggered the breakup of the first spaceship, said Galactic Chief Executive George Whitesides.

Al Seib via Getty Images The two-pilot, six-passenger spaceship is designed to reach altitudes of 62 miles (100 km) above the planet, providing a few minutes of weightlessness and a view of Earth set against the blackness of space. Nearly 700 people have signed up for rides, which cost $250,000 each. Advertisement Other changes include a device to prevent pilots from releasing the ship's landing gear too early and new control switches to make them more distinct. Friday's unveiling set the stage for Unity's first round of test flights. The company has declined to discuss a schedule, but Whitesides said he expects to rapidly repeat milestones the first craft achieved and then incrementally test the new ship at higher speeds and altitudes. The first spaceship had not yet traveled beyond the atmosphere. Sir Richard Branson, about to christen the new Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo at its roll out. Al Seib via Getty Images Advertisement Virgin Galactic is among a handful of companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Paul Allen's Stratolaunch Systems and Boeing, planning to fly people in space. Building a vehicle that can safely carry humans to the weightless heights beyond Earth's upper atmosphere is a feat so far achieved only by NASA, Russia, China and Scaled Composites, which designed and flew Virgin Galactic's prototype craft, SpaceShipOne. Three suborbital hops by SpaceShipOne in 2004 earned it the $10 million Ansari XPrize.

When Hidden Figures premiered in theaters this past December, it drew attention to a less discussed issue: The discrimination and sexism faced by women of color in the early days of the space race. The movie was based on a true story of three black women at NASA in the 1960s. Sadly, the challenges the movie addresses are far from over. In a study released this week in the Journal of Geophysical Research , researchers found that women of color in astronomy and earth sciences face a disturbing amount of harassment in the workplace. According to the survey of over 400 people in the two fields, women of color said they felt unsafe at work 40% of the time (28% of which they attributed to their race), while 18% said they avoided work events because of these concerns. \"How do you become a fantastic scientist if you're not in the room to do science or learn science?\" Christina Richey, one of the study's authors and the former chair of the American Astronomical Society Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy, told Refinery29. \"And how can we say that we're creating the next generation of the best scientists possible if we're creating an environment that also makes them feel too unsafe to attend an event?\" Advertisement Richey said she has observed these issues in the workplace for years, but that when she has raised them with leadership, her superiors brushed them off as anecdotal. Now, with the stats to prove what she and many other women see, the issues won't be so easy to dismiss. The study notes how women of color have to deal with gender and racial discrimination, a \"double jeopardy.\" PHOTO: HOPPER STONE/LEVANTINE/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK. Advertisement \"When I started looking at the results, I realized that it wasn't just that the community wanted to discuss the issue, it was that we had serious, serious issues going on, and that the community was desperate for an outlet,\" Richey said. \"As someone who's worked on this issue for many years within this field and with these people, I know these respondents. I know their faces, I know their lives. They are my friends and my colleagues. I'll admit that I had a very stiff drink and cried myself to sleep that night [after I first looked at the results].\" Though we're used to hearing about the challenges women face in Silicon Valley, astronomy and earth sciences don't get as much attention. One key moment for this issue came up in 2015, when it was revealed that renowned astronomer Geoff Marcy had engaged in decades of sexual harassment. Richey said she feels the reality check that's happening in the tech industry at the moment, especially as the aftermath of Susan Fowler's Uber experience plays out, is overdue within the earth sciences and astronomy. While she says that the American Geophysical Union and American Astronomical Society have taken important steps to further the discussion around these issues, including holding a racism town hall, more needs to be done \u2014 especially in terms of research. Advertisement In response to a request for comment on the study, a NASA spokesperson provided Refinery29 with the following statement: \"NASA does not tolerate sexual harassment, and nor should any organization seriously committed to workplace equality, diversity and inclusion. Science is for everyone, and any behavior that demeans or discourages people from fully participating is unacceptable. The agency takes very seriously its obligations, both legal and ethical, to make sure that when it provides federal dollars to a STEM educational program that the program is extending equal opportunity to all of its participants.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Manmade Earthquakes Are Putting Even More Of The Country At Risk You're more likely to experience a damaging earthquake this year if you live in Oklahoma than if you live in California. By Lydia O'Connor Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 28, 2016, 05:20 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This is the first USGS hazard report to factor in manmade earthquakes. The oil and gas industry is considered the primary cause of such quakes. Seven million Americans risk facing one in 2016. Millions of Americans live in areas that could be affected by manmade earthquakes in the next year, according a new assessment from the U.S. Geological Survey. The oil and gas industry's wastewater disposal methods are putting about 7 million people at risk , the federal agency announced Monday in an earthquake hazard report. It's common for companies to dispose of a drilling byproduct called wastewater by injecting it underground. This practice puts additional pressure on faults in the ground and drives them apart, scientists have observed. Advertisement Gary Landra stands on a crack across his basement floor that he says was caused by an earthquake in Prague, Oklahoma. A new report from the USGS says that north-central Oklahoma has the country's highest risk of experiencing a damaging earthquake in 2016. The Washington Post via Getty Images \"By including human-induced events, our assessment of earthquake hazards has significantly increased in parts of the United States,\" Mark Petersen, chief of the USGS National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project, said in a call with reporters Monday. This was the first USGS report to consider risks posed by both natural and human-induced quakes. Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas are the states most at risk, he added. California has long been considered the nation's earthquake capital. However, factoring in manmade quakes gives north-central Oklahoma the highest risk of experiencing a damaging earthquake this year, with a 12 percent chance. Advertisement USGS A 5.1-magnitude earthquake already struck the area last month, although it's unclear whether wastewater injection triggered the quake. However, wastewater injection did lead to a 5.7-magnitude quake in the area in 2011 , the USGS determined. The risk shouldn't come as a surprise to residents in most of these regions. The report notes that the rate of earthquakes first began increasing in the Central and Eastern United States in 2010 -- a phenomenon other studies have linked to increased wastewater injection in deep disposal wells in those regions.

While current research suggests that these human-induced quakes may have lower maximum magnitudes than traditional quakes, some scientists think these manmade quakes could contribute to larger earthquakes on natural fault lines. Advertisement \"We are using the best available data and principles to determine when, where and how strong the ground could shake from induced earthquakes ,\" Petersen said in a release accompanying the study. \"Of course there is a level of uncertainty associated with this and all hazard maps, as we are still learning about their behavior and can only forecast with probability\u2014instead of predict with certainty\u2014where earthquakes are likely to occur in the future.

Cheeky Video Explains The Entire Universe In Just Over 4 Minutes From atoms to the solar system, it's all there. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost May 30, 2016, 03:54 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Need some help in understanding the universe? Then check out this entertaining -- and slightly risqu\u00e9 -- video by British YouTuber Exurb1a , who does his best to break it all down in just over four minutes. Exurb1a 's humorous whistle-stop explainer begins with The Planck Length , before moving on to cover neutrinos, quarks and atoms, the periodic table and DNA. He then focuses on the bigger stuff, such as the Solar System and black holes. However, as the 26-year-old notes, \"Nothing means anything and we're all going to die.\" Advertisement He has a point. Exurb1a , a philosophy PhD student who currently lives in eastern Europe, does go off-piste during the video. There's a dig at an ex-girlfriend, and he pokes fun at several celebrities. But that hasn't stopped the clip, which he posted to YouTube on May 23, from going viral. Many viewers have likened it to Bill Wurtz's similarly quirky 9-minute history of Japan . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Right Way To Care For Your Contacts, According To Chemistry We can't believe we have to say this, but don't store them in beer. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 19, 2016, 12:58 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT If you wear contact lenses, you're going to want to put them in and watch this. In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that about 99 percent of U.S. adults who wear contacts are taking care of them all wrong . That bit of information is just one of many featured in a video (above) released Thursday by the American Chemical Society's Reactions series . Not handling your contacts properly can result in some serious health consequences. \"Contacts interfere with the movement and mixing of tears, which have their own antimicrobial properties and can boost the defenses of the thin layer of cells that cover your cornea,\" narrator Noel Waghorn, the lead producer and writer for the Reactions series, says in the video. Advertisement To that end, here are some science-backed tips from the video to follow when caring for your contacts: Never let water and contacts mix. Make sure to let your case air-dry completely when it's not in use. Use new solution every time when storing your contacts in their case. Rub your contacts each time you rinse and clean them.

Teaching Robots To Be Moral Teaching Robots To Be Moral By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Mar 15, 2015, 10:27 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Skull of a human size robot isolated on black \u201cChappie,\u201d the highest-grossing movie in America last weekend, is, to put it mildly, not a great film; the critics have given it a twenty-nine on Rotten Tomatoes, and it is nowhere near as original as \u201cDistrict 9,\u201d an earlier effort by the director, Neill Blomkamp. \u201cChappie\u201d does not have the philosophical depth of \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or the remade \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d series. Nor does it have the visual panache of \u201cInterstellar\u201d or \u201c2001.\u201d From its opening scene, the film comes across as little more than a warmed-over \u201cRoboCop\u201d remake, relocated to Johannesburg. There\u2019s an evil company man, droids that menace the population, and a whole lot of blood, shooting, and broken glass. About the only thing that seems new is the intermittently adorable android protagonist, Chappie.

If You Thought Your Morals Were Unshakeable, This Study Proves Otherwise If You Thought Your Morals Were Unshakeable, This Study Proves Otherwise By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 16, 2015, 02:40 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Young woman high section, portrait, close-up Is it ever OK to cheat on your spouse? Is murder ever justified? You may think your decisions are based on unshakeable moral convictions -- but your moral decisions may be simply a result of where you're looking at a given moment. According to a provocative new study, eye movements and visual input play a large role in how we deliberate about moral questions. Advertisement The new study -- a collaboration between Swedish, British and American researchers -- is the first to suggest that a person's gaze is closely related to the way they make moral decisions, and therefore that a person's immediate surroundings may exert a significant influence on complex ethical judgments. Say, for example, you've recently decided to become a vegetarian because you believe it is immoral to eat meat. But when you're out at a restaurant, you're tempted to order your favorite meat dish. How do you decide what to order? \"If you're wavering on this decision, something as subtle as the waiter walking up to the table at the moment that your eyes happened to be momentarily resting on the chicken cacciatore menu item (and not on the pasta primavera) could be what sways you into ordering a meal that conflicts with a moral belief you've embraced,\" one of the study's authors, University of California Merced psychologist Dr. Michael Spivey, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"If that waiter had arrived half a second earlier or later, our vegetarian may have been fixating on the pasta at that moment and ordered it.\" Advertisement But what about more weighty moral questions -- like the ethics of murder or adultery? To test how a person's gaze affects these kinds of decisions, the researchers tracked a group of study participants' eyes as they pondered questions such as \"Is murder sometimes justifiable?\" Each participant was given the option to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" based on what they believed to be morally right. Unbeknownst to the participant, the researchers were tracking the movements of their eyes between two targets -- the word \"yes\" and the word \"no\" positioned on opposite sides of a screen -- while they deliberated. When the participant focused on one of the words for a slightly longer period of time than the other, the researchers asked them to immediately call out their decision. They found that the subjects' moral decisions were significantly biased towards the word that they were looking at at the time of the decision. So if the participant was looking at the word \"yes,\" then they were 8 percent more likely to decide that murder is sometimes justifiable. Advertisement Why? It seems that the images of the words \"yes\" and \"no\" influenced the participants' thought processes. Our eyes move three to four times each second, and the images we collect at each movement can affect cognition, Spivey said. \"If the dynamics of the visual environment are arranged in such a way as to take advantage of that influence, then the same person could find themselves making a subtly different sequence of eye movements in one visual context compared to another,\" Spivey said. \"That different sequence of sensory impressions could make them produce different answers to the same question, even a question about their moral beliefs.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This suggests that our moral choices are driven not only by our most deeply held ethical beliefs, but also by a variety of other factors -- some of which are outside of our conscious awareness. Advertisement \"This research demonstrates that many of your moral decisions may arise 'on the fly' as a result of how you look at and interact with your environment,\" Spivey said. \"Like many everyday decisions, moral decisions do not always come from deeply held beliefs in a person's brain, but instead can emerge from the unpredictable momentary interactions between a person and their surroundings.\" The findings were published on March 16 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Scientists May One Day Treat Schizophrenia By Targeting Brain Inflammation An important finding opens up new avenues for treating and preventing the psychotic disorder. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Oct 19, 2015, 03:54 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Science Photo Library - SCIEPRO via Getty Images A new discovery may fundamentally alter our understanding of schizophrenia, a devastating mental illness that affects roughly 1 percent of the adult population. Scientists at London's Imperial College and King's College found that schizophrenia may be caused at least in part by inflammation of the brain -- which suggests that targeting neuroinflammation may be a new way to treat the disorder. Advertisement \"This may provide a unique opportunity for treatment or prevention of schizophrenia, following the appropriate clinical trials,\" said Dr. Peter Bloomsfield, a neuroscientist at Imperial College and the lead author of the study, which was published last week in the American Journal of Psychiatry. The study showed that microglia, or the immune cells found in the nervous system, are more active in the brains of people with schizophrenia as well as those of people who are at risk for the disorder. For the study, the researchers examined the brains of 56 adults using a technique known as positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Some participants had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, while others were at risk for the disorder -- meaning they had mild psychotic symptoms and/or family history -- and some had no symptoms and were not at risk. Advertisement The scans revealed that individuals with schizophrenia showed high levels of microglia activity in their brains, and as that microglia activity increased along with the severity of symptoms. What the activity of microglia indicates is a response to infection and damage in the brain through the process known as inflammation. The scans revealed, moreover, that people who were at risk for schizophrenia showed higher levels of microglia activity than those who were not at risk for the disorder. Peter Bloomfield et al. Advertisement Previously, doctors had not known if these cells became active before or after the onset of the disorder. The discovery may open up the door for an entirely new approach to schizophrenia prevention and treatment. So far, treatments have focused on changes in the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. But through early testing for neuroinflammation markers, doctors may be able to treat schizophrenia before its most debilitating symptoms occur. \"With this finding... there is a new theory to explore,\" Bloomfield said. \"This means we can start to investigate new medication targeting microglial cells and inflammation to see if we can treat schizophrenia in established patients or prevent it in those at risk.\" Advertisement The researchers still aren't yet sure how inflammation in the brain leads to psychotic symptoms in some people, but future studies may offer some important answers. \"Schizophrenia is a potentially devastating disorder and we desperately need new treatments to help sufferers, and ultimately to prevent it,\" Dr. Oliver Howes, a psychiatric imaging expert at King's College and one of the study's authors, said in a statement . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Uranus Is Actually A Giant Ball Of Farts Floating In Space, Study Finds However, the smell could quite literally be the last thing you notice. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 24, 2018, 05:01 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Someone light a match. In a study making people everywhere giggle, researchers found that much of the upper atmosphere of Uranus is hydrogen sulfide. That\u2019s the same compound responsible for some odors familiar here on Earth, including farts and rotten eggs. \u201cIf an unfortunate human were ever to descend through Uranus\u2019s clouds, they would be met with very unpleasant and odiferous conditions ,\u201d Patrick Irwin from the University of Oxford, one of the study\u2019s authors, said in a news release. Advertisement On the other hand, the smell could quite literally be the last thing you notice. \u201cSuffocation and exposure in the -200 degrees Celsius atmosphere made of mostly hydrogen, helium and methane would take its toll long before the smell,\u201d Irwin said. The Gemini North telescope, right, in Hawaii. EduardMoldoveanuPhotography via Getty Images Scientists used data from the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to take a long-distance sniff of the atmosphere above the clouds of Uranus and solve one of the stinkiest mysteries of the Solar System. While some scientists have long thought Uranus had high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, others believed the planet would contain ammonia, as had been observed in Jupiter and Saturn. Advertisement The Gemini data, published this week in journal Nature Astronomy , confirmed that Uranus stinks. \u201cNow, thanks to improved hydrogen sulfide absorption-line data and the wonderful Gemini spectra, we have the fingerprint which caught the culprit,\u201d said Irwin. Or maybe he who smelt it, dealt it.

NASA Received An Earth-Shattering Number Of Astronaut Applications A lot of Americans want to leave the planet, apparently. By Samantha Guff Associate Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 19, 2016, 03:15 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT This could be you, if you were one of the 18,300 people who applied to join NASA's 2017 astronaut class. Getty Images Think you have what it takes to be an astronaut? A record number of people believe they have the right stuff: NASA received more than 18,300 applications for its 2017 astronaut class. That's three times the number of applicants for the previous class in 2012 and far exceeds the record of 8,000 applicants set in 1978. The spike in applications is likely due, at least in part, to NASA's #BeAnAstronaut social media campaign.

Drivers Show Signs Of Racial Bias At Crosswalks, Initial Study Finds The researchers are currently conducting a bigger study on the subject. By Andy Campbell Senior Editor, HuffPost Oct 17, 2015, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Does the race of a pedestrian determine whether a driver will stop to let them cross the street? A joint preliminary study by researchers at the University of Arizona and Portland State University suggests that it is. The study -- which, it should be noted, had an extremely small sample size and was based in one city -- found that African-Americans had to wait in a crosswalk about 32 percent longer than white people before drivers stopped. The research also suggests that African-Americans are twice as likely to be passed by multiple vehicles. The findings, co-authored by a University of Arizona transportation planning expert and two Portland State University students, were published in August in Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behavior . The researchers trained six participants -- three white, three black -- and had them stand at a crosswalk in downtown Portland, Oregon. Then researchers observed 88 trials, cataloguing how many cars passed without letting the pedestrian cross and how long it took for a driver to finally stop. \"Drivers were clearly displaying behaviors consistent with implicit racial bias,\" study co-author Arlie Adkins said. \"It was not a very large study, so we weren't sure the amount of data collected would be enough to reach statistical significance, so we were surprised to see how quickly the significance showed up.\" Advertisement Tara Goddard, a doctoral candidate in urban studies at Portland State and co-author of the study, said the research has broader implications even though its sample size was so small and it only took place in one city. She, Adkins and co-author Kimberly Kahn received a $30,000 grant from the National Institute for Transportation and Community to expand on the study, and are putting the finishing touches on more comprehensive research on the subject. The study wasn't meant to prove that drivers are \"overtly racist,\" but that they could have implicit bias that leads to danger on the road, researchers said. \"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that during a period that spanned 2000 to 2012, African-American and Hispanic male pedestrians were more than twice as likely than white men to die in traffic crashes,\" they write in the study. Advertisement Are those crashes caused by implicit bias? \" We\u2019re not saying this is the missing link, but it's worth exploring,\" Goddard told The Huffington Post. \"It\u2019s likely happening at a subconscious level.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Ceres' Four-Mile Tall 'Pyramid' Is Closer Than Ever, Still Puzzling \"How the mountain formed is not yet understood. It is a big -- VERY BIG -- mystery to us right now.\" By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 25, 2015, 02:36 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The closer we get to Ceres, the largest object in our solar system's asteroid belt, the stranger it becomes. In June, NASA released a photo of Ceres, taken by the Dawn spacecraft from 2,700 miles away, that showed a several-mile high \"pyramid\" protruding from the dwarf planet's otherwise generally smooth surface. And a new photo, taken last Wednesday from only 900 miles away, shows the mountain is four miles high and has a perimeter of previously unseen, reflective streaked slopes. Advertisement Ceres' four-mile tall mountain is seen toward the center right of this photograph, taken by NASA's Dawn spacecraft on Aug. 19, 2015. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA \"How the mountain formed is not yet understood. It is a big -- VERY BIG -- mystery to us right now,\" Christopher Russell , the principal investigator for the Dawn mission at UCLA, told The Huffington Post in an email. Preliminary data indicates the bright, reflective material is likely a salt \"similar to the salts we see on the surface of the Earth in dry lake beds, for example,\" Russell said, though he cautioned that the ultimate chemical makeup of the salt relies on the \"chemistry of the interior of the planet.\" Advertisement \"The biggest patch of this 'salt' is in the crater Occator where the bright spots were found,\" Russell added, referring to the dwarf planet's mysterious reflective patches , which fueled plenty of conspiracy theories earlier this summer. Ceres' reflective patches are seen in this photo taken on June 6, 2015 by NASA's Dawn spacecraft. NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA Dawn will spend the next two months mapping Ceres' surface from its current elevation, according to NASA. In late October, the spacecraft will conclude its Ceres mission with a final orbit of the dwarf planet at an elevation of 230 miles, which will capture the highest resolution photos yet.

LEAVE A COMMENT By Daniel Wesley Big data: It\u2019s the topic on everyone\u2019s lips. Even high schoolers are clamoring to get into the data science field -- they realize jobs in the data sector are expected to grow more than sevenfold, totaling nearly 3 million positions by 2020. The demand for data experts is high, but will entrepreneurs be able to leverage relationships with their data scientists to create successful businesses? It\u2019s a true concern: Leaders aren\u2019t always great at communicating , and without a strong bond with their data scientists, entrepreneurs and small business leaders could find themselves unable to foster the trust necessary to reach their goals. In other words, you could find yourself with lots of data and no way to effectively relate to the person on your team who can manage it. It\u2019s like finding an antique treasure chest without the key. Sure, you could forcefully pry it open, but that risks irreparable damage. It\u2019s better to seek smooth access than court destruction and dismay. Advertisement Why Math, Science and Tech Pros Perplex If you\u2019ve spent half an hour with data scientists, you know they\u2019re smarter than smart. These are folks who look at a set of random data points and see connections. They\u2019re multifaceted and insightful. Still, they can be a frustrating lot from the viewpoint of a gregarious, sales-minded founder. The disconnect happens on numerous levels, starting with personality types. Data scientists tend to be introverts ; rather than gab incessantly, they listen and respond selectively. They need to recharge in environments where they can process life alone. This flies in the face of extroverted creative types whose missions include copious amounts of chitchat. It also makes it tough to develop relational speaking points because data scientists don\u2019t seek out the watercooler. Ironically, I\u2019m an introvert myself, but I recognize the need to balance my tendencies with a cadre of extroverted friends and colleagues. However, many data scientists are more reticent to seek out outgoing co-workers. And while most busy entrepreneurs might be able to give up a Friday happy hour once a month, data scientists aren\u2019t likely to join them for cocktails. Advertisement On the flip side of the communication conundrum, data scientists don\u2019t necessarily find the leaders of their companies any easier to comprehend. Those in the data field want to see passion flowing downward, creating a positive and energetic cultural environment that resonates with personnel. This energy motivates data workers and illustrates that they\u2019re working for a higher purpose. Data scientists also want to feel the businesses they work for are led by confident, charismatic individuals who value people, not sheeple. An owner who is narrow-minded or closed to outside ideas will destroy the golden goose. Good leaders realize innovation -- fostered by new ways of thinking about ideas and products -- enables data teams to communicate new perspectives, so they push when warranted and step back when necessary. Both leaders and data scientists want to have trust. They just have to build that trust through specific relationship-building strategies. Advertisement The Intersection Between Data Folks and Founders Want to strengthen your bond with your data scientist? The following suggestions work to create great and lasting relationships between data scientists and leaders. I should know: They\u2019re based on my relationship with a data guru-turned-president, Rob Hunter. He and I might be night and day in terms of personalities, but that\u2019s only ripened the connection we have. 1. Get personal. Immediately after hiring a data scientist, set up a time to share lunch or drinks. Focus on your one-on-one conversation and actively listen to your new employee. This opens the lines of communication organically . Don\u2019t be aggressive; let the conversation flow from one topic to another and try to discover commonalities. Rob and I did this and just clicked. He saw that I thought like a fast-moving, triage-trained doctor because of my medical background, and I recognized that he was more of a stabilizer. Best of all, we bonded while talking about our families, despite our kids\u2019 age differences -- mine were young, while his were ready for college. To this day, we still exchange small talk comfortably as friends. Advertisement 2. Understand their motivators. What drives your data scientist? As a leader, it\u2019s up to you to find out. The more you know, the more you can encourage their growth. Inquire about past projects and ask questions about how they like to operate. Determine what tools they need for efficiency and effectiveness, but don\u2019t expect an introvert to give up this information without gentle prompting. I learned early that Rob\u2019s motivations dovetailed with mine: overcoming the challenges of achieving business success. Being competitive types, we both like to win. We also both care deeply about providing for our families. We might have been in different places in our lives and had dissimilar career paths, but we could motivate each other because we understood our personal drivers. 3. Strive for relatable communication. Data scientists prefer hearing about tangible objectives, not pie-in-the-sky dreams. When you speak with data workers, be sure to explain what you want to see. As your relationship develops, figure out how to communicate your goals -- and your data scientist\u2019s results -- in a way you can both understand. Advertisement For me, everything relates to sports. Luckily, Rob\u2019s no stranger to the lingo, so when he wanted to get a point across to me, he used sports analogies. We stayed on the same page, often using references like being a quarterback or winning the Super Bowl. Every business leader is destined to work with data scientists. Not sure you\u2019re prepared to overcome the challenges inherent in developing relationships with talented data workers? Put a plan together and work at it. You\u2019ll see results and sow the seeds of sincere camaraderie. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Has A Sobering Reminder For You This Earth Day \"Save the planet\" is a misguided rallying cry. Here's why. By Rebecca Shapiro Senior Editor, HuffPost Apr 22, 2018, 06:13 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took a moment on Earth Day to remind those calling for the planet\u2019s \u201csaving\u201d to revise their message. The author, podcast host and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History tweeted the advice on Sunday. The perennial cry to \u201cSave Earth\" is odd. Planet Earth survives massive asteroid strikes -- it'll survive anything we throw at it. But Life on Earth will not. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) April 22, 2018 Advertisement His message is a familiar one (for scientists and George Carlin fans alike). But as science communications guru Aaron Huertas put it, \u201cSave the Planet\u201d has a better ring to it than the reality. Admittedly, \"Preserve the Relatively Stable Biosphere in Which Human Civilization Developed\" doesn't quite have the same ring to it. \u2014 Aaron Huertas (@aaronhuertas) April 22, 2018 But that\u2019s a start... https://t.co/ZiOUdSHQ4G \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) April 22, 2018 Advertisement Soon after, climate scientist Gavin Schmidt offered a solution: A better (and almost as pithy) slogan would be \"Save our Earth\" - the one with the current coastlines, biosphere, atmospheric composition and inhabitants. @aaronhuertas @carolynporco @AdamFrank4 https://t.co/PyHhMU3HXt \u2014 Gavin Schmidt (@ClimateOfGavin) April 22, 2018 Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Does Being Neurotic Really Make You More Creative? These psychologists say there are perks to being an overthinker. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 27, 2015, 03:30 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Alma Haser via Getty Images Neuroticism may not be so bad after all. Neurotic people tend to overthink things and dwell on negative thoughts, emotions and experiences. But as much as these tendencies make them prone to bad moods and anxiety, they can also greatly enhance creativity. Why? The link between neuroticism and creativity seems to be rooted in overthinking . A new opinion paper suggests that the part of the brain associated with self-generated thoughts -- the sort involved in both rumination and introspection -- tends to be overactive in neurotic people, leading to unhappiness as well as creative problem-solving. Advertisement \"Neuroticism has costs but it also has benefits,\" Dr. Adam Perkins, a lecturer in neurobiology of personality at King's College London and one of the paper's authors, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Highly neurotic people will suffer a lot of anxiety and depression over their lifespan, but their deep-thinking, brooding tendencies can also give rise to greater creative potential.\" In the paper , published in the September 2015 edition of the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Perkins and his colleagues present this new theory explaining the link between neuroticism and creativity. Overthinking is a hallmark of high neuroticism. Thinking too much can result from a hyperactivity to perceived threats, which can contribute to both anxiety and the capacity to solve problems creatively. Advertisement For instance, Sir Isaac Newton was notoriously neurotic , but it may have been his tendency to dwell on a problem that led him to his groundbreaking scientific advances, including his formulation of the law of gravity, according to the paper. This makes sense if you look at creativity as the ability to exercise flexibility in generating solutions to various real-world problems. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Advertisement What does this look like in the brain? The researchers noticed spontaneous high activity in areas of the brain involved in the conscious perception of threat, the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. This suggests that it's not just overthinking in general that characterizes neuroticism and creativity, but rather a particular type of overthinking -- the brain is responding to a perceived threat and going into overthinking mode to solve the problem.

New Horizons Probe Survives Pluto Flyby The spacecraft caps a 3 billion mile journey, nine years in the making. Irene Klotz Jul 14, 2015, 09:46 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LAUREL, Md., July 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. spacecraft sailed past the tiny planet Pluto in the distant reaches of the solar system on Tuesday, capping a journey of 3 billion miles (4.88 billion km) that began nine and a half years ago. NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft passed by the ice-and-rock planetoid and its entourage of five moons at 7:49 a.m. EDT (1149 GMT). The event culminated an initiative to survey the solar system that the space agency embarked upon more than 50 years ago. Advertisement \u201cPluto just had its first visitor,\u201d President Obama posted on Twitter. \u201cThanks NASA. It\u2019s a great day for discovery and American leadership.\u201d About 13 hours after its closest approach to Pluto, the last major unexplored body in the solar system, New Horizons phoned home, signaling that it had survived its 31,000 miles per hour(49,000 km per hour) blitz through the Pluto system. Managers had estimated there was a 1-in-10,000 chance a debris strike could destroy New Horizons as it soared just 7,750 miles (12,472 km) - about the distance from New York to Mumbai - from Pluto. Advertisement But right on time, New Horizons made radio contact with flight controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab outside Baltimore, sparking a wave of shouts and applause from an overflow crowd gathered to watch the drama unfold. With 99 percent of the data gathered during the encounter still on the spaceship, New Horizons\u2019 survival was critical to the mission. \u201cThis is a tremendous moment in human history,\u201d said John Grunsfeld, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for science.

Sending back its first post-flyby signal took another four-and-a-half hours, the time it takes radio signals, traveling at light speed, to travel the 3 billion miles (4.88 billion km) back to Earth. Advertisement Already, the trickle of images and measurements relayed from New Horizons before Tuesday's pass by Pluto has changed scientists' understanding of this diminutive world, which is smaller than Earth's moon. Once considered an icy, dead world, the planetoid has yielded signs of geological activity, with evidence of past and possibly present-day tectonics, or movements of its crust. \"This is clearly a world where both geology and atmosphere climatology play a role,\" said Alan Stern, New Horizons lead scientist, with the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. He noted that it appears that nitrogen and methane snow fall on Pluto. Advertisement Jim Green, NASA Planetary Science Division director, center, and other New Horizons team members count down to the spacecraft's closest approach to Pluto, Tuesday, July 14, 2015 at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. The moment of closest approach for the New Horizons spacecraft came around 7:49 a.m. EDT Tuesday, culminating an epic journey from planet Earth that spanned an incredible 3 billion miles and 9\u00c2\u00bd years. (Bill Ingalls/NASA via AP) ASSOCIATED PRESS Pluto circles the sun every 248 years in a highly tilted orbit that creates radical changes from season to season. Pluto travels closer to the sun than the orbit of Neptune before it cycles back into the solar system's deep freeze more than 40 times farther away than Earth. Scientists have many questions about Pluto, which was still considered the solar system's ninth planet when New Horizons was launched in 2006. Pluto was reclassified as a \"dwarf planet\" after the discovery of other Pluto-like spheres orbiting in the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond the eighth planet, Neptune. The objects are believed to be remnants from the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago. Advertisement \"Now the solar system will be further opened up to us, revealing the secrets of distant Pluto,\" British cosmologist Stephen Hawking said in a message broadcast on NASA TV. \"We explore because we are human and we want to know. I hope that Pluto will help us on that journey,\" Hawking said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It will take about 16 months for New Horizons to transmit back all the thousands of images and measurements taken during its pass by Pluto. By then, the spacecraft will have traveled even deeper into the Kuiper Belt, heading for a possible follow-on mission to one of Pluto's cousins.

You Might As Well Flip A Coin To Fill In Your NCAA Brackets, Researcher Says You Might As Well Flip A Coin To Fill In Your NCAA Brackets By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Mar 14, 2015, 10:27 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT ARLINGTON, TX - APRIL 07: DeAndre Daniels #2 of the Connecticut Huskies drives to the basket against the Kentucky Wildcats during the NCAA Men's Final Four Championship at AT&T Stadium on April 7, 2014 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) Hey, basketball pundits, here's something about March Madness that could make you really mad. Flipping a coin to fill in your NCAA Tournament brackets may yield better results than making selections based on your personal assessment of the teams, a University of Michigan professor says. \"You have to realize that there's a level of chance that comes into play even though we consider sports betting a skill-based gaming,\" Dr. Dae Hee Kwak, an assistant professor of sport management, told The Huffington Post. Advertisement Now before any fan surrenders all hope ahead of the brackets announcement on Sunday, Kwak is basing his theory on a single instance: the 2011 NCAA Tournament. It happened to be a year in which no top seed made the Final Four. He also assigned more value to picks in the later rounds. For his informal study, Kwak invited 200 Michigan students and alumni to fill out brackets to the best of their ability while he picked winners for three separate bracket sheets based on coin flips. The coin-flip brackets outperformed the average score of the participants, he found. What do others make of the theory? One mathematician said sports knowledge can provide an edge. Dr. Jordan Ellenberg, a math professor at the University of Wisconsin, pointed to a coin-flip statistic for last year's tournament that he said showed \"coin-flip brackets do REALLY REALLY BADLY relative to the median ESPN Tournament Challenge player, who is presumably using their basketball knowledge and trying to win.\" Advertisement The bottom line? Knowledgeable or not, players have a tough time achieving a high rate of accuracy. Despite Warren Buffett's $1 billion prize to anyone who could correctly pick all 63 games last year, the best player in the ESPN pools fell 18 games short, according to Michigan News. But that won't stop millions from coming back for more. Another study by Kwak , \"The Overestimation Phenomenon in a Skill-Based Gaming Context: The Case of March Madness Pools,\" was recently published in the Journal of Gambling Studies. It explains why we're such gluttons for March Madness punishment. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Gamblers who expressed high confidence in their bracket success performed the same on average as those expressing low confidence, Kwak said, but it was the self-assurance that kept them betting year after year.

Octopus Valentine's Day Sex Session Scrapped Over Cannibalism Fears The Seattle Aquarium said the 70-pound cephalopod could end up eating rather than mating with the smaller octopus. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 15, 2016, 06:22 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Poor Kong. The Seattle Aquarium's octopus was due to spend Valentine's Day having sex, b ut the mating session was canceled over concerns he'd make his female companion his lunch rather than his lover, KOMO reported. Staff said the 70-pound Kong was way too big for his fellow female cephalopods plucked from the sea, who tipped the scales at just 30 to 40 pounds each. Worried he'd end up eating them, the staff scrapped the popular event and Kong was joined in his tank by a diver instead. Advertisement \" We've never seen an animal that was ready to mate that was smaller than 35 pounds,\" Tim Carpenter, the aquarium's curator of fish and invertebrates, explained to CrossCut.com. \"Beyond that, we won't even bother.\" Giant Pacific octopuses like Kong live between three to five years and grow to around 90 pounds, according to the aquarium's website . Dubbed \" terminal breeders ,\" t hey start looking for sex towards the end of their lives. Males die soon after doing the deed. Giant Pacific octopuses, such as the one pictured, start looking for sex shortly before the end of their lives. antos777 via Getty Images Advertisement Females lay eggs and tend to them, but they don't eat and waste away , usually dying once their offspring hatch. The aquarium's Valentine's Day octopus \"Blind Date\" has been held annually for 10 years. According to CrossCut.com, the 8-legged creatures are collected from the Puget Sound inlet. Whether they actually mate, or just ignore each other, is pretty much the luck of the draw. \"A blind date is a blind date, and you never know how it's going to go,\" said Carpenter. Kong's exact age is not known. He'll be released back into the Puget Sound on Monday, Regional News Network reported.

Humongous Sunfish Dwarfs Divers As scary as it may appear, the gargantuan creature poses no threat to humans. By Whitney Meers Trends Writer, The Huffington Post Oct 16, 2015, 08:44 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT When fishermen talk about the one that got away they just may be talking about this giant sunfish. The September 2013 encounter, which just started to go viral recently, documents a sighting of a Mola mola off the coast of Azores, Portugal. This species is found in tropical and temperate oceans and weighs an average of 2,200 pounds -- nearly as much as a Toyota Yaris. The largest Mola mola on record weighed a whopping 5,071 pounds , according to Ocean Sunfish. Advertisement \"The Sunfish seemed not to be bothered by our presence at all and followed us for 15 minutes,\" ViralHog quotes videographer Miguel Pereira. Advertisement \"Mola\" is the Latin word for millstone , a nod to the fish's rounded shape. As scary as this creature appears to be, it poses no threat to humans. It subsists on jellyfish and crustaceans.

NASA Has High Hopes For Powerful New Telescope The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope is meant to solve the mysteries of dark energy and seek out distant planets. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 19, 2016, 02:34 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT There's a new telescope on the horizon -- and it's huge. NASA is planning to launch the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope , or WFIRST, in the mid-2020s. The telescope has a primary mirror that is 7.9 feet in diameter and will offer a view of the sky that is 100 times larger than what the Hubble Space Telescope provides. The space agency released the new video above on Thursday to detail its ambitious plans for the telescope, which is meant to discover new exoplanets, unlock the secrets of dark energy and shed new light on the evolution of the cosmos. Advertisement \"Telescopes generally come into two different flavors,\" Jason Kalirai, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, says in the video. \"You have really powerful, big telescopes, but those telescopes see a tiny part of the sky. Or telescopes are smaller, and so they lack that power, but they can see big parts of the sky. WFIRST is the best of both worlds.\" NASA officials had not been expecting to go forward with WFIRST mission plans until 2017 at the earliest, Science magazine reported. But since the agency's Program Management Council decided to move ahead on Wednesday, officials can now start creating a formal schedule for the six-year mission , which is estimated to cost between $2 billion to $2.3 billion , according to Space.com. WFIRST is currently headquartered at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Advertisement \"WFIRST has the potential to open our eyes to the wonders of the universe, much the same way Hubble has,\" John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement .

UVA Discovers Hidden Chemistry Lab Thomas Jefferson Designed \"This may be the oldest intact example of early chemical education in this country.\" By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Oct 16, 2015, 03:58 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Construction workers at the University of Virginia have discovered a hidden chemistry laboratory that school officials say is likely linked to former President Thomas Jefferson. Renovations to the Rotunda, a UVA building Jefferson designed in the 1820s, revealed a chemical hearth had been hidden behind a wall, according to the university. Workers uncovered the room on Monday. Advertisement Officials say the hearth may have been designed for John Emmet, the school's first professor of natural history, to use along with a nearby classroom. \"This may be the oldest intact example of early chemical education in this country,\" Brian Hogg, the university's senior historic preservation planner, said in a news release. The hearth discovered in the Rotunda at the University of Virginia. Dan Addison Advertisement Science students used the five workspaces in the primitive lab setting to perform chemical experiments, the release said. Like a modern lab, the hearth contained heat sources and a ventilation system to remove fumes. The hearth was walled off in 1850 and survived a major fire that destroyed a large portion of the building in 1895, according to the university. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Take A Rare Look At 'World's Biggest Heart' It's \"the size of maybe a small golf cart.\" By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Aug 25, 2015, 04:54 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The blue whale has a lot of heart. Thought to be the biggest animal to ever inhabit the Earth, the creature would presumably have an impressive ticker, too. But this has been a guessing game because preserved blue whale hearts are rare, according to a new series called \"Big Blue Live,\" airing on PBS in the U.S. and BBC in the U.K. Advertisement In a teaser posted to YouTube , a technician from The Royal Ontario Museum shows off what is believed to be one of the few blue whale hearts ever preserved. It weighs nearly 400 pounds and its dimensions are 5 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet. It's \"the world's biggest heart ,\" according to the BBC. The museum got the sample from a dead 76-foot blue whale that washed ashore in Newfoundland after it got trapped in ice, the BBC reported. The find has verified that some of science's best guesses about the blue whale haven't been so exact. Advertisement \"I was expecting something the size of a car, but found a heart more like the size of maybe a small golf cart or circus bumper car for two,\" Jacqueline Miller, a mammalogy technician at the museum, told the BBC. National Geographic's website has this to say about blue whales : \"Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.\" Time to update.

Hundreds Of Coastal Communities Could Face Monthly Floods In The Coming Decades \"If we fail to limit warming, we\u2019re committing a great many people to a future of flooding and inundation.\" By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 12, 2017, 09:46 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Mary Calvert / Reuters Nearly 670 coastal areas in America could face monthly bouts of flooding by the end of this century, including more than 60 percent of communities along the East and Gulf coasts, according to a study released Wednesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists . The analysis , published in the peer-reviewed journal Elementa, is the first to examine the threat of chronic flooding to the entire coastline of the lower 48 states. The term is used for areas where 10 percent of a community\u2019s land is flooded at least 26 times per year, or an average of once every other week. Advertisement The report looks at three possible scenarios in the coming decades as the world works to tackle the growing threat of climate change. The \u201clow scenario\u201d assumes a steep decline in carbon emissions in line with the landmark Paris climate agreement , which seeks to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The \u201cintermediate scenario\u201d has emissions peaking at mid-century, which would result in around 4 feet of sea level rise. And the \u201chigh scenario\u201d assumes emissions will rise through 2100, which would spur rapid ice melt around the globe and lead to at least 6.5 feet of sea level rise. In the middle scenario, about 170 communities would be affected by chronic flooding in less than 20 years. By 2060 that number would rise to 270, and by 2100 it would be at 490, affecting coastal communities around America. The high scenario would only make things worse in many more places, leading to the 670 figure mentioned above. UCS released an interactive map showing the expected effects of each scenario. (The map may take a few seconds to load.) Advertisement The threats described in the study are already being felt in dozens of communities around the country, according to Erika Spanger-Siegfried , an author of the report and a senior analyst in the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. \u201cSome 90 communities, mostly in Louisiana and Maryland where the land is also sinking, are already facing chronic inundation from sea level rise,\u201d Spanger-Siegfried said in a statement. \u201cAs global temperature increases sea level rise, several hundred coastal communities are looking at the same kind of chronic flooding around the middle of the century \u2015 from beach vacation destinations like the Jersey Shore and the Gulf Coast of Florida to larger cities, including Boston, Galveston, Savannah and Fort Lauderdale. By late century, four of the five boroughs of New York City would be chronically inundated.\u201d Advertisement Meanwhile, under President Donald Trump , the U.S. has taken steps to increase its reliance on fossil fuels and withdraw from its international climate commitments. The White House has announced a rollback of many of the previous administration\u2019s climate policies , and Trump said last month that he would formally remove America from the Paris Agreement , which seeks to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Sea level rise is directly linked to climate change , with the planet\u2019s ice sheets melting at unprecedented rates due to our warming world. Surging waters threaten millions of Americans, dozens of the world\u2019s biggest cities and an untold number of coastal assets. Almost every other nation on the planet has vowed to dramatically reduce emissions in an effort to mitigate the threat, and every leader of the G-20 group except Trump pledged to move forward on climate change last week with or without the U.S. (although the country is the world\u2019s second largest carbon emitter). Advertisement UCS\u2019 report mirrors another released earlier this year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on the final day of President Barack Obama \u2019s presidency. That study found sea levels could rise by more than 8 feet by the end of the century \u2015 one of the highest federal estimates ever, and more than a foot and a half higher than the UCS estimate \u2015 if emissions are not curbed and the planet sees an \u201cextreme\u201d level of climate change. An analysis by the group Climate Central found that millions of Americans in some of the country\u2019s most populous cities would be affected under NOAA\u2019s worst scenario, which would bring tides 2 feet higher than those seen during Hurricane Sandy to parts of New York City. One of Trump\u2019s flagship properties, the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, could very well be mostly underwater by 2100 due to climate change-induced sea level rise. Advertisement The president may not see sea level rise as a threat, however. In June, he told the mayor of Virginia\u2019s Tangier Island \u201c not to worry about \u201d the phenomenon, according to the mayor. UCS mentions several strategies to curb the effects of sea level rise in its report, but the study\u2019s authors say the country has \u201ca clear choice\u201d ahead: Advertisement At this crossroads, reducing global warming emissions must be a national priority. The United States can still make deep cuts in heat-trapping emissions, thereby contributing to global efforts to limit climate change. We are at a turning point where we can still avoid some of the most serious human consequences and losses that our coasts \u2015 and indeed coastal communities around the world \u2015 face this century. We have time to respond. We must use it wisely. Rachel Cleetus, the lead economist and climate police manager at UCS, said the best way to sidestep catastrophe would be to abide by the terms of the Paris accord. This is something the president seems unlikely to do, although other U.S. politicians have stepped up in his stead . \u201cMeeting the long term goals of the Paris Agreement would offer coastal communities facing chronic flooding their best chance to limit the harms of sea level rise,\u201d Cleetus said in a statement. \u201cDespite President Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine near-term federal action on climate change, other countries as well as U.S. states, cities, businesses and citizens are showing firm resolve to fulfill the promise of Paris. They understand that if we fail to limit warming, we\u2019re committing a great many people to a future of flooding and inundation, and the hard choices and significant costs that come with it.\u201d Advertisement CORRECTION : An earlier version of this article misstated that Tangier Island was part of Maryland.

Bill Nye's Take On Whether Being Gay Makes Evolutionary Sense The Science Guy doesn't always have the answers, but he does have good advice. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 14, 2015, 05:43 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT When you were a kid, did it seem like Bill Nye had all the answers? Turns out \u201cThe Science Guy\u201d is a still a great dude to go to with questions. On last week\u2019s episode of Big Think\u2019s web series \u201cTuesdays with Bill,\u201d the bowtie-clad scientist responded to a reader\u2019s question about whether being gay makes evolutionary sense. Watch the episode and read the full transcript here. The viewer wrote: If the purpose of a species is to reproduce and survive, how would it make sense evolutionarily for humans to have same-sex preferences? Are humans the only ones who practice homosexuality? And if so does this mean that homosexuality is a product of human\u2019s personal whim as opposed to instinct? Nye notes that he\u2019s \u201cnot an authority\u201d on the subject, but points out that homosexuality has been documented among chimps and Bonobos. Advertisement He doesn\u2019t get into the nitty-gritty on whether homosexuality makes \u201csense\u201d evolutionary, but instead seems to come to the conclusion that the question isn\u2019t that important -- at least when it comes to how we treat other people. \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate being alive, everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cApparently it\u2019s something that happens in nature and look, we\u2019re all here.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

There is scientific support for the idea that homosexuality has an evolutionary basis. Italian researchers found that the mothers and maternal aunts of gay men tend to have more children than other women. They theorize that the same gene that that might promote homosexuality in men may also promote fertility in women and make them more attractive to men. Advertisement Contact the author.

Eastern Monarch Butterflies May Be At Risk Of Extinction Within 20 Years Though the population was up this winter, the winged insects aren't out of the woods yet. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Mar 26, 2016, 04:31 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Vstock LLC via Getty Images North America\u2019s eastern monarch butterflies may still be at risk of extinction , despite recent increases in their population. The population of eastern monarchs has declined 84 percent from the winter of 1996-1997 to the winter of 2014-2015, according to a Scripps Institution of Oceanography study. ( Western monarch butterflies , which live west of the Rocky Mountains and migrate to California, were not included in the study. However, other studies indicate they are experiencing population declines of their own .) Advertisement This long-term decline means there is a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d that monarchs become \u201cquasi-extinct\u201d within the next 20 years, researchers wrote in the study, published Monday in in the journal Scientific Reports . This means that a species is not yet extinct, but has so few individuals that it\u2019s impossible for the population to recover. Because it\u2019s somewhat impractical to count individual monarchs, scientists count the population by measuring the geographic area that the insects take up while spending the winter in Mexico . Monarch butterflies on a forest floor in Mexico. David E Myers via Getty Images Advertisement The recorded eastern monarch population hit an all-time low in the winter of 2013-2014, covering only 1.7 acres of land while wintering in Mexico. Conservation efforts have led to massive population booms -- this winter the butterflies covered 10 acres -- but the improvements aren\u2019t enough to offset long term declines. In the winter of 1996, monarchs covered nearly 45 acres. Scientists attribute their dramatic population decline since then to multiple factors, including loss of breeding habitat, change and deforestation, according to the World Wildlife Fund. For monarchs, loss of breeding habitat -- which the researchers believe is the primary factor in their decline -- means a loss of milkweed. The butterflies lay eggs on milkweed, and it\u2019s the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. Advertisement Ecologist John Pleasants told Vox that he estimates the United States has lost more than 1 billion milkweed plants since the 1990s, and continues to lose around 2 million a year due to factors like the widespread use of herbicides and farmers converting grassland to cropland. That means that while recent conservation efforts like planting milkweed in gardens and strips of highways have been helpful, they aren\u2019t nearly enough to recover the massive amounts that have disappeared from the U.S.' agricultural land.

Vox details several possible solutions to the issue , including a proposed Environmental Defense Fund initiative nicknamed the \u201c airnbnb for butterflies .\u201d This program would allow investors to pay farms and other landowners to set aside substantial protected spaces filled with milkweed. Advertisement This type of effort seems to be in line with what the Scripps scientists recommend. \u201cPreviously published research suggested that the most effective way to increase monarch numbers is to focus on the restoration of their breeding habitat,\u201d said co-author Darius Semmens in a statement. \u201cOver the previous two winters, eastern monarch populations were very low, indicating a higher risk of losing the species.

We Now Know How Tiny Lizards Defy Gravity With Their Gargantuan Tongues Evolution gave these little guys one of most explosive movements in the entire animal kingdom -- and it's terrifying. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 4, 2016, 09:28 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A certain pygmy chameleon can achieve one of the most explosive movements in the animal kingdom , and now scientists know the secret to its power. The endangered rosette-nosed chameleon , or Rhampholeon spinosus, is capable of flinging its tongue 2.5 times the length of its own body and from zero to 60 miles per hour in a hundredth of a second -- that's 300 times faster than a 2015 Chevrolet Corvette accelerates. This tiny lizard species, which is found only in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania, measures just a couple of inches in length. But a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports on Monday reveals exactly how the small creature makes up in powerful tongue speed what it lacks in size. Advertisement The tiny Rhampholeon spinosus chameleon can stick out its tongue with a peak acceleration 264 times greater than the acceleration due to gravity. Christopher Anderson/Brown University For the study, Brown University biologist Christopher Anderson and his team surveyed 20 chameleon species of varying sizes in an attempt to find the upper limit of chameleon tongue performance. Research shows that a chameleon's secret weapon is its ability to \"pre-load\" large amounts of energy into the tongue's elastic tissue, and this stored energy augments the muscle power used to fling the tongue. And while all chameleons have the same catapult-like apparatus for launching the tongue, smaller chameleons have ones that are larger proportional to their size. Advertisement \u201cSmaller species have higher performance than larger species,\u201d Anderson said in a statement. He compared the smaller species to \" little sports cars with relatively powerful engines.\" The researchers concluded that it's an evolutionary trait that can be explained by a smaller animal's need to \" consume more energy per body weight \" in order to survive. Just check out the Trioceros hoehnelii -- one of the chameleon species used in the study -- below. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

With a peak acceleration 264 times greater than the force of gravity, the rosette-nosed chameleon's tongue has the \"highest acceleration and power output produced per kilogram of muscle mass by any reptile, bird, or mammal\" -- second only to a salamander, which has the most powerful tongue of all vertebrates, according to the researchers.

Stripped-Down Synthetic Organism Has Smallest Genome Yet It has only 473 genes, and many of them are a complete mystery. Will Dunham Mar 25, 2016, 10:41 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Scientists on Thursday announced the creation of a synthetic organism stripped down to the bare essentials with the fewest genes needed to survive and multiply, a feat at the microscopic level that may provide big insights on the very nature of life. Genome research pioneer J. Craig Venter called the bacterial cell his research team designed and constructed the \"most simple of all organisms.\" While the human genome possesses more than 20,000 genes, the new organism gets by with only 473. Advertisement \"This study is definitely trying to understand a minimal basis of life,\" said Venter. But the researchers said that even with such a simple organism, that understanding remained elusive. They noted that even though their organism has so few genes, they were still uncertain about the function of nearly a third of them, even after more than five years of work. The researchers predicted their work would yield practical applications in developing new medicines, biochemicals, biofuels and in agriculture. Advertisement \"Our long-term vision has been to design and build synthetic organisms on demand where you can add in specific functions and predict what the outcome is going to be,\" said Daniel Gibson, vice president for DNA technologies at Synthetic Genomics Inc, the company handling commercial applications from the research. \"I think it's the start of a new era,\" Venter added. Venter helped map the human genome in 2001 and created the first synthetic cell in 2010 with the same team that conducted the new research. That 2010 achievement, creating a bacterial organism with a manmade genome, demonstrated that genomes can be designed on a computer, made in a laboratory and transplanted into a cell to form a new, self-replicating organism. Advertisement Having created that synthetic cell, the researchers set out to engineer a bacterium by removing unessential genes. The goal was to use the fewest genes necessary for the organism to live and reproduce. Venter said initially \"every one of our designs failed\" because they took out too many genes, and had to restore some. ORCHESTRA, NOT PICCOLO PLAYER Venter said one lesson was that to understand life, it is more important to look across the entirely of a genome, an organism's complete genetic blueprint, rather than at individual genes. Advertisement \"Life is much more like a symphony orchestra than a piccolo player. And we're applying the same philosophy now to our analysis of the human genome, where we're finding most human conditions are affected by variations across the entire genome\" rather than a single gene, Venter said. The researchers said they created a minimal cell possessing the smallest genome of any self-replicating organism. They said a cell with even fewer genes could be possible although it might, for example, reproduce excruciatingly slowly. Microbiologist Clyde Hutchison of the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla California, lead author of the study in the journal Science, said the goal is to figure out the functions of all the cell's genes and make a computer model to predict how it would grow and change in different environments or with additional genes. Advertisement \"It's important to realize there is no cell that exists where we know the functions of all the genes,\" Hutchison said. The environmental group Friends of the Earth expressed concern about the research, citing the lack of government regulations specific to synthetic biology and gene editing technologies. \"Living organisms like bacteria are not machines to be rewired,\" said Dana Perls, an official of the group. \"Not even the scientists know the biological function of 149 of these genes, which raises safety concerns. If we don't fully understand the science, it is more difficult to manage biosafety concerns.\" Advertisement The research might shed light on the origins of life on Earth billions of years ago. \"We may be getting hints of some early fundamental mechanisms that coincide with some of the most primitive kind of life forms,\" Venter said. \"I think as we get the ability to explore further in the universe, my view is wherever we have the same chemical constituents, which is almost everywhere, life will happen,\" Venter said. \"But that's a philosophical point until it's proven.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Want To Turn Guantanamo Bay Into A Research Park But for Gitmo to go green, Cuba needs to be on board. By Casey Williams On assignment for HuffPost Mar 25, 2016, 07:20 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT RHONA WISE via Getty Images In the wake of President Barack Obama 's historic visit to Cuba , questions remain about America's changing relationship with the island nation. Chief among those: What will happen to Guantanamo Bay? The question has become a sticking point in negotiations between the two countries. For Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro, returning Guantanamo Bay to Cuba is a sine qua non for a full rapprochement. Advertisement \"In order to move forward towards normalization, it will also be necessary to return the territory illegally occupied by Guantanamo Naval Base,\" Castro told reporters in a press conference with Obama on Monday, according to Time magazine. For its part, the U.S. has made it clear that returning Guantanamo is not up for discussion, at least for now. But scientists have proposed a third option for the land : turn Guantanamo Bay into a protected area for environmental research. Coral reef off the coast of Cuba. Noel Lopez Fernandez Advertisement Joe Roman, a fellow at the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics at the University of Vermont, had the idea while traveling in Cuba last summer. \"I was trying to think of a future that could be pretty inspirational,\" Roman told The Huffington Post about his proposal for the research facility. With James Kraska, a law professor at the Naval War College, Roman published an article in the journal Science last week proposing to convert the 45-square-mile section of Cuba's coast into a protected area for research on climate change and biodiversity. Converting the land into a park would allow scientists to conduct important studies, protect some of Cuba's well-preserved ecosystems and improve diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Cuba. Advertisement \"We could confront one of biggest issues of 21st century -- climate change and biodiversity loss,\" Roman said. The U.S. has controlled Guantanamo Bay since 1903 . The U.S. Navy technically leases the land from the Cuban government -- at around $4,000 a year. But since the 1960s, Cuba has refused to cash the rent checks, arguing that the U.S. occupation is illegitimate. \u201cOne way to return the land and improve diplomacy would be to convert the area into a research center that would host both American and Cuban researchers.\"\u201d - Joe Roman, Conservation biologist Advertisement Obama has vowed to close the base's infamous detention center, which holds prisoners taken captive in the war on terror, but he won't return the land occupied by the naval base. That could make it politically difficult to transform the base into a research park, said Jonathan Hansen, a Harvard historian and author of Guant\u00e1namo: An American History . \"Cubans would go totally nuts if [the U.S. government] is taking their base away and sticking a research facility there,\" Hansen told HuffPost. While the Cuban government would likely oppose a park run by the U.S., a research facility co-managed by the U.S. and Cuba might work, Hansen said. Advertisement \"That kind of talk is real, since [Cubans] see themselves as leaders in science and medicine,\" Hansen said. \"Those are the kinds of projects for which there\u2019s a lot of goodwill in both Cuba and the U.S.\" Even if a research park would initially have to be managed by the U.S., putting a civilian research facility on the island could improve U.S.-Cuba relations and begin the process of returning Guantanamo to Cuba, according to Roman. \"The eventual goal is to return the land to Cuba,\" Roman said. \"One way to return the land and improve diplomacy would be to convert the area into a research center that would host both American and Cuban researchers.\" Advertisement Right now, Roman and Kraska's proposal remains a vision, a rough sketch of a grand idea. But conservation seems to be a major point of agreement between Cuba and the U.S. Since normalization officially began in December 2014, two of the four agreements signed by U.S. and Cuban officials have addressed environmental conservation. In the end, however, the U.S. will have to return full control of Guantanamo to Cuba, Hansen said, adding, \"W e won\u2019t have good relations with Cuba if we hold on to [Guantanamo].\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The (Paradoxical) Wisdom of Solomon The results were clear and a bit surprising. Contrary to the commonly held view that experience brings wisdom, older and younger adults in this study were indistinguishable in their wise reasoning--at least about personal conflicts. By Wray Herbert, Contributor Author, 'On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits' Author, 'On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits' Mar 14, 2015, 05:38 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

King Solomon, the third leader of the Jewish Kingdom, is considered the paragon of wisdom and sage judgment. It's said that during his long reign, people traveled great distances to seek his counsel. Yet it's also true--and much less well known--that his personal life was a shambles of bad decisions and uncontrolled passions. He kept hundreds of pagan wives and concubines, and also loved money and boasted of his riches. He neglected to instruct his only son, who grew up to be an incompetent tyrant. All these sins and misjudgments contributed to the eventual demise of the kingdom. University of Waterloo psychological scientist Igor Grossmann has been studying the nature of human wisdom, and he uses this story to illustrate what he calls Solomon's paradox. It appears that people often reason more wisely about other people's social problems than about their own, though it's not clear why this would be, or what can be done to enhance wise reasoning in the personal realm. Grossmann has been trying to answer these questions, and he described some of his ongoing work this week at the first International Convention of Psychological Science in Amsterdam. Grossmann defines wisdom as pragmatic reasoning that helps people navigate life's challenges. Such wise reasoning requires transcending one's egocentric point of view. This means recognizing the limits of one's own knowledge, acknowledging others' perspectives, and seeing circumstances in flux--all of which allow for more complex understanding of social situations. Grossmann wanted to explore the apparent asymmetry in wise reasoning. He also wanted to see if aging leads naturally to wiser reasoning--as is often assumed--and how wisdom might be enhanced in everyday experience. Advertisement He first wanted to establish that Solomon's paradox is indeed a common habit of mind. He recruited volunteers who were in long-term romantic relationships, and asked some of them to vividly ponder a situation in which their partner cheated on them. The others thought about their best friend's partner cheating on the friend. Grossmann then asked all the volunteers to reason about how their relationship (or their friend's) would unfold in the future. They also answered a dozen or so questions intended to measure wise reasoning: Do you need more information and context to really understand this situation? Is it important to you to look for a compromise? How much do you consider others' perspectives on the event? How many different futures can you imagine? And so forth. Grossmann expected that subjects would show greater wisdom when reasoning about their friend's situation than when reasoning about their own, because they would have more psychological distance from the cheating and betrayal. And that's just what they found. Having established a prevalent asymmetry in wise reasoning, Grossmann wanted to see if it's possible to avoid egocentric reasoning. Since wise reasoning appears linked to psychological distance, he suspected that deliberately distancing oneself might be tonic. To test this, he again used the infidelity scenario, and again some pondered their own partner cheating, and some a friend's. But this time, half of each group were told to reason from a first-person perspective--to close their eyes and totally immerse themselves in the experience of being betrayed. Whether it was their own experience or their friend's, they asked themselves: Why am I feeling this way? What are my thoughts and feelings? Other subjects were told to distance themselves from the event by taking a third-person perspective, even when referring to the self: Why does he or she feel this way? Advertisement As expected, self-distancing reduced the asymmetry in wise reasoning. Those who distanced themselves from their own experience of betrayal--these subjects reasoned more wisely about relationship conflicts than did those who were immersed in their own feelings. Indeed, those who distanced themselves from their own experience were indistinguishable from those who were pondering a friend's situation. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Grossmann explored this in yet another experiment, much like the self-distancing study. He recruited both old (60 to 80) and young (20 to 40) volunteers, and asked them to reason about a different kind of personal dilemma--in this case one involving not infidelity but betrayal by a friend or family member. As before, the volunteers pondered their own or someone else's experience and answered questions to assess their wise reasoning about the situation. The results were clear and a bit surprising. Contrary to the commonly held view that experience brings wisdom, older and younger adults in this study were indistinguishable in their wise reasoning--at least about personal conflicts. Older subjects were just as vulnerable to Solomon's paradoxical reasoning, and they were just as likely to become wiser if they practiced self-distancing. So wisdom does not simply accompany years of experience, but it appears to remain malleable even in older age.

By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 26, 2016, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Laughter really is contagious, scientists say. Purestock via Getty Images Certain behaviors -- like laughing and yawning -- can be easier to catch than the cold that's going around your office, according to psychologists. \"Behavioral contagion\" is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology. Our brains are hardwired for social interaction and bonding. Mimicking the actions we see in those around us is a natural way that we empathize and gain a sense of how others are feeling. Advertisement Here's a sampling of some of the behaviors that we might \"catch\" from our friends or coworkers. Perhaps the best-known contagious behavior is yawning -- even dogs can catch yawns from their owners. Contagious yawning is a sign of empathy and a form of social bonding. Risk-Taking This may explain how groups of teenage boys can do such stupid things: Risky behavior is contagious. A new study conducted by neuroscientists at the California Institute of Technology finds that after we witness others engaging in financially risky behavior -- such as making bets in a gambling scenario -- we in turn are more likely to take similar risks. (Investors, take note!) Advertisement \"Primarily, our findings advance our understanding in how our own risk-taking behavior can be influenced through passively observing other agents,\" Shinsuke Suzuki, a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at the institute and a co-author of the study, told LiveScience . Yawning Perhaps the best-known contagious behavior is yawning -- even dogs can catch yawns from their owners. Contagious yawning is a sign of empathy and a form of social bonding. But there's one type of person who seems to be completely immune to the contagion effect of yawning. A study last year found that psychopaths , whose personalities are marked by the inability to feel empathy, don't \"catch\" yawns like the rest of us. Advertisement Laughing If you've ever been to a laughter yoga class , you know that laughing can be highly contagious. Now, science has confirmed what many of us know well from experience: Your brain responds to the sound of laughter and automatically acts to join in -- even if you didn't hear the joke or weren't a part of the conversation. \"It seems that it's absolutely true that 'laugh and the whole world laughs with you,'\" Sophie Scott, a neuroscientist at the University College London and one of the study's authors, told LiveScience . \"We've known for some time that when we are talking to someone, we often mirror their behavior, copying the words they use and mimicking their gestures. Now we've shown that the same appears to apply to laughter, too -- at least at the level of the brain.\" Smiling It's said that when you smile, the whole world smiles with you -- and psychologists have shown that this common cliche contains a kernel of truth. Advertisement Research has found that when we're with a person and they smile, we're likely to \"try on\" that facial expression to get a sense of how they're feeling. This natural phenomenon of facial mimicry allows us to not only empathize with others but to actually experience their emotions for ourselves. Frowning The same instinct that leads us to smile when others do also gives us the impulse to turn down the corners of our mouths when we see someone else frown. Advertisement Yep, facial mimicry applies to frowns too (and even grimaces!). You may not necessarily form a full frown in response to someone else, but there's a good chance that your facial movements will move slightly in that direction. Workplace Rudeness Unfortunately, it's not just positive behaviors that are catching. Being impolite to your coworkers can also lead them to behave the same way. A 2015 study from the University of Florida , published in the journal Applied Psychology, found that when people encounter rude behavior at work, they're more likely to perceive rudeness in future workplace interactions, and in turn to respond rudely themselves. Advertisement \u201cPart of the problem is that we are generally tolerant of these behaviors, but they\u2019re actually really harmful,\u201d Trevor Foulk, a doctoral student and the study's lead author, said in a statement . \u201cRudeness has an incredibly powerful negative effect on the workplace.\u201d Shivering Just looking at a person who's cold can be enough to make you feel chilly too, according to research. A study from neuropsychiatrists at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, published last year in the journal PLOS One , found evidence for \"temperature contagion.\" The study suggests that when participants watched a video of a person's hand being plunged into freezing water, the temperature of their hands dropped, too. The more empathetic the participants rated themselves to be, the greater the temperature drop they experienced. Advertisement Feeling warm, unfortunately, does not seem to have the same effect.

New 'Molecule-Making Machine' Could Speed The Development Of Life-Saving Drugs Chemists Create Amazing 'Molecule-Making Machine' By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 14, 2015, 10:23 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Thanks to advances in 3-D printing, it's now possible to whip up everything from pizza to prosthetics to human organs with the push of a button . Now researchers have created a 3-D printer that works on the atomic scale, assembling complex molecules from scratch. And they say their molecule-making machine could revolutionize the drug-development process and simplify the fabrication of solar cells and other high-tech products. Advertisement A drug discovery revolution? \"We're really excited about the immediate impacts that this will have on drug discovery,\" Dr. Martin D. Burke, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign and one of the researchers, says in a video released by the university (see above). The traditional way of synthesizing small molecules requires a step-by-step series of chemical reactions--a process that is time-consuming and which requires enormous expertise. \"Small molecules have already had a big impact on the world, but we've barely touched the surface of what they're capable of achieving,\" he said in a written statement. \u201cA lot of great medicines have not been discovered yet because of this synthesis bottleneck.\" Advertisement The new printer simplifies the molecule-making process and makes it accessible to non-chemists. \"When you put the power to manufacture into the hands of everyone, history speaks toward tremendous impact,\" Burke said in the statement. \"A 3-D printer for molecules could allow us to harness all the creativity, innovation, and outside-the-box thinking that comes when non-experts start to use technology that used to only be in the hands of a select few.\" How it works. To create the machine, Burke and his collaborators analyzed the structures of thousands of molecules and identified the chemical \"building blocks\" shared by a large majority of them. The machine essentially snaps these building blocks together like LEGOs and then washes away the byproducts , Popular Mechanics reported. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Earth Changed In 2015: The View From Far Above From raging forest fires to dwindling snowmelt to the extraordinary birth of new ocean islands. Yale Environment 360 Jan 4, 2016, 05:44 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Sometimes the best way to witness planetary happenings \u2014 and to gain perspective on them \u2014 is from high above. Below are satellite images and aerial photos from the NASA Earth Observatory that capture some of the more dramatic changes that shaped the earth over the past year. Large rivers run atop the Greenland ice sheet NASA This aerial photo captured in July shows large, fast-flowing rivers on top of the Greenland ice sheet abruptly dropping into a seemingly bottomless moulin, or sinkhole, in the ice. The shifting network of streams and rivers that form during the summer melt season can transport water from the surface of the ice to the ocean, gradually eating away the frozen mass. A slew of recent research has shown that the Greenland ice sheet, composed of some of the planet's largest glaciers, is steadily losing more ice in the summer than it gains in the winter. Advertisement Man-made fires blanket Indonesia NASA This late-September NASA satellite image shows the massive plumes of smoke blanketing Sumatra, Indonesia, as peat fires burned uncontrolled. This was a record year for fires in Indonesia, and tens of thousands of infernos released clouds of particulate matter and toxic gases over the region \u2014 a process that repeats itself year after year as property owners clear their land of debris for farming. [Read more: As Indonesia Burns, Its Government Moves To Increase Forest Destruction ] A town is buried NASA Advertisement The Nepali village of Langtang, which was located along a popular trekking route near the base of Mount Langtang, was completely buried by an avalanche this spring. The ice and rocks were shaken loose by the devastating earthquake that struck central Nepal on April 25, 2015. A island is born NASA Two years ago, a new volcanic island (barely visible in the left image) broke through the waters of the western Pacific roughly 600 miles south of Tokyo and just a quarter of a mile southeast of Nishinoshima, an existing volcanic island. Over the past two years, the new island grew quickly and swallowed up its neighbor. The merged island, which is keeping the name Nishinoshima, is now 12 times the size of the original. Advertisement Toxic mining waste spews into Brazilian river NASA On November 5, 2015, the dam securing a tailings pond failed at an iron mine in southeastern Brazil. The dam break sent water and sediment contaminated with toxic mining waste into tributaries of the Rio Doce, releasing nearly 16 billion gallons \u2014 the equivalent of 25,000 Olympic swimming pools or 187 oil tankers \u2014 of contaminated material. The polluted water appears red in this image because it's laden with oxidized iron and other metals. A severe drought dries up the western United States NASA Advertisement These satellite images show the snowpack on the Sierra Nevada amid the wet year of 2011 (left) and the dry year of 2015 (right). Rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater supplies depend on melting snowpack for replenishment, especially amid the ongoing severe drought in California and other Western states. By March 2015, about one-third of monitoring stations in the Sierra Nevada recorded the lowest snowpack ever measured. Some sites reported no snow for the first time. Beijing issues its first ever air pollution \"red alert\" NASA As world leaders met in Paris for the United Nations climate conference, residents of Beijing and other cities in eastern China faced some of the most severe air pollution the nation has experienced, as seen in this satellite image captured on November 30. Roughly a week later, Beijing issued its first-ever \"red alert\" due to dangerous levels of smog \u2014 visible as brown- and yellow-tinged haze in this image \u2014 placing severe restrictions on the daily activities of the capital city's residents. Advertisement Historic rainfall in India follows harsh monsoon season NASA In early December, the Indian city of Chennai received more rainfall in 24 hours than it had seen on any day since 1901. The brightest spots in the above NASA satellite imagery show areas that accumulated 16 inches of rain or more in a 48-hour period. The deluge followed a month of persistent monsoon rains that were already well above normal for the region, and the pattern was intensified by record-warm seas and the long-distance effects of 2015's El Ni\u00f1o. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Royal Society Set to Release Evo Meeting Details Royal Society Set to Release Evo Meeting Details By Suzan Mazur, Contributor journalist journalist May 21, 2016, 10:01 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. The Royal Society science office says the suspense will soon be over. It will announce presenter names/topics for the November evolution paradigm shift conference within two weeks -- democratically, by email to all those registered to attend the public meeting. What's more, it has added to its original list of invitees. Zoologists perhaps at last conceding viruses belong in the tent? I understand that many of those in the Royal Society audience will be scientists as prominent as (and possibly more prominent than) some of the speakers, and as evolutionary science continues to be a tribal matter, it is expected to be a lively meeting. As for whether it will be an effective meeting, i.e., whether deep divisions can be bridged -- I'm optimistic. I am reminded of something Markus Nordberg , CERN's savvy chief of Resources Development, once told me about the strategy of organizing such meetings: \"When you invite friends of the friends, they don't argue too much . . . so that at least you have a little bit of critical mass . . . but then you have to expose it. That is to say, you organize a public meeting where the enemies of the friends are invited . . . it's polarized . . . people mix like hot and cold water. And that's the point at which you are able to set up a collaboration.\" However, grumblings about paradigm shift are coming not only from \"the enemies,\" i.e., the usual suspects (who are likely to send their disruptive \"representatives\" to the London gathering) -- but from more measured, responsible voices like Indiana University biologist Michael Lynch . Lynch recently responded to my story about the Extended Synthesis crowd who've now been funded by Templeton with $8M but still can't agree on a definition for Extended Synthesis with this note: \"Superficial, silly, shallow-minded, self-promotional. I and many others view this as a complete embarrassment to the field. If one wishes to extend something in public, especially as a biologist, one ought to have a very good idea of what is being extended.\" Even Stan Salthe , one of evolution's long-time progressive voices is dissatisfied with the fuzziness of language, emailing: Advertisement \"Philosophically, the only difference between the earlier (new) synthesis and the new (extended) one is that the new one downgrades random mutation as the only source of new departures, allowing the biological system to potentially have some agency in its evolution during ontogeny.\" There are some, in fact, who think the whole thing is a game of semantics and that I've \"been had\" regarding my interest. Denis Noble , point man for the Royal Society conference, further addressed the matter of evolutionary science word play in a recent email to me: Advertisement \"One of the problems I see in this field of evolutionary biology is that there are now a variety of definitions of what the neo-Darwinist Modern Synthesis includes. A recent reply to my J Exp Biol article even includes the inheritance of acquired characteristics! But if we define the Modern Synthesis as its original formulation to exclude the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which was Weizmann's intention, which was followed by many others and summarized by Mayr, then the ES must be a replacement not simply an extension and it is so by definition . Moreover, anyone who now tries to include the inheritance of acquired characteristics in neo-Darwinism is left with the question why it should any longer be described as neo -Darwinism since Darwin also included the inheritance of acquired characteristics in his Origin of Species and even, in a later work, developed his theory of gemmules to account for it. The key difference between Darwinism and neo-Darwinism disappears. There is then no need for neo-Darwinism. Of course there are many other reasons for replacing the MS by a more integrative, multi-process theory. Those include symbiogenesis, natural genetic engineering, the physics of development. . . . . . . . . .\" No doubt the virosphere is implied, as well, somewhere in Denis Noble's above \"extended ellipsis.\" Clearly, the Extended Synthesis does not go far enough in reflecting current evidence. The last major Extended Synthesis paper by Gerd M\u00fcller -- one of the fathers of the Extended Synthesis, who will be at the November gathering to explain his latest ES position -- was, e.g., virtually virus-free (the word virus appears one time). Advertisement Santa Fe Institute physicist Geoffrey West thinks the hard sciences definitely need to be factored into the equation at the November meeting. And Adrian Bejan , author of The Physics of Life , will attend to make sure they are. Other prominent scientists who've registered include biosemiotics ambassador Kalevi Kull , and plant physiologist/ambassador Franti\u0161ek Balu\u0161ka . Michael Joyner from Mayo Clinic and John Torday from UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine will bring their medical perspective to the gathering, as will neurobiologist and developmental psychologist Jonathan Delafield-Butt , who's now busily organizing his own conference in Scotland on autism . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I would expect both former Royal Society president Sir Paul Nurse and current president Sir Venki Ramakrishnan to waft in at some point during the three-day affair. And that there will no doubt be tributes (whether formal or informal) to some of evolution's revolutionaries, now gone: Mae-Wan Ho , Lynn Margulis and Carl Woese. Advertisement But it may well be the presence of science historian and dramatist Richard Milner -- currently promoting the life of Alfred Russell Wallace -- with his repertoire of disarming songs, such as \" I'm a Genius ,\" that proves most crucial to the November proceedings, that is, if chairs really do begin flying. . .

This Breathtaking Photo Shows Two Galaxies Merging Together The Hubble Space Telescope captured the spectacular sight. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 5, 2016, 04:56 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Two become one in this awe-inspiring image of galaxies merging together. The spectacular sight was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope last month. The photograph shows galaxy NGC 6052, which is located some 230 million light-years away from Earth, in the constellation of Hercules, in the process of being formed. Astronomers initially classified the galaxy as being \"a single abnormal\" one, according to the European Space Agency (ESA). But it's now confirmed to be a pair of star systems that are coming together. Advertisement The image may look chaotic, but scientists say that the new galaxy will eventually settle down into its new shape CREDIT: ESA/Hubble & NASA, Acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt \"Two separate galaxies have been gradually drawn together, attracted by gravity , and have collided,\" an ESA statement on the NASA website reveals. \"We now see them merging into a single structure.\" The image appears to be \"chaotic\" because individual stars are being thrown out of their original orbits during collisions in the merger, the statement says. \"Eventually, this new galaxy will settle down into a stable shape, which may not resemble either of the two original galaxies.\" Advertisement Galaxy mergers are common , according to Space.com, with our own Milky Way set to merge with our neighboring Andromeda galaxy in around 4 billion years time. The Hubble Space Telescope is named after Edwin Powell Hubble , one of the great pioneers of modern astronomy, and launched in 1990 aboard the space shuttle Discovery. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

SpaceX Rocket Blasts Off Carrying NASA's New Planet-Hunting Telescope The telescope is designed to detect worlds beyond our solar system that might be capable of harboring life. Joey Roullette Apr 19, 2018, 02:13 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Florida on Wednesday on SpaceX\u2019s first high-priority science mission for NASA, a planet-hunting orbital telescope designed to detect worlds beyond our solar system that might be capable of harboring life. The Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, lifted off on schedule from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:51 p.m. EDT, following a two-day postponement forced by a technical glitch found on Monday in the rocket\u2019s guidance-control system. Advertisement Within minutes of the launch, the main-stage booster separated from the upper part of the rocket and flew itself back to Earth for a successful touchdown on an unmanned landing vessel floating in the Atlantic. The @NASA_TESS spacecraft is now safely in space after a beautiful launch. It will spend the next 60 days getting to its proper orbit where it will search for unknown worlds beyond our solar system: https://t.co/Q7B7dMs7sM pic.twitter.com/qN4RK3oTLs \u2014 Thomas Zurbuchen (@Dr_ThomasZ) April 19, 2018 NASA\u2019s latest astrophysics satellite, meanwhile, soared on toward orbit, starting the clock on a two-year, $337 million quest to expand astronomers\u2019 known catalog of so-called exoplanets, worlds circling distant stars. Advertisement Wednesday\u2019s blastoff was a milestone of sorts for Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, the private launch service owned by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. The California-based company has launched cargo missions and other payloads for NASA before. But TESS marks the first under a special certification SpaceX has obtained to carry one of NASA\u2019s highest-priority science instruments. Advertisement TESS is designed to build on the work of its predecessor, the Kepler space telescope, which discovered the bulk of some 3,700 exoplanets documented during the past 20 years and is running out of fuel. NASA expects to pinpoint thousands more previously unknown worlds, perhaps hundreds of them Earth-sized or \u201csuper-Earth\u201d sized - no larger than twice as big as our home planet. Those are believed the most likely to feature rocky surfaces or oceans and are thus considered the best candidates for life to evolve. Scientists said they hope TESS will ultimately help catalog at least 100 more rocky exoplanets for further study in what has become one of astronomy\u2019s newest fields of exploration. Advertisement \u201cTESS is going to dramatically increase the number of planets that we have to study,\u201d TESS principal investigator George Ricker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told reporters in a pre-launch briefing on Sunday. Roughly the size of a refrigerator with solar-panel wings and four special cameras, TESS will take about 60 days to reach a highly elliptical orbit between Earth and the moon to begin its observations. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Like Kepler, TESS will use a detection method called transit photometry, which looks for periodic, repetitive dips in the visible light of stars caused by planets passing, or transiting, in front of them. Advertisement TESS will focus on 200,000 pre-selected stars that are relatively nearby and among the brightest as seen from Earth, making them better-suited for sensitive follow-up analysis. The telescope will concentrate on stars called red dwarfs, smaller, cooler and longer-lived than our sun. Red dwarfs also have a high propensity for Earth-sized, presumably rocky planets, making them potentially fertile ground for further scrutiny.

Were Dinosaurs Cold-Blooded Or Warm-Blooded? Or somewhere in between? Scientists aren't really sure. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 23, 2015, 09:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists still haven't settled the hot debate over whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded like birds and mammals or cold blooded like reptiles, fish and amphibians. And some research suggests that dinos may be somewhere in between . A new video (above) from the YouTube series SciShow explains that an analysis of dinosaur bones may prove that dinosaurs were mesotherms, not quite hot-blooded and not quite cold-blooded either . The mesothermy theory may help explain how the giant prehistoric creatures could have stayed active in cold weather -- when cold-blooded animals could not have -- and conserve energy when needed. Advertisement Are there any mesotherms alive today? The great white shark, tuna, and echidnas are just some of the middle-blooded creatures that are still thriving. Previously on HuffPost Science: Dinosaurs May Have Been Warm-Blooded, After All What other debates and common misconceptions are out there when it comes to dinosaurs? Check out the \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" episode below for five dinosaur myths that you probably thought were true. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Mesmerizing Astronomy Photos Are The Best Of 2015 These Are The Most Jaw-Dropping Space Photos Of The Year By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Jul 11, 2015, 08:37 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT If you have ever questioned the enormity and the drama of our universe, these photos will set you straight. The Royal Museums Greenwich in London selected these 17 stunning images, from more than 2,700 entries, to be considered for their annual Astronomy Photographer of the Year Competition . The winner will be announced on Sept. 17, after which the winning images will be exhibited at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. Advertisement From stars shining over salt flats in Bolivia, to the Lagoon Nebula thousands of light-years from earth, the photos reveal a gorgeous and diverse array of astronomical phenomena from 2015. Take a look below. Captions provided by Royal Museums Greenwich. Ascent of Angels \u00a9 Brad Goldpaint (USA) Following his first up-close encounter with a black bear, the photographer was relieved to reach his destination safely and capture this phenomenal image. A meteor can be seen piercing through the darkness as the Milky Way towers above the 4,392m peak of Mount Rainier in Washington, USA. The white lights dotted across the rocky paths of the mountain\u2019s face are the headlamps of hikers ascending to the peak. Aurora Panorama 3 \u00a9 Jan R. Olsen (Norway) The vivid green Northern Lights dance above Lyngenfjord, the longest fjord in Troms county Norway, tracing out the shape of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field above the waters. The most common colour associated with aurorae, the green is produced by oxygen atoms and molecules energised by the impact of solar particles that have escaped the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, causing them to glow brightly. Advertisement C/2014 Q2 Lovejoy \u00a9 Michael Jaeger (Austria) Comet Lovejoy sails through the solar system in a green haze leaving cometary dust in its wake. C/2014 Q2 is the fifth comet to have been discovered by Australian amateur astronomer and astrophotographer, Terry Lovejoy. Towards the end of 2014 and into the beginning of 2015 the comet could be seen through binoculars or in some special cases with the naked eye soaring through Earth\u2019s skies. The radiant blue-green contrasting against the backdrop of the night sky is due to the diatomic gas burning off it as it travels through space, and the disjointed tail illustrates the effects of a disturbance caused by solar winds. Calm Before the Storm \u00a9 Julie Fletcher (Australia) A phenomenal natural light show of a lightning storm emanating from the underside of ominous storm clouds juxtaposed with the gleaming stars of the Milky Way above them. The photographer had watched the storm front over Kati-Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park in South Australia for around two hours before capturing this tumultuous scene, using a graduated filter upside down to balance to exposure from top to bottom to showcase the beauty of our Galaxy. Full Moon over the Alps \u00a9 Stefano de Rosa (Italy) The majestic sight of the full moon setting behind the rose-tinted Alps. Taken in the silent surroundings of Superga hill in Turin, Italy, mere minutes before sunrise. Advertisement Great Nebula in Carina Bi-Colour \u00a9 Terry Robison (Canada) The hypergiant star Eta Carina glows against the background of swirling clouds of dust and gases that form the Carina Nebula. The Carina Nebula is one of the largest diffuse nebulae - meaning that it has no well-defined boundaries - in our skies and is about four times as large as the famed Orion Nebula. Herschel 36: The Heart of the Lagoon \u00a9 L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Francsics (Hungary) Situated some 5,000 light years away, the stellar nursery of the Lagoon Nebula lies in the constellation of Sagittarius. Despite being light years away the Lagoon Nebula is in fact one of the few star-forming nebulae that it is possible to see with the naked eye in optimum conditions from mid-northern latitudes. IC443 \u00a9 Patrick Gilliland (UK) Lying in the constellation of Gemini, IC443 is a galactic supernova remnant, a star that could have exploded as many as 30,000 years ago. Its globular appearance has earned the celestial structure the moniker of the Jellyfish Nebula. Advertisement M42 Subtle V1 cropped \u00a9 Patrick Gilliland (UK) One of the most well-known astronomical objects in our universe is the Orion Nebula and this image depicts the wider region of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex that is home to it. This complex is also home to another popular target for astrophotographers, the Horsehead Nebula, as well as Barnard's Loop and the Running Man Nebula that can be seen to the left of this photograph. The pinks and oranges that can be seen in the whorls of the nebulae are caused by the extremely hot hydrogen gas present in the structures. Moon and Antelao \u00a9 Marcella Giulia (Italy) Late afternoon at San Vito di Cadore, Italy the moon shines over Monte Antelao. The snow-covered dolomite ridge of the mountain and the Earth's only natural satellite bear a striking resemblance to one another, contrasting against the bright blue of the afternoon sky. The photographer noted the likeness of the image to a snowball bouncing down an inclined plane. Motind \u00a9 Rune Engebo (Norway) Living in Norway, the photographer had seen his fair share of aurorae, but on 21 January 2015 he witnessed the strongest variety of colours he had ever set eyes on in this beautiful explosion of purples and greens. Careening over the peaks of Senja, oxygen produces the greens and nitrogen the purples, seen in this particular display of the Northern Lights. Advertisement Roseta-NBv5 \u00a9 Juan Ignacio Jimenez (Spain) Measuring 50 light years in diameter, the large, round Rosette Nebula is found on the edge of a molecular cloud in the constellation of Monoceros the Unicorn. At the core of the nebula the very hot young stars have heated the surrounding gaseous shell to a temperature in the order of 6 million kelvins resulting in the emission of copious amounts of X-Rays. Here the photographer has applied a false colour palette to several pictures using narrowband filters, which only allow a specific colour of light to reach the camera, with each one linked to an interstellar gas, resulting in the striking blues and oranges. Solar Prominence \u00a9 Gary Palmer (UK) Searing hot loops of plasma radiate from the edge of our local star \u2013 the Sun \u2013 in a phenomenon known as a solar prominence. Emanating from the Sun\u2019s photosphere; its outer shell from which light is emitted, prominences extend to the corona, which is the aura of the plasma surrounding it. A typical prominence covers over thousands of kilometres, with the largest ever recorded estimated to be over 800,000 kilometres, equalling roughly the radius of the Sun itself. Star Trails over Green Lake \u00a9 Dan Barr (USA) Star trails illuminate the night sky over a campfire-lit Green Lake in the Hoover Wilderness of California. Star trails are a popular subject for astrophotographers to capture using long-exposure times. Whilst they appear to illustrate the movement of the stars, they are in fact depicting the rotation of the Earth on its axis. Advertisement The Mirrored Night Sky \u00a9 Xiaohua Zhao (China) An enthralled stargazer is immersed in the stars as the luminous purple sky is mirrored in the thin sheet of water across the world\u2019s largest salt flat, Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia. The Edge of the Aurora \u00a9 O Chul Kwon (Korea) A rare sighting of a red aurora, caused by the emission of high-altitude oxygen, captured on film, dancing over Yellowknife, the capital city of the Northwest Territories in Canada. The aurorae are a result of a large geomagnetic storm caused by a coronal mass ejection. Thor\u2019s Helmet (NGC 2359) \u00a9 Adam Block (USA) The distinctive shape of the nebula NGC 2359 has led to it also being known as Thor\u2019s Helmet, resembling the headgear of the Norse God (and Marvel superhero). Around 11 thousand light years away, the overall bubble shape is mainly due to interstellar material swept up by the winds of the nebula\u2019s central star Wolf-Rayet, an extremely hot giant thought to be in a pre-supernova stage.

Strong northwest winds blew ash and dust from the 1912 eruption of Novarupta over parts of Kodiak Island on Thursday, limiting visibility and prompting some airlines to cancel flights. The ash and dust mainly traveled over the southern and western parts of Kodiak Island after being carried roughly 100 miles from the Alaska Peninsula and across Shelikof Strait, said Mitch Sego, meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Alaska Aviation Weather Unit. \"It actually is light enough and fine enough where it can travel very long distances,\" Sego said of the material.

By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Oct 13, 2015, 08:26 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There's a reason orcas are commonly called killer whales, and last month, three fishermen witnessed it firsthand. In late September, Richard Baker and his 12-year-old son, Jackson, were fishing in New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf when they saw a pod of orcas swimming near their boat, according to New Zealand website Stuff. Jackson grabbed a camera and began filming the magical moment , but what he caught on camera instead was a deadly chase. Advertisement The orcas, as seen in the clips below, were hunting a dolphin for their next meal . Story continues below. Orcas, which are actually not whales but members of the dolphin family , are one of the ocean's top predators, thanks to their sheer power and killer hunting techniques . Advertisement It's not uncommon for them to feed on other species of dolphin, as well as several species of whale , sea lions and even the ocean's supposed apex predator -- great white sharks . \"They can take pretty much whatever they want ,\" John Ford, a research scientist and adjunct professor with the University of British Columbia's Marine Mammal Research Unit, said in a 2011 interview with Nature.com. Orcas pursue their prey in pods of up to 40 individuals , although they have been known to frequent the Hauraki Gulf, where Jackson's video was filmed, in pods of five to 15 . Advertisement They also use a cooperative hunting technique , according to National Geographic. \" Each whale has a role ,\" Tiu Simil\u00e4, a biologist and expert on orca hunting, told National Geographic of the orca hunting strategy. \"It's like a ballet, so they have to move in a very coordinated way and communicate and make decisions about what to do next,\" Simil\u00e4 said. Several weeks before Baker and his son witnessed the animals, another fisherman named Kasey \"Ox\" Coghlan filmed a similar attack in the same gulf . Advertisement \" This [is] nature laid out cold and bare ,\" Coghlan told Newsflare.com. Watch Baker's and Coghlan's videos below, and behold the awesome power of Mother Nature's hierarchy.

NASA Releases Last Image Of Pluto's Far Side Ahead Of Upcoming Flyby This Is The Last Image Of Pluto's Far Side We May See For Decades By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 12, 2015, 04:14 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Take a good look, folks. On Saturday, NASA released a stunning photo of Pluto captured by the New Horizons spacecraft. The image is the clearest view many of us will ever get of the four dark spots that have captivated stargazers and scientists since they were first seen in late June. The spots, which are being called Pluto's \" brass knuckles ,\" lie on the far side of the icy dwarf planet. The region will be rotated away from the New Horizons' cameras when the spacecraft has its close-range flyby on Tuesday. The image above gives \"the last, best look that anyone will have of Pluto\u2019s far side for decades to come,\" said Alan Stern, the principal investigator for the mission. The dark areas, all of which are about 300 miles in diameter, have intrigued scientists eager to know what they are and why they're so evenly spaced. \u201cIt\u2019s a real puzzle -- we don\u2019t know what the spots are, and we can\u2019t wait to find out,\u201d Stern said in a statement earlier this month. Advertisement \u201cWe can\u2019t tell whether they\u2019re plateaus or plains, or whether they\u2019re brightness variations on a completely smooth surface,\u201d said Jeff Moore, a scientist with NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, in the announcement. Tomorrow morning, we'll be at #Pluto ! :-) Where will you be?

'Bergxit': One Of The Largest Icebergs On Record Set To Break From Antarctic Shelf Experts say the chunk of ice will be larger than the island of Bali. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 5, 2017, 06:09 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An image released by NASA in November of the rift in the Larsen C ice shelf. NASA Earth Observatory WASHINGTON \u2014 When it splits off, the Delaware-sized chunk of ice now barely clinging to one of Antarctica\u2019s largest ice shelves will become one of the most massive icebergs in recorded history, scientists say. For over two years, the U.K.-based Project MIDAS has been monitoring a large, fast-moving rift in the Larsen C ice shelf , located on the northern end of the Antarctic Peninsula. On Wednesday, researchers with the European Space Agency released a detailed analysis of the soon-to-be iceberg. Advertisement Data collected from ESA\u2019s CryoSat satellite, which measures and monitors polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica, shows the iceberg will likely have an area of more than 2,500 square miles \u2014 larger than the island of Bali in Indonesia. It\u2019s expected to be about 620 feet thick and contain about 277 cubic miles of ice, according to ESA. Below the surface, the iceberg could reach a depth of nearly 700 feet. \u201cThis is a single piece which is remarkable I guess because it\u2019s of somewhat biblical proportions ,\u201d Mark Drinkwater, head of the mission science division at ESA\u2019s European Space Research and Technology Centre, told Mashable. Advertisement In a post to Twitter, Drinkwater said the hype around the impending separation has given rise to the term \u201cbergxit.\u201d \"Bergxit\"- a new term capturing the hype surrounding the inevitable separation of the #LarsenC iceberg from #Antarctica ! \ud83d\udd5a pic.twitter.com/eDTcdZyO9P \u2014 Mark Drinkwater (@kryosat) July 5, 2017 Researchers warn the iceberg will likely be so large that it could pose a risk to maritime traffic. \u201cWhole or in pieces, ocean currents could drag it north, even as far as the Falkland Islands,\u201d located east of South America\u2019s southern peninsula, Anna Hogg of the University of Leeds said in a statement. \u201cIf so it could pose a hazard for ships in Drake Passage\u201d \u2015 a stretch of ocean between South America\u2019s Cape Horn and Antarctica. Advertisement At 21,000 square miles , Larsen C is the largest ice shelf in the region . In recent years, however, what started as a small fracture has moved rapidly through the frozen structure, widening to more than 1,000 feet. During the month of December, the rift grew by more than 10 miles , followed by another 6 miles in the first few weeks of January. Between May 25 and May 31, it grew by an astounding 11 miles \u2014 over 1.5 miles per day. Today, the fissure is over 120 miles long, and only about three miles from reaching the ocean, according to ESA\u2019s new analysis. Advertisement \u201c The iceberg remains attached to the ice shelf , but its outer end is moving at the highest speed ever recorded on this ice shelf,\u201d researchers with Project MIDAS wrote in a blog post last week. \u201cWe still can\u2019t tell when calving will occur \u2014 it could be hours, days or weeks \u2014 but this is a notable departure from previous observations.\u201d Project MIDAS estimates the calving event will remove more than 10 percent of the Larsen C shelf, leaving the ice at \u201c its most retreated position ever recorded .\u201d Along with fundamentally changing the Antarctic Peninsula, scientists worry a break-off could destabilize the entire shelf, meaning Larsen C could be headed for a similar fate as nearby Larsen A and Larsen B , which collapsed and disintegrated in 1995 and 2002, respectively. Advertisement Larsen B\u2019s vanishing act is highlighted in the NASA video below: In 2014, over a decade after Larsen B\u2019s collapse, scientists determined the event was triggered by rising air temperatures . Since ice shelves float on the ocean\u2019s surface, the impending calving event won\u2019t immediately raise sea levels. An event of this scale, however, could destabilize the entire shelf, resulting in its disintegration and the release of the glacier ice it holds back \u2015 which ultimately would raise sea levels. How long that process could take is difficult to pinpoint. But scientists estimate that if all the glaciers behind Larsen C ended up in the ocean, it would raise global sea levels by about 10 centimeters, or 4 inches . CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated the iceberg\u2019s height above water was projected to be about 620 feet. In fact, that figure refers to its thickness.

China Launches 200-Day Test Of Self-Sustaining Space Station The students say they are happy to act as human guinea-pigs if it means getting closer to their dream of becoming astronauts. By Natalie Thomas Jul 10, 2017, 03:27 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Four students from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics entered the Lunar Palace-1 with the aim of living self-sufficiently for 200 days. STR via Getty Images BEIJING (Reuters) - Sealed behind the steel doors of two bunkers in a Beijing suburb, university students are trying to find out how it feels to live in a space station on another planet, recycling everything from plant cuttings to urine. They are part of a project aimed at creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that provides everything humans need to survive. Advertisement Four students from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics entered the Lunar Palace-1 on Sunday with the aim of living self-sufficiently for 200 days. They say they are happy to act as human guinea-pigs if it means getting closer to their dream of becoming astronauts. \u201cI\u2019ll get so much out of this,\u201d Liu Guanghui, a PhD student, who entered the bunker on Sunday, said. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a different life experience.\u201d Advertisement President Xi Jinping wants China to become a global power in space exploration, with plans to send the first probe to the dark side of the moon by 2018 and to put astronauts on the moon by 2036. The Lunar Palace 365 experiment may allow them to stay there for extended periods. The experiment aims to help Beijing achieve its long-term goal of putting humans on the moon. STR via Getty Images For Liu Hong, a professor at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the project\u2019s principal architect, said everything needed for human survival had been carefully calculated. Advertisement \u201cWe\u2019ve designed it so the oxygen (produced by plants at the station) is exactly enough to satisfy the humans, the animals, and the organisms that break down the waste materials,\u201d she said. But satisfying physical needs is only one part of the experiment, Liu said. Charting the mental impact of confinement in a small space for such a long time is equally crucial. \u201cThey can become a bit depressed,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIf you spend a long time in this type of environment it can create some psychological problems.\u201d Advertisement Liu Hui, a student leader who participated an initial 60-day experiment at Lunar Palace-1 that finished on Sunday, said that she sometimes \u201cfelt a bit low\u201d after a day\u2019s work. The project\u2019s support team has found mapping out a specific set of daily tasks for the students is one way that helps them to remain happy. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

But the 200-day group will also be tested to see how they react to living a for period of time without sunlight. The project\u2019s team declined to elaborate.
