Researchers Map Out Where Attention Lives In The Brain If You Can't Focus, Blame This Brain Region By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 23, 2015, 03:23 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Difficulty focusing, for many of us, is a daily reality of modern life. How many times do you open your email and get sidetracked from a more important task at work, or find yourself starting to zone out while a friend is telling you a story about his day? Probably pretty often. Scientists are starting to learn more about how the brain allocates its attentional resources -- and how our attention gets away from us. New research from neuroscientists at McGill University has identified, for the first time, a network of neurons critical to our ability to control attention. Advertisement A complex of neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex of the brain, an area involved in many aspects of executive behavioral control , including selective attention, strategic behavioral planning, short-term information retention and action selection. These neurons interact with one another to filter visual information while also ignoring distractions. While previous research has identified individual neurons that carry attentional signals, there was not yet a sense of a larger neural \"attentional map,\" lead researcher Dr. Julio Martinez-Trujillo explained to The Huffington Post. \"What was unclear [previously] is whether the are contains a map of activity that can signal where attention is allocated, within the short time we use to orient attention (few hundred millisecond),\" Martinez-Trujillo said in an email to the Huffington Post. \"The contribution of this study is that we obtained a realistic estimate of the attentional map, which is composed of, not only one neuron but of many neurons that interact with one another.\" Advertisement The researchers recorded the brain activity of macaque monkeys as they shifted their gaze to look at objects displayed on a computer screen, which also ignoring visual distractions. Then, the recorded brain signals were input on a computer decoder which mimicked the computations of the brain as it focused. To the researchers' surprise, the computer decoder was able to consistently and accurately predict where the monkeys were covertly focusing their attention before they even looked that way -- and, even before the onset of a distraction, they were able to predict whether the monkey would be distracted by a visual stimulus. What's more, the researchers were able to create focused and distracted states by manipulating neural interactions. Advertisement One hypothesis derived from these findings is that there must be a particular amount of interaction between neurons in the prefrontal cortex in order for attention to be properly directed. In children with ADHD, for instance, these interactions may be excessive, causing disruptions in their ability to focus attention. \"It is essential for us is to corroborate this hypothesis in the near future,\" said Martinez-Trujillo. \"One can imagine that drugs or other interventions that could manipulate interactions between neurons within the prefrontal map could be used to treat disorders of attention (focusing too little or too much).\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The findings may have important implications for those suffering from autism, ADHD and schizophrenia, which all involve disruptions in one's ability to focus. Advertisement \"This suggests that we are tapping into the mechanisms responsible for the quality of the attentional focus, and might shed light into the reasons why this process fails in certain neurological diseases such as ADHD, autism and schizophrenia,\" S\u00e9bastien Tremblay, a doctoral student at McGill and one of the study's authors, said in a statement . \"Being able to extract and read the neuronal code from higher-level areas of the brain could also lead to important breakthroughs in the emerging field of neural prosthetics, where people who are paralysed use their thoughts to control objects in their environment.\" The findings were recently published in the journal Neuron .

Watch 15 Years Of Earthquakes Rock The Planet This animation is as mesmerizing as it is frightening. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 2, 2016, 09:51 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Make no mistake: Earth is a powerful and, at times, violent planet. And if you had any doubts, this new jaw-dropping animation ought to put them to rest. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Pacific Tsunami Warning Center released a video Friday mapping every earthquake as it occurred from Jan. 1, 2001, through Dec. 31, 2015. Advertisement The visual is as mesmerizing and enlightening as it is frightening. As seen above, earthquakes appear as colorful circles, with colors representing depth, and size representing magnitude. Each second represents 30 days. There\u2019s no shortage of activity \u2015 Earth\u2019s tectonic plate boundaries light up like a Christmas tree. At the end of the animation, every recorded tremor over that 15-year period is shown, followed by only those quakes greater than magnitudes 6.5 and 8. Advertisement \u201cThis time period includes some remarkable events,\u201d including several quakes that caused \u201cdevastating tsunamis,\u201d NOAA wrote in a post about the animation. Those tsunami-generating quakes include the devastating 9.1-magnitude tremor in Sumatra in 2004, an 8.8 magnitude in Chile in 2010 and the 9.0-magnitude quake off Japan\u2019s northeastern coast in 2011 that killed nearly 16,000 people and caused a meltdown of nuclear reactors at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Astronomers Giddy Over What They Call A Cosmic 'Dinosaur Egg' About To Hatch Astronomers Giddy Over Bizarre Cosmic 'Dinosaur Egg' By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 9, 2015, 08:24 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A dense cloud of gas 50 million light-years away has astronomers buzzing, and they're using all sorts of strange metaphors to get the rest of us to pay attention. They've discovered what they think may be a globular cluster -- a big ball of up to one million stars -- on the verge of being born. \u201cThis remarkable object looks like it was plucked straight out of the very early universe,\" Dr. Kelsey Johnson, an astronomer at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and lead author on a paper about the research, said in a written statement. \"To discover something that has all the characteristics of a globular cluster, yet has not begun making stars, is like finding a dinosaur egg that\u2019s about to hatch .\u201d Advertisement (Story continues below images.) The Antennae galaxies, shown in visible light in a Hubble image (upper image), were studied with ALMA, revealing extensive clouds of molecular gas (center right image). One cloud (bottom image) is incredibly dense and massive, yet apparently star free, suggesting it is the first example of a prenatal globular cluster ever identified. ALMA image of dense cores of molecular gas in the Antennae galaxies. The round yellow object near the center may be the first prenatal example of a globular cluster ever identified. It is surrounded by a giant molecular cloud. Johnson and her colleagues spotted the bizarre object, which they call the \"Firecracker,\" using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama desert in Chile. It's located inside a pair of interacting galaxies known to scientists as NGC 4038/NGC 4039, or The Antennae Galaxies. Advertisement The Firecracker has a mass that's 50 times that of our sun, and is under an enormous amount of pressure -- roughly 10,000 times greater than the average pressure in interstellar space. According to the researchers, this makes it a good candidate for collapsing into a globular cluster within the next million years. What do other scientists make of the discovery? Dr. Alison Peck, ALMA scientist at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, who was not involved in the new research, called it \"important\" and said she was \"really excited to hear about these results.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

She told The Huffington Post in an email: \"One of the things that we all yearn to understand is how our surroundings formed, how our galaxy and our solar system came to be. To do this, since we can\u2019t actually watch things change over time, (it just takes too long), we need to find similar objects at different stages of development and compare them. What Dr. Johnson\u2019s team have found here is an analog of an object that we look for in the very early universe, but they\u2019ve found it so close by that we\u2019ll be able to make extremely detailed observations and find out much more about the physical conditions in this exciting region.\" The research is set to be published in the Astrophysical Journal.

In an interview with HuffPost Live on Thursday, Nye said that with so many galaxies in the universe, chances are that alien life exists somewhere. \"It's gotta exist outside the solar system,\" he told host Josh Zepps . \"I mean there's 200 billion stars in this galaxy alone. Then you start talking about the hundreds of billions of galaxies. Hundreds of billions of galaxies, which in turn have hundreds of billions of stars, which in turn have tens of hundreds of billions -- trillions -- of planets.

Scientists Make Metal So Waterproof That Droplets Simply Bounce Off This Metal Is So Waterproof That Droplets Bounce Off By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 22, 2015, 08:16 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Step aside, Teflon. Physicists at the University of Rochester have found a way to make metal so resistant to water that any droplets that fall on it simply bounce off like tiny basketballs. (Story continues below.) Apart from being freaky to watch in action, the first-of-its kind material may have important applications--from making better devices for collecting rainwater in water-scarce developing countries, to improving the sanitation of toilets , to making airplane wings and solar panels resistant to rusting or icing over. Advertisement How did the scientists create this seemingly magical material? They used a powerful laser to etch minute micro- and nanoscale patterns onto brass, titanium, and platinum. The process takes a while--up to a full hour to treat a single square inch of metal--but it's said to have key advantages over chemical coatings like Teflon, which can wear away. \" Our surface has many advantages over the coatings out there ,\" Dr. Chunlei Guo, a professor at the university's Institute of Optics, says in a video describing the research (see below). \"First, our surface has a much stronger hydrophobic effect than the coatings, and secondly, we don't have to worry about coatings peeling off and the surface degrading over time.\" Advertisement Before trying to commercialize the process, the researchers plan to try the laser patterning technique on non-metallic materials--and look for ways to speed up the etching process. The research was published online Jan. 20 in the Journal of Applied Physics. Check out the video below to learn more about the research.

Space Virtual Reality Will Soon Let You Experience Orbiting Earth \"Anyone will have the opportunity to sit down and put on any VR headset and be immediately immersed in the majestic beauty of space.\" By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Aug 19, 2016, 08:38 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This artist's conception shows the Overview 1 virtual reality satellite, which will give Earth-bound headset wearers the look and feel of being in orbit. SpaceVR If you\u2019ve ever wondered how it actually feels to fly above Earth and look down at the amazing planet we call home, you\u2019ll soon be able to do that from the comfort of your living room. Overview 1, the world\u2019s first virtual reality cube satellite, plans to beam high-definition live images of Earth and space to a VR headset near you next year. Advertisement \u201cWe\u2019re going to offer virtual reality content, live to people from space. Anyone will have the opportunity to sit down and put on any VR headset and be immediately immersed in the majestic beauty of space,\u201d said SpaceVR founder and CEO Ryan Holmes. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see the Earth against the stars, and I\u2019m sure that will give it a depth to the experience.\u201d Holmes told The Huffington Post how the idea for SpaceVR relates to something known as the Overview Effect . \u201cI came across this documentary called \u201cOverview\u201d about astronauts going into space and how, when they see the Earth, they experience an almost biological change in themselves, and how they perceive the world and their place in it.\u201d Advertisement \u201cThey all come back changed and all have this amazing perspective shift,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really clear to me after reading the book version, I realized that, if the average person could experience this, all across the world, then we would live in a fundamentally different society.\u201d In the video below, Holmes expands on the concept of what SpaceVR will bring to the public: The first step in getting this remarkable satellite camera system into space involves SpaceVR sending Overview 1 to NanoRacks in Houston, Texas, which routinely serves researchers, space agencies and educators by packaging and preparing small satellite payloads for launch and delivery to the International Space Station. Advertisement Overview 1 will be transported on board a SpaceX ship that regularly delivers cargo from Earth to the ISS. \u201cNanoRacks will put it inside a box with other satellites, and this box has eight spring-loaded slots. The box will be placed on the rocket which will be launched to the space station. The ISS astronauts will then use a robot arm to grab the box and will activate the spring-loaded launchers, which will shoot Overview 1 [pictured below] into orbit,\u201d said Holmes. Overview 1's makers say the virtual reality satellite will offer Earthlings the experience of being in orbit -- right in their own living rooms. SpaceVR Advertisement The countdown is on for a scheduled launch in June 2017.

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 18, 2016, 08:28 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Sean Locke via Getty Images Trying to have any meaningful discussion about the climate change crisis with someone who rejects mainstream science is a recipe for frustration. And with a president-elect who has said climate change is \u201c bullshit \u201d and a \u201c hoax ,\u201d it\u2019s likely many family holiday celebrations this year will include unproductive and, shall we say, spirited banter.

Scripps Institution of Oceanography This graph shows the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, from 1958 to today. In September, scientists at Mauna Loa announced that C02 levels had likely surpassed the threshold of 400 parts per million permanently . 2 Year over year, the trend becomes more obvious.

Pluto May Have Underground Ocean, Evidence Suggests The ocean is likely a slushy one, hiding beneath Pluto's heart-shaped central plain. Irene Klotz Nov 16, 2016, 04:23 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING HOUSTON - Scientists have found evidence that tiny, distant Pluto harbors a hidden ocean beneath the frozen surface of its heart-shaped central plain containing as much water as all of Earth\u2019s seas. The finding, reported on Wednesday in two research papers published in the journal Nature, adds Pluto to a growing list of worlds in the solar system beyond Earth believed to have underground oceans, some of which potentially could be habitats for life. Advertisement Pluto\u2019s ocean, which is likely slushy with ice, lies 93 to 124 miles (150 to 200 km) beneath the dwarf planet\u2019s icy surface and is about 62 miles (100 km) deep, planetary scientist Francis Nimmo of the University of California, Santa Cruz said in an interview. With its ocean covered by so much ice, Pluto is not a prime candidate for life, added Massachusetts Institute of Technology planetary scientist Richard Binzel, another of the researchers. But Binzel added that \u201cone is careful to never say the word impossible.\u201d Liquid water is considered one of the essential ingredients for life. The discovery was made through an analysis of images and data collected by NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto and its entourage of moons in July 2015. Advertisement \u201cIt shows that nature is more creative than we are able to imagine, which is why we go and explore,\u201d Binzel said. \u201cWe see what nature is capable of doing.\u201d Despite being about 40 times farther from the sun than Earth, Pluto has enough radioactive heat left over from its formation 4.6 billion years ago to keep water liquid. \u201cPluto has enough rock that there\u2019s quite a lot of heat being generated, and an ice shell a few hundred kilometers thick is quite a good insulator,\u201d Nimmo said. \u201cSo a deep subsurface ocean is not too surprising, especially if the ocean contains ammonia, which acts like an antifreeze.\u201d Advertisement Scientists made the discovery as they were trying to figure out why a 621-mile (1,000-km) wide impact basin known as Sputnik Planitia, which contains the curious heart-shaped region, was located in its present position near Pluto\u2019s equator. Computer models showed the basin likely filled with ice, which caused Pluto to roll over, cracking its crust. That could happen only if Pluto possessed a subsurface ocean, the analysis found. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Loneliness Is Bad For You, And This Study May Help Explain Why Feeling lonely may trigger changes in our cells that could make us more susceptible to illness. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Nov 28, 2015, 08:53 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Loneliness can affect the production of white blood cells in our bodies, study shows. EvgeniaSh via Getty Images Scientists have long known that spending time with loved ones is good for our long-term health and may reduce our risk of cognitive decline , whereas loneliness is linked to high blood pressure, inflammation and a weakened immune system . But why exactly does loneliness have such bad effects on our health and well-being? One reason, according to a new study, may have to do with the way loneliness triggers cellular changes in our bodies that can make us more susceptible to viral infections. Advertisement \"Feeling lonely means you are not in a socially affine environment but rather in a relatively hostile environment,\" Dr. John Cacioppo, a professor of psychology and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"In socially affine environments, protection against viral infections is especially important, whereas in hostile environments, protection against bacteria is important,\" Cacioppo wrote. \"The pattern of gene expression in the lonely [environment] decreases protection against viral infections and instead may increase protection against bacterial infections.\" In other words, as Live Science notes, the cellular changes that result in a shift toward protection against bacteria may come at the cost of the ability to protect against viral infections. Advertisement For the study, researchers analyzed the regulation of the leukocyte gene -- which is involved in protecting the body against both bacteria and viruses -- in 141 older adult humans over a five-year period, and in a separate group of rhesus macaque monkeys that displayed behavior indicative of social isolation. The researchers noticed increased activity in genes that produce inflammation in the body and less activity in genes that help to fight off illness in the adults who were lonely and in the monkeys, The Telegraph reported. In the monkeys, researchers also found that loneliness causes the body to produce \"fight-or-flight\" stress signals, which can impair the body's antiviral responses. Advertisement For instance, when the researchers infected monkeys with simian immunodeficiency virus, the virus grew faster in the monkeys that were classified as socially isolated than in monkeys that were not \"lonely,\" according to Live Science. This may be a result of the immune system releasing monocytes , a particular kind of immune cell linked to high levels of inflammatory proteins and low levels of antiviral proteins. The researchers concluded that inflammation and impaired antiviral responses contribute to the bad health effects of loneliness. The findings appear to support previous research suggesting that for older adults, feelings of social isolation may increase the risk of premature death by 14 percent . \"This study specifically showed loneliness causes a physiological reaction in people ,\" Dr. Matthew Lorber, acting director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the new research, told CBS News. Advertisement \"This is the first study I have seen that has actually gone into the details of showing loneliness leading to a decreased production of leukocytes (disease-fighting cells) and an increased production of immature monocytes,\" Lorber said. \"Leukocytes are what our body needs to fight infection. The fact that loneliness is leading to a decreased production of the leukocytes is really fascinating to me.\" But to be clear, the research doesn't conclusively prove anything. The U.K.'s National Health Service pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday that \"this study has not proved that socially isolated humans are more likely to become ill or die earlier. ... Feelings of loneliness and social isolation can be complex emotions that may be influenced by many personal, health and life circumstances.\" Still, the NHS went on, \"what is fairly apparent from this and previous research is that, whatever the biological mechanism(s) that may be behind it, loneliness and social isolation do seem to be associated in some way with disease and illness.\" Advertisement The researchers said that they plan to continue examining how loneliness leads to poor health outcomes, and how these effects can be prevented in older adults. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.

This Is The Next Step In Saving The Planet, According To E.O. Wilson & Sean Carroll Iconic Scientists Weigh In On How To Save The Planet By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 3, 2015, 10:34 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Edward O Wilson made his name by arguing that two apparently disparate things \u2013 human society and the natural world \u2013 are governed by the same principles. Sean B Carroll made his name by unifying the study of humans and animals, showing that development in both is driven by the same fundamental molecular and genetic processes. So what happened when these two scientists were brought together? They decided to unify all of biology. Carroll visited Wilson\u2019s office at Harvard University for a free-ranging, hours-long chat. It covered concerns for the future and reminiscing about the past \u2013 and morphed into an idea for a global campaign to unite biologists behind the common cause of saving the natural world, a prerequisite for understanding it.

If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Yavuz Anacak , Ege University Like most things, cancer diagnosis is not equal for men and women. In adults, sexual hormones, dietary habits, exposure to carcinogens, smoking and alcohol consumption combine to give rise to a situation where more men than women are diagnosed with cancer globally . Worldwide, 7.4 million cancers are diagnosed in men and 6.6 million are diagnosed in women. Lung, prostate and colorectal cancer are the most common types among men, whereas breast, colorectal and lung cancer are the top three among women. But the factors that lead to this difference between the genders all affect us later in life, and should not apply to children . Yet the present data shows that more boys than girls are diagnosed with cancer worldwide. Advertisement The same risk Survival rates of childhood cancers have increased dramatically in high-income countries. More than 80% of child cancer patients are expected to survive at least five years in the United States and UK . Unfortunately, survival rates are still very poor in many developing countries. There is no obvious reason for a distinction in cancer incidence in childhood. Boys and girls are at similar genetic risk for developing cancer, unless sex chromosomes are involved. Sex hormones do not kick in until our mid-teens, meaning breast cancer or prostate cancer are extremely rare among children. Children are most affected by leukemia, lymphoma, brain tumors and embryogenic tumors such as neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. Advertisement Boys and girls usually share the same environment and consume the same food; there is no occupational exposure to external carcinogens at these ages, and tobacco or alcohol consumption is low or non-existent. Because the risk factors for cancer development are similar, we should see a similar incidence of cancer among boys and girls, with an expected male to female ratio of close to one - that is, for every boy who gets cancer, one girl should too. Yet an analysis of data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) shows this is not true. Advertisement Worldwide differences IARC estimates that every year, 163,000 children between ages 0 and 14 are diagnosed with cancer worldwide. Of these, 94,000 are boys and 68,000 are girls. This leads to a global ratio of 1.37 - so four boys are diagnosed with cancer for every three girls. Gender distribution of childhood cancers worldwide. But it's not the same story everywhere. The male-to-female ratio is nearly one-to-one in high-income regions, including America and Australia. In Europe, the Middle East and Latin America it is less than 1.3. In Southern Asia, however, the rate is higher than 1.6. Gender discrimination The reasons of this gender imbalance are not yet known. But we have some clues. As we have seen poorer countries tend to have more of a gender imbalance in childhood cancers. Advertisement These rates also correspond with levels of gender equality. International gender equality rankings show that in North America, Australia and Europe, women and men are more equal than in, say, Southern Asia. A previous study , published in 2001, found a similar diagnosis gap between boys and girls. The authors concluded: Elevated sex ratios in developing countries reflect the socio-economic level of the society more than the nature and aetiology of the disease. So the most likely reason for the gap in many countries is that girls are less likely than boys to be referred to a doctor when they fall ill. If this is the reason, it should be accepted as another sign of gender discrimination against girls. And the fact that we see such a gender imbalance in cancer diagnosis between boys and girls requires urgent attention not only from scientists and researchers, but also health-care providers and governments. Taking action The Sustainable Development Goals, a set of ambitious targets adopted by the United Nations in 2015, mandate that the world must achieve gender equality by 2030. This is an enormous task. Advertisement If the UN aims to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls everywhere, it must address the fact that cancer is not being diagnosed in girls at the same rate as boys. All efforts should be mobilised to increase the access of girls to medical care. This will increase the rates of cancer diagnosis and allow girls to provide proper treatment, eventually closing the gap with boys. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Nepal's Earthquake Made Mount Everest A Little Bit Shorter, Scientists Say Nepal's Earthquake Made Mount Everest A Little Bit Shorter, Scientists Say By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter May 2, 2015, 11:19 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT In addition to taking a devastating humanitarian toll, the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that hit central Nepal on April 25 also shrank Mount Everest. The world\u2019s tallest mountain shrank by about one inch in the quake , according to information provided by UNAVCO, a nonprofit geoscience research consortium, to the site LiveScience. The analysis is based on data from the European Space Agency Sentinel-1A satellite , which passed over the affected area for the first time on April 29. Advertisement When the fault between the India and Eurasia tectonic plates slipped, causing the earthquake, strain was released that allowed the Earth\u2019s crust to relax. That relaxation led to a slight reduction of the height of Everest. In an email to The Huffington Post, Roger Bilham, a fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research In Environmental Sciences and a professor in geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, compared the process to suddenly releasing an eraser that's been squeezed. \"Squeeze an eraser and it rises,\" he said. \"Let go and it shrinks back to its original shape.\" Bilham estimates that Everest shrank by one or two millimeters, while the Annapurna Range, a mountain range located in central Nepal closer to the earthquake, actually grew by 20 centimeters, or roughly 8 inches. Advertisement In the above image provided by the German Aerospace Center, the blue region surrounding Kathmandu rose upwards toward the satellite by around 2.6 feet. Yellow areas subsided, or shrank, in elevation away from the satellite. According to the ESA, the ground also shifted horizontally by up to six and a half feet in some areas. Similarly to the Annapurna Range, an area around Nepal's capital city of Kathmandu was actually lifted up vertically by around 3 feet, according to an analysis by the German Aerospace Center . The area is estimated to be more than 55 miles long and 18 miles wide. Data gleaned by the Sentinel-1A satellite is also useful to scientists interested in the mechanics of the quake itself.

Geologist Discovers Plant That May Only Grow On Top Of Soil Laden With Diamonds Geologist Discovers Plant That May Only Grow On Top Of Diamonds By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost May 7, 2015, 05:48 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There she grows! A picky plant found in West Africa may grow only on top of mineral deposits often loaded with diamonds, according to research soon to be published in the journal Economic Geology . Stephen Haggerty , a professor at Florida International University in Miami and the chief exploration officer of Youssef Diamond Mining Company, said the discovery could be a game changer for the region. The thorny plant, Pandanus candelabrum, only grows atop deposits of kimberlite, a type of volcanic rock found in giant underground \"columns\" around the world. Diamonds, formed hundreds of kilometers deep by intense heat and pressure , are pushed upward with the kimberlite during subterranean volcanic activity, resulting in gem-rich veins of rock. Pandanus candelabrum, left, is seen in the Liberian jungle. Until recently, there was no reliable way to locate these concentrated deposits of diamonds, which can be just a few acres in size and buried in thick, remote parts of the jungle. Advertisement Haggerty made the discovery in the bush of Liberia after venturing to the country in 2010 to continue research he began in the 1970s. He told The Huffington Post that Liberia, infamous for its trade in so-called \" blood diamonds ,\" had extensive mining operations in place, but the miners had no real way of knowing where to look for the gems. The region is covered in dense forest \"so inaccessible, you can't see more than 10 feet in front of you,\" he said. Moving through the jungle and taking soil samples with an 8-foot steel rod, Haggerty eventually discovered a kimberlite \"pipe\" about 500 by 50 meters, or 1640 by 164 feet. Four diamonds , two of them around 20 carats apiece, have already been found in the soil above the pipe, according to Science magazine. Aside from the pipe itself, Haggerty's most interesting observation was the discovery of Pandanus candelabrum, which thrives on a unique mixture of minerals found in the kimberlite soil. \"For reasons that we don't yet know,\" he said, P. candelabrum appears to grow only atop these diamond-rich deposits. Advertisement Various plants have been used as discovery elements for other metal-laden soils, Haggerty said. Scientists uncovered some eucalyptus trees in 2013 that contained gold in their leaves , having tapped into mineral deposits deep underground with their far-reaching roots. Haggerty said he hopes to use satellite mapping of the plants (via their spectral signatures ) to help unearth new pipes of kimberlite throughout Liberia. \"That's the way geology works. We don't operate in singularities,\" Haggerty said. \"If there's one pipe, there have to be others.\" Advertisement Still, not all kimberlite deposits contain diamonds -- in fact, only about 1 percent of the world's known kimberlite pipes \"are rich enough in quality diamonds to be worth mining,\" writes Eric Hand at Science . But if the mapping goes as hoped, it could pave the way for new diamond exploration in the country that could help boost local economies without harming the environment. Whereas a lot of current diamond mining involves unearthing and discarding all kinds of substances, some of them terrible for the environment, the main by-product of mining at kimberlite sites would be the kimberlite itself -- which is basically composed of the same nutrients as garden fertilizer. In a country still battling Ebola and malaria, Haggerty said, that could be a saving grace. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Getting Down and Dirty With Big Healthcare Data Humans are fallible. Humans entering data into healthcare records are no different. Even if there is internal reliability (within a hospital), in the era of data sharing across institutions on variable EHRs, there is increasing room for error. By Tim Imler, Contributor Clinical Informaticist and Gastroenterologist Clinical Informaticist and Gastroenterologist Nov 28, 2015, 08:02 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. In 2005, President George W. Bush spoke at the Cleveland Clinic while I was there as a precocious third-year medical student. His goal was to promote a 10-year plan to computerize half of Americans healthcare data to allow for secure healthcare data sharing across institutions [ 1 ]. Flash forward four years to February of 2009, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Obamacare to some) was enacted with the goal to \"promote the adoption and meaningful use of interoperable health information technology\"[ 2 ]. As part of the Medicare program there have been incentives (and future punishments) for incorporating the ability to share healthcare information through health information exchanges. This would (in a perfect world) allow for a healthcare provider to view data from other institutions and potentially improve quality and/or decrease costs (value). As a gastroenterologist and Director of the Data Core in Research Services at the Regenstrief Institute , I have been a major advocate for secure widespread sharing of healthcare data to improve the value of healthcare in American (more on this in future postings). The overall goal is to have the right information, at the right time, to the right person to make the right decision for the patient (R Goal). The Regenstrief Institute houses the oldest and largest health information exchange (HIE) in the country with over 30 years of electronic health records on 18 million unique individuals and over 4 billion clinical data points (e.g. labs, billing codes, etc.). With over 80 hospitals now participating in healthcare data sharing, this is a model for a national health information exchange that was envisioned by President Bush and pushed forward by the monetary rewards of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Advertisement This all sounds wonderful from the surface (and from the politicians). However, the reality of healthcare data is that it does not work as well as what we would hope. We are now 10 years later and have, as of 2014, 76% of hospitals on at least a \"basic\" electronic health record system (EHR) [ 3 ]. However, the decision to rapidly expand the electronic availability of healthcare records has some major downstream consequences. For instance, can your gender change throughout your life? You can within healthcare data, even without involving Caitlyn Jenner's surgeons [ 4 ]. Or can a patient be born after they die? Sean Connery was able to do this back in 1967 [ 5 ], and yes, it happens in healthcare data. Advertisement These are real scenarios that have been published in peer reviewed healthcare literature and impact the care of real life patients. How does this happen? The answer is complex and a combination of people and policies that have not been aligned as we have digitalized the healthcare enterprise. Have no fear of perfection -- you'll never reach it. - Salvador Dali Humans are fallible. Humans entering data into healthcare records are no different. Gender, date of birth, ethnicity and many other demographic factors are often manually entered by a clerk or medical assistant within a health care system. Billing codes are assigned from hospitalizations by reviewing the documentation (often incomplete) and potentially assigning a non-specific code (more on ICD9/10 in future posts). 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Even if there is internal reliability (within a hospital), in the era of data sharing across institutions on variable EHRs, there is increasing room for error. This is so common that researchers will often choose the gender, race or date of birth that is closest to their topic of interest or take the demographic characteristic that occurs most often. It is unclear, then, how much these assumptions play a role in outcomes of research, therefore influencing future patient care simply due to information entered at the initial point of care. In other words, would you want a future doctor of yours to use outdated or incorrect information to treat you? Advertisement How do you fix this? Well, Salvador Dali was correct in stating that we should have no fear of perfection, but we can put processes in place to make it more reachable. Over the next months, I will highlight specific research questions posed and how the \"dirtiness\" of data effects the assumptions that we make and the outcomes of research. Hopefully this will illuminate the challenges faced within \"Big Data\" in the healthcare field and generate discussion of how to handle the imperfect world in which we live.

Science Has Determined How Not To Look Stupid Here are the three most common forms of \"stupidity.\" You're welcome. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 27, 2015, 09:55 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Alen-D via Getty Images Whether it's your sibling, best friend, parent or even your boss, you've called someone stupid at some point in your life. But how do we even define \"stupid\" behavior, and what can we do to avoid acting stupidly? A new study offers a scientific answer. \"Although calling something stupid is a frequent everyday behavior,\" Bal\u00e1zs Acz\u00e9l, a psychology professor at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email, \"there has been no psychological study to understand why and when people use this label to describe the observed actions.\" Advertisement Acz\u00e9l and his colleagues gathered 180 pieces of writing from the news, blog sites, and social media that might be deemed as \"stupid.\" The pieces were then presented to 154 adults who were asked to fill out a survey about each story. The study participants answered whether they thought the behaviors and actions in the writing clips were stupid, and how stupid they considered them to be on a scale from one to 10. The researchers found that, despite the ambiguous definition of \"stupid,\" there was a 90 percent rate of agreement between participants in which actions were seen as stupid. The researchers also noticed that there were three different types of behaviors, which were most often deemed as stupid. Advertisement \"In our statistical analysis of the data we found that people regard stupid action in three different categories: (1) violations of maintaining a balance between confidence and abilities; (2) failures of attention; and (3) lack of control,\" Acz\u00e9l said. Here are examples of the three categories: 1. Overconfidence Acz\u00e9l described it as \"confident ignorance,\" or when someone is overconfident about their ability to do something. An example of this behavior is when a driver refuses to ask for directions, and might end up lost. \"What that tells us is that you don\u2019t have to have a low IQ, in people\u2019s eyes, to act stupidly. You just have to misperceive your abilities ,\"Acz\u00e9l told The Washington Post. Advertisement 2. Lack of control A lack of willpower or control might be when your friend is on a diet but buys cookies in the grocery store \"just in case.\" 3. Absent-mindedness Absent-minded behavior could be described as when someone who buys a car doesn't know how to change the oil, and thus, the vehicle breaks down on the side of the road. The researchers noted that more research is needed to determine how much of their findings are influenced by culture and shared expectations. Advertisement But for now, \"these results bring us closer to understanding the rationalistic norms that people use in monitoring and evaluating behavior,\" they concluded. The study was published in the November-December 2015 edition of the journal Intelligence .

Mars Looks Eerily Similar To Earth In This Dramatic New Panorama NASA's Curiosity Rover snaps another great shot! By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Aug 19, 2016, 03:47 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It ain\u2019t Earth, but it sure could\u2019ve fooled us. A dramatic 360-degree panorama , released Friday by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab, shows the surface of Mars looking a lot like the southwestern U.S. The image, which was shot on Aug. 5 by the Mast Camera aboard the Curiosity rover, most notably highlights a formation known as the Murray Buttes on Mount Sharp , a peak that rises 18,000 feet over the floor of the valley in which it\u2019s located. Advertisement More than 130 individual pictures make up the stunning visual. All of them were snapped from the rover\u2019s position during the afternoon of the mission\u2019s 1,421st sol (Martian day), which was also the fourth anniversary of Curiosity\u2019s landing on Mars. It\u2019s hard to tell scale from a quick glance, but NASA says the dark mesa just left of Curiosity\u2019s robotic arm is about 50 feet high and 300 feet from the rover\u2019s position. You can also see an upper portion of Mount Sharp to the left of the mesa. For comparison, here\u2019s a vintage shot of a sandstone butte in New Mexico called Enchanted Mesa: Public domain Advertisement Still curious about Curiosity? The video below explains what the rover has accomplished during its four-year (and counting) sojourn on the red planet.

James Webb Space Telescope Will Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before Incredibly powerful telescope will look back in time toward the Big Bang of creation. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Nov 29, 2016, 08:30 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT An artist conception of the fully deployed James Webb Space Telescope after it begins a decade-long mission in 2018 as Earth\u2019s primary observatory in space. NASA Move over, Hubble Telescope \u2015 there\u2019s a new BIG scope coming to town. When the $9 billion James Webb Space Telescope is launched in 2018, after two decades of planning and construction, it will bring the deepest and farthest reaches of the physical universe much closer to observers on Earth than anything previously could. In fact, it will take astronomers all the way back in time to the beginning of the physical universe. Advertisement Named after former NASA administrator James Webb, this next-generation telescope \u2015 generally referred to as JWST or Webb \u2015 \u201cwill study every phase in the history of our universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to watching galaxies collide, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth,\u201d according to a NASA statement. \u201cWe are opening up a whole new territory of astronomy. We will see things that we\u2019ve never been able to see before because this telescope is much more powerful than even the great Hubble Telescope,\u201d Nobel prize-winning NASA astrophysicist John Mather said in a statement. But wait! What about the Hubble Telescope ? Is it being junked or put out to very deep space pasture? After nearly three decades of photographing incredible outer space imagery, Hubble will continue that job, remaining near Earth. While Webb will be a much more powerful outer space observatory, it will not be close to Earth, where \u2015 as history has shown us \u2015 Hubble has required humans to make \u201con-site\u201d repairs to keep it functioning. Advertisement No, Webb will be on its own, in an orbit around the sun. Here\u2019s an illustration of the size difference between Hubble and Webb\u2019s imaging mirrors: This illustration shows the size difference, and therefore, imaging power ability between the Hubble and Webb telescopes. NASA Webb\u2019s primary mirror is made up of 18 hexagonal mirrors that look like a huge piece of a puzzle. These will unfold and take their permanent shape after the telescope is launched and assumes its solar orbit. The following Goddard Space Flight Center video highlights Webb\u2019s amazing technology. Advertisement Webb is made possible by a global effort including NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

Get The Thrill Of A Safari Without Ever Leaving Home Twice a day, viewers can travel live to the bush from the comfort of their living room. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 27, 2015, 06:59 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A WildEarth guide and cameraman film Karula, a female leopard, in the Djuma Game Reserve near Kruger National Park. Pieter Pretorius/WildEarth More than 8,000 miles from New York City, a team of a few dozen goes on safari every day, films everything they encounter and broadcasts the results live on the internet. The three-hour show starts at 5 a.m. local time near South Africa's Kruger National Park -- 10 p.m. eastern -- and is repeated again in the afternoon. One morning, viewers may spot a leopard sleeping in a marula tree , paws dangling over either side of a branch. A few minutes later, that same leopard may chow on an early breakfast, gulping down the ribcage of an impala she hoisted up to keep away from hyenas . Advertisement For the evening drive, that leopard may be gone, replaced by a herd of elephants, a termite mound or a southern masked weaver building its nest. Whatever the team at WildEarth stumble on that day, viewers see in realtime alongside commentary from experienced safari guides. Karula enjoys the remains of an impala, which she hoisted up into a tree. Pieter Pretorius/WildEarth The team, led by married couple Graham and Emily Wallington, has filmed from the Djuma Game Reserve , about 300 miles northeast of Johannesburg, for years. The reserve shares a border with Kruger -- South Africa's most famous national park -- and nearly all of the animals associated with a safari are there, including the Big Five . Advertisement The plan to broadcast live content began with a camera screwed into a tree above a watering hole in 1998 that would take a still image every 30 seconds or so. That camera, now in full video, still operates nearly two decades later -- albeit in a different tree after one was downed by a storm, another an elephant. The first live safari was broadcast in 2007 and has been running ever since. Two guides venture out twice daily in Land Rovers outfitted with a camera rig on the back. Another is out often on foot for a bush walk. Antennas strapped to the back of the vehicles (or a cameraman, if it's a walk) transmit the signal back to a control room on site or in Johannesburg, where it's fed directly online with no more than a few seconds' delay. Bush walks offer viewers a unique experience from the ground, but guides can find themselves in dangerous situations. Some carry rifles in case of emergency. Pieter Pretorius/WildEarth Advertisement About a thousand viewers are tuned in at any time -- many diehard fans watch daily -- and anyone can ask questions via Twitter in real time . How many spots does a leopard have? Do elephants get wrinklier over time? Tweet the control room and within minutes the guides will turn towards the camera and answer for you, using years of guiding experience, to explain that those spots are actually rosettes and that it depends on the cat. As with any live broadcast things can go wrong -- and they do. If it's cloudy, the antennas may not be able to broadcast their signal and the feed will cut out. Microphones can stop transmitting and if it rains too strongly (which it seldom does as South Africa's in a hardcore drought ), no safari. But the team expertly navigates many of these issues on the fly, and a guide on a bush walk can chat entertainingly for an hour about the different moths they stumble across should a vehicle get a thorn in a tire. All of this prep culminates the day after Thanksgiving, when WildEarth broadcasts its video feed directly to American homes on Nat Geo WILD, the exclusively animal cable affiliate of the magazine. This is the second year Graham and Emily Wallington's crew will host its show for an audience of millions -- and it can get exciting. Advertisement Last year, the cameras captured the birth of a wildebeest. Another broadcast saw a pack of wild dogs killing a pregnant impala in an extremely graphic, but very primal encounter that few had seen live. These are wild animals and there really is no telling what will or won't happen, or what. Big cats are elusive and a favored tree can be far from the reach of a Land Rover. But for those unable to venture to South Africa, the experience provides viewers with the real thrill of a game drive, where animals roam in their native habitats. Advertisement Graham Wallington said the live broadcasts provide a step above the reality shown on a nature documentary, where lions perform a half dozen kills in a few minutes. We all love to see the burst of action, but WildEarth's reality is a little more real -- and a pride may laze about for 20 hours a day, with the only action being a big male rolling onto his back in the sun. Even the team of experienced guides can't guarantee what'll happen, a very grounded fear for a crew ramping up for just its second cable broadcast. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Controversial Gene Editing Could Lead To Groundbreaking Cures This technology may change the way we think of some of the world's most challenging diseases. By Lila Shapiro Senior Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post Nov 28, 2015, 07:31 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The gene-editing technique CRISPR could lead to cures for serious diseases. Gregory Adams via Getty Images Thanks to the controversial new technology known as CRISPR, scientists are beginning to make headway in understanding and potentially curing some of the world's most intractable diseases. Sickle-cell anemia, HIV, schizophrenia and autism -- essentially, anything involving bad DNA is now fair game. The latest example, from a study published earlier this month in the journal Molecular Therapy, focuses on Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, which is one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy. The genetic disease causes the muscle fibers in the face, shoulders and upper arms to weaken over time -- and there is no known cure. Advertisement Enter CRISPR. This new gene-editing technique allows researchers to easily change, delete or replace genes in any plant or animal, including people. Picture the precision and ease of the find-and-replace function on a word document -- that\u2019s how easy it now is to change the human genome. As an article in the MIT Technology Review put it last year, \u201cThis means they can rewrite the human genome at will.\u201d Or, as one bioethicist told The Huffington Post last week, comparing what CRISPR can do to earlier attempts at genetic manipulation, \u201cWe used to have a butter knife, now we\u2019ve got a scalpel. \u201d Biomedical researchers all over the world are now wondering how the technology might change their approach to all sorts of diseases. About a year ago, a team of FSHD researchers, led by Peter Jones at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, decided to give CRISPR a try. They already had a pretty good idea which of the thousands of genes in the human genome caused the disease, but until CRISPR came along therapeutic avenues were limited. The acronym CRISPR, which stands for (take a deep breath) \u201cclusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,\u201d refers to both a technique and an actual thing, which is a macromolecular complex. The complex consists of a mix of two different types of biological material, protein and RNA. The RNA seeks out and binds to the targeted gene, like a hunting dog chasing down a fox, and the protein goes to work on it -- the hunter firing a shot. Advertisement Why would someone want to hunt down a gene? There\u2019s no one answer to that question. Bad genes are like Tolstoy\u2019s unhappy families -- they\u2019re all bad in different ways. Sometimes a mutated gene doesn\u2019t make the protein it\u2019s supposed to make. When that\u2019s the case, CRISPR can be used to replace this lazy gene with one that actually does its job. Other times, the gene isn\u2019t lazy, if you will, but is actively malicious -- it makes a protein that it\u2019s not supposed to make, a toxin. That\u2019s the story with FSHD. The U. Mass team figured they\u2019d try to use CRISPR to shut down the gene, to \u201cturn it off.\u201d Until they got started on this study, no one had ever proved that CRISPR could be used to turn off a human disease gene, and the U. Mass researchers themselves weren\u2019t sure it would work. Well, it did. The implications of this are pretty huge. The research could pave the way for other valuable studies, according to Charis Himeda, the lead author on the study. \u201cI think progress for any disease is really progress for all diseases, because a lot of these therapies and technologies are going to turn out to be broadly applicable,\u201d she said. Advertisement It\u2019s important, however, not to get carried away. Himeda said she didn\u2019t know specifically which other diseases could possibly be cured as a result of CRISPR inhibition, and she thinks it\u2019s too soon to start testing any of the CRISPR techniques on people. \u2018I think there\u2019s reason to be really hopeful that some day it\u2019ll actually lead to great therapies for genetic diseases as long as we\u2019re not too eager to get this to the clinic right away,\u201d she said. Himeda\u2019s use of CRISPR may be less risky than some of the other potential therapies. Replacing bad genes, as other scientists have done, involves cutting away pieces of DNA. To simply stop them from making stuff, as the U. Mass team has done, is less likely to cause the genes any permanent damage. But that doesn\u2019t mean the technique is risk-free. Himeda points out that while they achieved a 50 percent reduction in expression of the FSHD disease gene, we still don\u2019t know what the effects are on all the other genes in a cell. \u201cThere are things that we don\u2019t understand yet that we need to characterize before we move forward,\u201d Himeda said. There\u2019s a bigger ethical question at play here, too. Many people think it\u2019s simply a bad idea to meddle with the human genome, no matter what technique you use or how good your intentions are. The fact that CRISPR is so easy to use makes it especially frightening. What happens if it ends up in the wrong hands? If sci-fi has taught us anything, it\u2019s that it won\u2019t end well. Think the 1997 futuristic thriller \"Gattaca,\" where some children are conceived through genetic engineering to ensure a perfect -- and disease-free -- life, while others, known as \"in-valids,\" are relegated to a brutal existence of menial labor. Advertisement Even Himeda worries about that. \u201cPeople talk about it as a great tool, and it\u2019s promising, but it\u2019s also scary,\u201d she noted. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready for \u2018Gattaca.\u2019\u201d Related coverage: * This Technology Can Fight Cancer And Create Adorable Mini Pigs.

Why It Should Always Be the Season for Exercise We all know that exercise is good for us. And this past holiday season, the market was awash with activity monitors like the FitBit and Nike Fuel Band to help you reach your fitness goals from the neck down. But what about from the neck up?

And this past holiday season, the market was awash with activity monitors like the FitBit and Nike Fuel Band to help you reach your fitness goals from the neck down. But what about from the neck up? Although it may come as no surprise that exercise is good for your brain, we still do not have the metrics to guide optimal exercise for mental health. Today, the most common explanations for how exercise boosts mental health are that when we exercise we release endorphins that make us feel good and that exercise increases blood flow to our brains. Another explanation is that when we become more \"physically fit,\" our brains become more fit. But the truth is that scientists still cannot fully explain the numerous mental health benefits of exercise. If we can't explain it, we don't know how to suggest the best types of exercise for your brain or how often you should do them, and we don't know how to biologically mimic exercise when it's not possible. The good news is that research from our team and others continues to make progress in understanding the connection between exercise and mental health. Advertisement Take, for example, the \"super\" protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). BDNF is thought of as a \"super\" protein because it seems to improve our brain's plasticity -- how it can change and adapt -- and the ability to repair itself following injuries. Researchers have found that muscle contractions that occur with exercise release antioxidants and other molecules into our blood circulation that interact with the brain and can potentially increase the presence of BDNF in the brain. Although scientists have yet to fully map out how BDNF communicates between the body and the brain, numerous studies have documented that blocking BDNF signaling in the brain also blocks positive effects of exercise on learning and memory. From animal studies, we know these effects occur in a brain region called the hippocampus, which is a brain region that is critical for many types of learning and memory. However, we don't know if the same happens in humans. This will be important to find out: While on average the hippocampus starts to shrink at around age 60 and does so more dramatically for those who end up developing dementia in older age, it is possible the right dose of exercise-induced BDNF could help delay these age-related declines. Advertisement We also know through several studies that exercise results in almost immediate increases in BDNF expression in the brain, with researchers finding higher levels of BDNF in animals within the first hour of exercise and following just several days of running. These findings suggest the rise in BDNF likely plays a role in improved mental health, in addition to changes in physical fitness or blood flow in certain regions of the brain that likely require a more sustained exercise routine. Our team is working to connect how these quick exercise-related changes in BDNF in the periphery (e.g., muscle, blood) and in the brain relate to the long-term benefits of exercise on mental health. If we can figure out the guiding principles of how exercise promotes improved brain health, and can translate them to humans, then we can optimize its benefit at the individual level and across the lifespan. Indeed, the power of exercise is that it naturally elicits a powerful regenerative response throughout many systems in the body that otherwise would suffer from the effects of aging or neurological disease. Anyone who has seen the ravages of dementia or brain injury knows that we must treat our brains with care; its degeneration or injury can change the very nature of who we are, and many times we would do anything to just be ourselves again. As we continue to explore how best to delay or possibly prevent brain disease and injury, it's important to reflect on the many things we don't know. This includes understanding differences in how exercise affects the aging versus the developing brain, and differences between healthy adults and people fighting neurological disease. Knowing this information would be the first step in integrating brain health into accessible activity monitors. Advertisement And finally, we want to understand how long you can be inactive before the positive benefits of exercise start to diminish. For example, we know that you can lose much of your training gains on physical fitness with about two to three weeks of inactivity. Does the same timescale generalize to brain benefits? So while we don't yet know exactly what guideline to suggest for exercising for brain health, we are getting closer. The federal government suggests 150 minutes a week of exercise that gets your heart rate up for improved overall health, and on average, studies support that this may improve brain and mental health too. But we still know very little about whether this is the optimal dose of exercise for brain health for different populations and exactly how the effects occur. Our research team and others will continue to work on these problems. In the meantime, we know that something is better than nothing. So, grab your favorite activity monitor and get moving: your brain will thank you. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Europe's 'Oldest Living Inhabitant' Is Looking Pretty Darn Good That inhabitant happens to be a tree. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Aug 20, 2016, 03:37 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING \u201c Another story about something old?\u201d you might be thinking. \u201cWasn\u2019t there a story about a really old shark just last week?\u201d But bear with us, and stop being so ageist. This tree is pretty cool. The Bosnian pine, found in the highlands of northern Greece , is more than 1,075 years old, according to a Friday news release from Sweden\u2019s Stockholm University. The tree was discovered by a group of researchers from Stockholm University, the University of Mainz in Germany and the University of Arizona in the U.S. Advertisement This tree is more than 1,075 years young. Dr. Oliver Konter, Mainz \u201cIn our research, we try to build long chronologies to construct climate histories, so finding living trees of old age is one of our motivations,\u201d Swedish dendrochronologist (read: someone who studies tree rings) and expedition leader Paul J. Krusic said in the release. To determine the tree\u2019s age, the researchers had to remove a core of wood from inside the tree in order to count growth rings, but this process isn\u2019t harmful to the tree. They also didn\u2019t reach the center of the tree, which means there are still more rings that were uncounted, Krusic told The Washington Post. That\u2019s why the researchers describe the tree as being \u201cmore than\u201d 1,075 years old. Advertisement Dr Oliver Konter, Mainz And while this particular tree is hogging a lot of the media spotlight, Krusic told WaPo it\u2019s surrounded by other trees that all hover in age around 1,000 years old. The scientists are calling the tree the \u201coldest living inhabitant in Europe.\u201d That might be confusing for people who have heard about other trees in Europe that are even older, like Old Tjikko , a spruce tree that\u2019s often touted as being the \u201coldest living tree\u201d in the world, at more than 9,000 years old. Advertisement The difference is that Old Tjikko and some other famously old trees are what are known as \u201cclonal\u201d trees, which means that the tree repeatedly reproduces asexually by cloning itself. In Old Tjikko\u2019s case, this means that the spruce tree\u2019s trunk is actually only a few hundred years old, but after each trunk dies, \u201ca new one emerges from the same root stock,\u201d Swedish ecology professor Leif Kullman told National Geographic. In the case of the Bosnian pine, on the other hand, the entire tree, trunk included, is more than 1,075 years old, making it the oldest non-clonal tree (that we know of) in Europe. The title of oldest known non-clonal tree in the world goes to a bristlecone pine called Methuselah in California that\u2019s around 4,800 years old. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Riding the Evolution Paradigm Shift With Eugene Koonin Eugene Koonin is director of the Evolutionary Genomics Group at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland, as well as its senior investigator. He is also senior investigator at the National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health.

Eugene Koonin is director of the Evolutionary Genomics Group at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland, as well as its senior investigator. He is also senior investigator at the National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health. Koonin specializes in comparative genetics. Among his research interests are the origin and evolution of viruses, horizontal gene transfer, and the general principles of evolution. He is the author of The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution (FT Press); and author or co-author of 600 scientific papers. Advertisement Highlights of our recent conversation about evolution paradigm shift and his above interests follow. Suzan Mazur : What are the dangers to human health and life on the planet if the power structure continues to refuse to recognize that an evolution paradigm shift has been happening or has happened? Eugene Koonin : I would speak more about regrettably missed opportunities and investments in not so fruitful directions rather than danger... [S]erious medicine, mainstream medicine these days indeed, I think, over-appreciates the directness of the link between the genome and phenotypes and under-appreciates the emergent properties of the phenotype. [T]he entire ideology of personalized medicine should be taken with many grains of salt. It's not useless, it's useful to sequence thousands of genomes. It's useful to sequence everyone's genome. It's useful and desirable -- yet, it's wrong and to some degree dangerous to think that, by peering into the sequence of the A, G, T, and Cs in your genome, your family doctor is going to tell you how to treat all your conditions and what conditions you are going to develop, and which ones you are not going to develop, and so on. Many people in the public think so, quite a few doctors think something like that, although a lesser fraction than the general public. This view is a waste and gets to the point of being ridiculous. Suzan Mazur : Do you view origin of life as a separate event from evolution? Eugene Koonin : [I]f we assume that the origin of life depended on the emergence of the replication of information, that's some sort of beginning. There should have been something before that point that does not deserve to be called life. One can have different ideas on that account... Suzan Mazur : You've said you think faint signals remain in tracing early ancestry. Carl Woese told me that these things are simply being inferred, that there's no way to know... Eugene Koonin : Indeed, if you want to be rigorous in a way, there is nothing we can know about the past. Everything we're saying about the past is inference -- yet, inference is not a derogatory term. We are very confident about much of this inference. We are confident that all animals had a common ancestor about 700 million years ago, a little less. Although, do we know that? No. And no one ever is going to find that ancestor and experiment on that ancestor. In that sense, we do not know that. Do we have doubts? No. Reasonable evolutionary biologists have no doubts about that. Then we go further into the past. The level of confidence drops. Yet, I would say responsibly, that there are quite a few things that we can infer with confidence about the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all existing cells. That's pretty deep. Then, there are things that we can infer with reasonable confidence about some of the things that clearly happened before that Last Universal Common Ancestor of all modern cells existed by comparing those genes that were already present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor. Is it lost somewhere? Absolutely. Of course. The question is, we discussed that boundary between pre-life and life. And that boundary is the emergence of replication of information carriers, such as nucleic acids. So the question is, do we lose all traceability of evolution at that boundary or later? If we lose the trace at that boundary, there is nothing to be done about it. We have done what we can by comparing and analyzing components of modern living things. If, on the other hand, there was a period of time when replication already existed but we can make no inferences about that -- that's a bit of a different matter. Then it's worth trying more, trying harder... Suzan Mazur : I'd like to touch on lateral transfer of information in microbial evolution and the growing interest in the influence of microbial evolution in human and animal evolution... Eugene Koonin : Yes, of course, microbiota is found not only in humans but in all multicellular organisms, which only exist as symbiotic communities with the microbiota, their respective microbiomes. By the way, the microbiomes themselves to some extent are transmitted vertically, but only to some extent... Suzan Mazur : Do you see viruses as alive? For instance, the way they insert themselves into animal cells. This sounds like an active process. That they're trying to sustain themselves by entering the cell. Eugene Koonin : By every account, viruses are organisms. They are active agents. They have their own evolution. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Suzan Mazur : But all of these things we've been discussing have been pretty much left out of the Modern Synthesis. Advertisement Eugene Koonin : This is a good point to make. The entire evolution of the microbial world and the virus world, and the interaction between microbes and viruses and other life forms have been left out of the Modern Synthesis... So indeed, the new understanding of evolution needs to integrate what we now know about viruses and virus-host interactions which, from my own perspective, has been absolutely one of the key factors of all evolution since the emergence of cells -- well, actually even before the emergence of cells.

Why A Giant Green Lake Turned Blood-Red The salty waters of Iran\u2019s Lake Urmia recently morphed from a deep green to a rich red, likely due to algae and bacteria blooms. Elaina Zachos \u2014 National Geographic Aug 8, 2016, 10:33 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This post originally appeared on National Geographic. Bloody Transformation: The waters of Lake Urmia changed from green on April 23 to red on July 18, as seen by a NASA satellite. PHOTOGRAPH BY NASA EARTH OBSERVATORY Like the famous Aral Sea between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and the Salton Sea in California, the salty expanse of Lake Urmia in Iran has been drying up and shrinking for decades. Now the lake, once one of the largest in the Middle East, looks more like a gigantic crime scene. In late April, NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite captured Lake Urmia with a deep green hue . But as of mid-July, the body of water was filled with algae and bacteria that turned it into a stained red pool. Drought, heat, and increased demand for irrigation water have been steadily shrinking the salty lake in northern Iran near the Turkish border. As the lake dries out, its salinity increases. The warm water\u2019s high salt concentration makes what\u2019s left of the lake a prime breeding ground for Dunaliella algae, which can turn the water blood-red. \u201cIn the marine environment, Dunaliella salina appears green,\u201d Mohammad Tourian, a scientist at the University of Stuttgart, tells NASA . \u201cHowever, in conditions of high salinity and light intensity, the micro-algae turns red due to the production of protective carotenoids in the cells.\u201d Close-Up. The waters surrounding the Lake Urmia bridge shifted from green on April 20 to red by July 9.

The waters surrounding the Lake Urmia bridge shifted from green on April 20 to red by July 9. PHOTOGRAPH BY NASA EARTH OBSERVATORY Advertisement A family of bacteria called Halobacteriaceae may also play a role: These salt-loving organisms use a red pigment to absorb sunlight and convert it into energy, so large amounts of them in the water may be contributing to the ruddy hue. Lake Urmia\u2019s color-changing process has happened before. Spring rains and melting snow from nearby mountains normally wash freshwater into Lake Urmia, helping to stabilize its salinity and thus its color. But as drought and agricultural use persist in the region, red waters may become a more common sight. Based on satellite observations, Lake Urmia has lost about 70 percent of its surface area in the past 14 years. Sharp, white salt crystals left behind by evaporation now surround the shrinking rust-colored pool, driving away tourists and migratory birds. The lake was once one of the world\u2019s largest brine shrimp habitats, but water loss and higher salinity are cutting into their growth and reproduction. \u201cIf land use and water consumption remain as it is now, then the lake would disappear pretty soon,\u201d Hossein Akhani, a biologist at the University of Tehran, tells Scientific American . \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d Follow Elaina Zachos on Twitter .

Top 10 Medical Research Issues and Trends to Watch in 2015 Academic research institutions are undeniably under duress. While some of it may be due to overbuilding research infrastructure during the years of doubling the National Institutes of Health budget, they are now dealing with a new normal of having to do more with less. By Margaret Anderson, Contributor Executive Director, FasterCures, a center of the Milken Institute Executive Director, FasterCures, a center of the Milken Institute Jan 15, 2015, 10:42 AM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

At FasterCures , we are always thinking about ways to innovate the medical research system so that better treatments and cures get to patients faster. Read below to find out the top 10 issues and trends that we are watching this year: Crossing the aisle for cures. Kicking off 2015 will likely be the release of a draft of the 21st Century Cures legislation the U.S. House Energy & Commerce Committee has been developing under the leadership of Chairman Fred Upton and Representative Diana DeGette. The process itself has been a rare bright spot of comity and bipartisanship in the Congress, and a positive undertaking by members and staff to address a number of the entrenched systemic challenges in medical research that have become status quo. Will it make it through the wringer that it takes for an idea to become a bill and then a law? Perhaps, if patient groups and advocates like what they see and encourage their members to move it along. PDUFA VI: Regulations for patients? Also kicking off in 2015 will be the process of discussions leading to a new Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) , due to be passed in 2017. PDUFA V introduced some important initiatives to improve the regulatory process; what add-ons will the new round of negotiations bring? We'll be looking for continued improvement in the patient-focused drug development process that began with PDUFA V (specifically the inclusion of patient perspective in the assessment of desired benefits and tolerable risks, not just the understanding of disease and adequacy of existing treatments), a commitment to the sustainability of existing accelerated approval mechanisms like \" breakthrough therapy designation ,\" and more focus on the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulatory science needs . Advertisement Making the value case for new therapies. There was plenty of good news in FDA's unofficial year-end report , beginning with the fact that FDA approved a record 41 new drugs and biologics in 2014, the most since 1996, giving new options and hope to millions of patients. This included the highest number of orphan drugs and new biologics ever approved in one year, and 43 percent of new approvals were first-in-class drugs. While these numbers seem to bode well for the state of innovation - FasterCures ' Senior Fellow Bernard Munos suggested earlier this month that we are on the cusp of a hyper-innovation age - how will the payer marketplace react? There may be a lot of very costly new drugs coming at us. Forbes's Matt Herper noted that the most important immunotherapy drugs just approved will carry price tags of $150,000 per patient per year. How will the value these new therapies deliver to patients be defined and evaluated? There is wide agreement that the current paradigm of uncertainty about how innovation will be paid for cannot be sustained, but will stakeholders be willing to align their interests with those of patients? Advancing the science of patient input . Will 2015 be the year we all move beyond lip-service to \"patient-centeredness\" and start building the science around patient-reported outcomes, benefit-risk, and value and coverage - in partnership with patients rather than on their behalf? More and more people are paying attention now, from regulators to industry to payers to academics. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health are leading the way to incentivize patient-centered approaches to clinical effectiveness research and medical device design and regulation. Capacity-building in the patient community is needed too, so that patients and patient organizations are prepared to generate the right data and provide robust, meaningful input other stakeholders need to inform their decision-making. A vehicle is needed for moving this agenda forward; who will lead the charge? Venture philanthropy really pays off. Undoubtedly there will be a frenzy of new or intensified interest among foundations in \"venture philanthropy\" with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's $3.3 billion payout from its investment in Vertex Pharmaceuticals - a game-changing return that the foundation will continue to invest in the future of cystic fibrosis research. This is proof-of-concept on a mammoth scale of the patient-driven R&D model, in which patients and patient groups provide not only funding but also patient data, insight into patient populations, patient participation in trials, and more to incentivize and drive the process in academia and industry. The philosophy - and commitment to it - goes way beyond inserting revenue-sharing provisions in funding agreements. Dozens of other foundations - from the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research to the Alpha-1 Foundation and many more - are doing whatever it takes to move good ideas from the lab bench to the patients they care about and bringing all the partners they need to the table to make it happen. We expect to see more foundations pursuing that model in earnest in 2015 and more researchers and companies being very willing to partner. Advertisement The emergence of debt as a financing mechanism for medical R&D. Medical research has lagged behind other sectors in the creation and application of novel financing methods to address market failures. However, new energy and focus around advancing different types of debt instruments are bringing new sources of capital to the table, particularly in the early stages of R&D. Social impact bonds, which are being employed in other fields of social need, are beginning to be discussed and deployed in the health space as well (with the leading edge in prevention and wellness, more so than new treatments). New York state has proposed issuing bonds to support Alzheimer's research, and some disease foundations are proposing doing the same in their own fields, such as the Foundation Fighting Blindness' Eye-Bond that would raise funding for blindness disorders through debt with a limited federal guarantee. There is also a debt component to the \" megafund \" concept proposed by MIT professor and Milken Institute Senior Fellow Andrew Lo, which has been attracting much attention over the last year or so. In 2013, the U.S. bond market was $40 trillion compared to $193 billion of venture capital investment, so there could be significant opportunity to tap into this investor base for life sciences R&D. We'll be following closely to see how these tools find a place in the flow of funds. Measuring effective collaboration. Collaboration has always been a focus for us at FasterCures because the complexities and risks of medical research require cross-sector, cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional partnerships to advance progress for all. The rapid growth over the last few years of collaborative research consortia would seem to indicate that stakeholders see value in these initiatives despite the challenges of creating, managing, and sustaining them. The good news is opportunities for such collaboration are growing. The bad news is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to know which are the best opportunities to take. With research-by-consortia taking off, watch for efforts to develop new frameworks and metrics for establishing and evaluating these efforts. Future of academic research. Academic research institutions are undeniably under duress. While some of it may be due to overbuilding research infrastructure during the years of doubling the National Institutes of Health budget, they are now dealing with a new normal of having to do more with less. There have been blue-ribbon commissions and white papers paying homage to the value these institutions create in terms of health and economic well-being. With pressures on tuition, grants, and reimbursement for healthcare delivery, it feels like time for a serious analysis of how they will be able to sustain their critical mission of research, alongside equally critical missions of education, training, and care going forward. Efforts to increase funding for NIH still matter greatly, the question is how that case will be made effectively on Capitol Hill in the years ahead. Personal health data in R&D. It finally feels like we're at a tipping point with regards to the ability of personal and mobile health data to be transformational in healthcare and research. (Just check out the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.) The technology is there, entrepreneurs are less scared off by the regulated nature of the industry, and FDA is getting more comfortable with the technologies. A recent initiative between GlaxoSmithKline and Medidata generated 18 million FDA-compliant data points, and a wave of mobile-enabled trials seems imminent. Could this also mark a turning point in patient/consumer empowerment? As individuals generate, possess, and contribute this valuable asset, will they demand access to the rest of their personal health information as well? If so, how will it be used by the individual and the health systems they interact with to deliver on the promise of better health? Understanding what's really escalating drug development costs. The Tufts Center for Drug Development has updated its estimate of the cost of developing a single approved drug to almost $2.6 billion. Whether or not you completely buy into their analysis, suffice it to say the costs are not going down but continue to increase dramatically. We were interested to note that in their analysis the time of development has actually declined and is having a mitigating effect on cost increases. We'd like to see in 2015 some further analysis of what the cost drivers actually are and whether industry and policymakers are targeting efforts at tackling those drivers directly. Both the 21st Century Cures initiative and PDUFA VI discussions are good steps toward identifying the policy fixes needed.

Clever Monkey Demonstrates The Proper Way To Crack A Nut WATCH: Clever Monkey Demonstrates The Proper Way To Crack A Nut By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 2, 2015, 09:59 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT When it comes to cracking nuts, capuchins don't monkey around. Just have a look at this video showing a little monkey named Jatob\u00e1 expertly crack a tucum nut . Five quick whacks, and voila! The video was taken as part of a new study on wild-bearded capuchins (Cebus libidinosus) living in the open woodland of Piaui, Brazil . Advertisement \"Until now, this level of dexterity was not suspected of any monkey,\" Madhur Mangalam, a psychology graduate student at the University of Georgia at Athens and one of the researchers involved in the study, said in a written statement. For the study, Mangalam and her colleagues recorded 14 capuchins cracking nuts with a stone \"hammer,\" and then analyzed the videos to determine the force of each strike. To their surprise, the scientists found that the monkeys don't simply whack a nut over and over until it breaks open. Instead, they monkeys examine the nut after each strike and artfully adjust the amount of force they use -- so as to save their energy and prevent the nut's kernel from getting smashed. \"It was a 'eureka' moment when we realized that the monkeys modulated the strikes systematically according to the condition of the nut following the preceding strike,\" Mangalam said in the statement. Advertisement It's not the first time scientists have been impressed by monkeys' abilities. Previous research showed that monkeys can do math and even learn to spend money . A paper describing the research was published on April 29 in the journal Current Biology .

National Geographic Aug 15, 2016, 03:56 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Each of the following stunning photos has been featured in National Geographic\u2019s \u201cExtreme Photo of the Week\u201d series this year. Armchair adventurers, rejoice! Climbing During a Blizzard in Rocky Mountain National Park Photograph by John Dickey \u201cThe conditions were some of the worst I have ever shot in,\u201d says photographer John Dickey , who took this image of climbers Bruce Miller , in front, and Kevin Cooper on Mount Meeker in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park. \u201cThe spindrift was constant and so heavy at times that it was difficult to breathe,\u201d he says. Dickey is no neophyte when it comes to shooting in winter conditions: He is currently working on a film about the evolution of winter climbing in the park and the environment\u2019s role in the sport. But even this seasoned photographer was getting scared. \u201cIt seemed as if a costly mistake was inevitable,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI could have never expected conditions to get that bad [in November], and had to slow things down to be as clear and deliberate as possible. \"Fortunately,\" Dickey says, \u201ceveryone stayed on their toes and the climbers were rock solid. We made our way up and out slowly but surely.\u201d Record-Setting Paragliding Traverse of the Alaska Range Photograph by Jody MacDonald \u201cI was incredibly focused on flying well, as we needed to stay in the air and make distance,\u201d says Gavin McClurg, pictured here during the first ever traverse of the Alaska Range by foot and paraglider. \u201cThis had been a dream of mine for six years\u2014to fly across the most remote and iconic mountains in North America.\u201d The attempt didn\u2019t start out well, however. Bad weather kept McClurg and his expedition partner, Dave Turner, pinned down in their tents for more than a week before being able to get airborne. But finally, \u201csome of the clouds cleared and I had a perfect view of Denali, the highest mountain in North America,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like we were pulling off something completely absurd and really special, and not likely to be repeated for a long time. In short, I was totally blown away.\u201d Photographer Jody MacDonald, who shot this image of McClurg flying past Mount Foraker and Mount Denali, about 37 miles into his 124-mile route over Denali National Park, was just as excited. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure for them to fly as far as they could through the park,\u201d she says, because they weren\u2019t allowed to land or take off anywhere inside the park. \u201cThe clouds were developing more and more by the minute, but they were able to fly around the clouds against an unbelievable background.\u201d MacDonald says that McClurg\u2019s dream of making the traverse was the result of careful planning and ambition. \u201cThere have been only two other documented traverses: one by foot, and one by foot and pack raft. Paragliding in the Alaska Range had never been done, and traversing the entire range, from one extreme end to the other, was pretty audacious.\u201d About halfway through the expedition, Turner and an accompanying film crew departed, leaving McClurg completely alone and facing miles of bushwhacking through dangerous terrain toward his goal. \u201cThe closest call during this section was crossing the Gakona River, which comes out of the Gakona Glacier. I had to forge 10 miles upriver along the banks, following a grizzly trail, because the river was much too deep and fast to cross on foot,\u201d he says. Eventually he crossed via an ice bridge, \u201cbut the footing, due to the hard ice and talus, was treacherous. One slip and I would have plummeted several hundred feet into the icy river and had very little chance of survival.\u201d Thirty-seven days after launching his attempt, McClurg completed the traverse without any serious injuries. \u201cHis vision and determination to make this happen and suffer it out was amazing to witness,\u201d MacDonald says. McClurg adds: \u201cEven on the really physical or scary days, life was so wonderfully simple. You wake up, you eat and have coffee, and then your whole job for the day is just to stay alive.\u201d Photographing Surfers From Under the Waves at Teahupoo, Tahiti Photograph by Ben Thouard \u201cThe surface of the ocean was like perfect glass, and was perfect for shooting underwater,\u201d says photographer Ben Thouard of his image of surfer Landon McNamara riding a wave in Teahupoo, Tahiti. \u201cI had been trying to get this shot for some time without much success. When I saw the wave coming, I dove under and turned back to look from behind the wave. The sun was coming from right through the lip of the wave, and I knew that I wanted to catch the surfer coming through the light,\u201d he says. Factors beyond his control came together to make the picture work, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that I get impeccable water clarity, no wind, good waves, and light all in one frame. The result ended up being pretty amazing!\u201d Thouard adds that, after spending his entire day underwater and shooting from below the surface, he had no idea who the surfer in this shot was. \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to check the pictures until I got home,\u201d he says. \u201cBut thanks to social media, a year later, I was able to identify Landon in the photo.\u201d Advertisement Bouldering in the Buttermilks, California Photograph by Fred Pompermayer \u201cI had no idea what to expect from this experience,\u201d says rock climber Eduardo Carvalho of this nighttime image by his friend, photographer Fred Pompermayer . It was shot under the Milky Way at the Buttermilks in Bishop, California. The two chose a line with solid holds on the Grandma Peabody boulder so Carvalho could hang on when the Milky Way hit its highest point in the sky at 3:20 a.m. \u201cAll I could think was to stay as still as possible, knowing how important this was to get the image he had in mind,\u201d Carvalho says. Nailing this image was a team effort, Pompermayer says. \u201cAs a photographer, I am constantly coming up with ideas to produce inspiring and exciting images. It can be hard to find people that are excited about your vision and want to help make it happen. Not everyone is willing to wake up in the middle of the night to go bouldering, and then sit tight for a 13-second exposure over and over again.\u201d After the first few test shots, Pompermayer recalls, \u201ceveryone got superstoked with the results, and it kept improving until we got the perfect lighting.\u201d Carvalho says the thing he loves most about climbing, besides working in beautiful places, is \u201cthe physical and mental challenges that allow me to grow and gain strength\u2014and sharing these experiences with friends.\u201d Wakeskating on a Remote Lake in Slovakia Photograph by Jan Kasl \u201cIt was a little crazy wakeskating this gap\u2014it was about a 12-foot gap with a 10-foot hole down to where Jan was taking the photo,\u201d says professional wakeskater Ben Horan about this shot by photographer Jan Kasl . \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t want to end up down there at 21 miles per hour!\u201d Horan pulled a varial flip over the large concrete hole at a remote lake in Slovakia while Kasl stood in ankle-deep mud to get the impressive angle. \u201cOnce the winch was set, guys started pulling huge tricks over the hole. It was late afternoon and light conditions were pretty good, but not from the inside of the hole. So I added one flash right above my head, which lit the rider and the slimy algae that covered the walls,\u201d Kasl says. Horan, Kasl, and the rest of their team had spent 10 days traveling around the Czech Republic and Slovakia searching out great shots across the countryside. They found this locale on the last day of the trip. \u201cI was already pretty happy with all the photos I had made so far, but we decided to check one more location, and that was where we found this amazing place,\u201d Kasl says. Horan says he would love to winch more untouched spots like this one. \u201cThere is something about being on a board where your feet are not attached, and you have the freedom to shove the board around and do tricks.\u201d Kayaking Over Spirit Falls in Washington State Photograph by Krystle Wright \u201cI swear my index finger was sweating from nerves,\u201d says photographer Krystle Wright of this photograph, which she took using a drone with two flashes connected to it, of kayaker Rush Sturges as he dropped off Spirit Falls in White Salmon, Washington. \u201cBut when Rush came over the falls and rolled the kayak, I knew as soon as I pressed the shutter that I had nailed an awesome shot and something that was different [from] anything that I've tried in the past.\u201d The shoot at Spirit Falls was intended to be a test run before trying the same setup later at Hamma Hamma Falls, but this \u201cpure experiment\u201d was all Wright needed. \u201cTurns out, I [got] the shot on the first evening. Perhaps having the mind-set of no pressure allowed me to be more relaxed and allow the shot to happen,\u201d she says. Even in her mellow state of mind, Wright was all business. \u201cI had challenged myself to nail each run in one shot so that I could keep the ISO down as much as possible. It's an interesting challenge to take away the high frame rate and really choose my moment, rather than spraying shots and hoping for the best.\" As a photographer and artist, I want and need to be challenged so that I can continue to evolve and try new things even if it means trying something new and failing,\u201d she adds. \u201cThankfully, this time around, I was able to come out with a successful photo.\u201d Advertisement Kayaking at Night in the Canadian Rockies Photograph by Paul Zizka \u201cWorking alone and out in remote locations is always time-consuming, and it involves a lot of back and forth to get the shot,\u201d says Paul Zizka of this self-portrait he took in a kayak on Goat Lake in the Canadian Rockies. \u201cI had been planning on visiting this location for some time, and on this night the conditions were perfect. The stars danced across the surface of the lake, and it felt like I was gliding through the night sky.\u201d Shooting a self-portrait at night isn\u2019t without its challenges, Zizka says. Keeping yourself still enough in a kayak so the camera can catch a sharp exposure is particularly daunting. \u201cI propped the kayak on top of a rock to help stabilize it once I was in the frame. It took a few tries, but eventually I got a frame with sharp focus that I could be happy with.\u201d Kayaking Over Celestial Falls, White River, Oregon Photograph by Tyler Roemer \u201cWith most action photography, I feel that I only have a couple chances to make the photo work to tell the story,\u201d says photographer Tyler Roemer , who took this mid-winter photo of kayaker Christie G. Eastman preparing to paddle off Celestial Falls on the White River in Oregon. \u201cWith the roaring of the water, communication between Christie, the other boaters, and me was down to nothing. To get in position, I perched on a ledge that was directly across from the falls\u2019 line of sight. Access was easy for me, but more challenging for the kayakers,\u201d Roemer says. Eastman, meanwhile, was warming up in the pool above the falls and lining up her kayak with the spout of the waterfall to ensure a clean plunge. \u201cIt can be difficult to see from upstream,\u201d she says. Eastman was able to execute the icy maneuver, but the drop-off by another member of Roemer\u2019s team didn\u2019t go as planned. That boater \u201cmisread the water slightly, which sent him into an over-rotation and an improper landing. He injured his arm, and he had to eject out of his boat to swim to the safety of the shore,\u201d Roemer says. Despite the small setback, Roemer calls the trip a success. \u201cI love being witness to scenes that unfold in front of the lens like this, especially when everyone walks away with a smile on their face.\u201d More from National Geographic : The Art Of Solar Energy 272-Year-Old Shark Is Longest-Lived Vertebrate on Earth Not-So-Dark Ages Revealed at King Arthur Site Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Hard Work, Hard Times: Self-control and Joblessness Does self-discipline today really pay off later in life -- in jobs, paychecks, promotions and bonuses, professional prestige and wealth? Surprisingly, given the importance of employment to well-being and the global economy, the link between self-control and job success has not been thoroughly studied. Until now. By Wray Herbert, Contributor Author, 'On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits' Author, 'On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits' Jan 21, 2015, 08:51 AM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Yes, sugary snacks do taste good, but even so, we shouldn't eat them too often. Yes, we know that math homework may not always be fun, but it must come before TV. Yes, soccer practice may seem tedious, but it's the road to excellence on the field and beyond. And so forth. No parent disputes this. It's in the manual. Indeed, we're all expected to take this life lesson on faith. Hard work and effort are virtues worth instilling, and worth having. But what do we mean by \"worth\"? Does self-discipline today really pay off later in life -- in jobs, paychecks, promotions and bonuses, professional prestige and wealth? Surprisingly, given the importance of employment to well-being and the global economy, the link between self-control and job success has not been thoroughly studied. Advertisement Until now. Psychological scientist Michael Daly of the University of Stirling, UK, and his colleagues have, for the first time, been investigating the link between childhood self-discipline and job success in adulthood. The benefits of self-control in a work setting seem readily apparent. Ignoring distractions, perseverance in the face of difficulty, conscientiousness in general -- these traits all make for good workers. Daly and colleagues wanted to see if these benefits begin to accrue early in life and persist into and throughout adulthood. To test this, the scientists turned to two existing British cohort studies, which followed a total of more than 15,000 subjects over many decades. The first, the British Cohort Study, has followed children born in Britain during a single week in 1970. Attention and perseverance are considered key components of overall self-control in childhood, so teachers evaluated the kids at age 10 with various measures of such traits: \"Cannot concentrate on a particular task,\" \"Shows perseverance,\" \"Pays attention in class,\" and so forth. The study followed these youngsters as they grew up, keeping track of their work life from age 21 to age 42. The scientists noted the subjects' employment (or unemployment) status at several points during these years, and they also computed total months of accumulated unemployment over these prime working years. They crunched the data together to see how childhood self-control predicted -- or not -- adult work history. Advertisement The results were clear. Children with low self-control at age 10 were more likely to be out of work at ages 21, 26, 30 and 42, and they had more accumulated months of unemployment over time. Indeed, childhood self-control was equal to or better than intelligence in predicting employment in adulthood. The findings were robust, but the scientists wanted more proof, so they analyzed data from a second study, the British National Child Development Study, which focused on babies born in 1958. The study included extensive measures of early childhood environment and personal characteristics and did follow-ups of the subjects at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, 42, 46 and 50. At the adult follow-ups, the scientists noted job status, and they measured total unemployment over the period from 1974 to 2008. The results, reported in a forthcoming issue of the journal Psychological Science , mirrored those from the first study. Self-control at ages 7 and 11 predicted overall unemployment time by age 50 -- and higher joblessness at 23, 33, 42 and 50. Even when the subjects were in their 30s and 40s, a period when the overall unemployment rate for the group was low, self-control was a powerful predictor of job status. Advertisement It appears that poor self-control is a fairly stable aspect of personality, one that brings a host of disadvantages over the long haul. The early measures of self-discipline were varied, including not just attention and perseverance but carelessness, untidy work, restlessness, poor posture and rule breaking. It's not shocking that adults who never outgrow these traits -- who lack concentration, break rules and do sloppy work -- find fewer job opportunities. It gets worse. Daly and his colleagues figured that the link between self-control and joblessness would be most pronounced in hard times -- like during a major recession. To test this, they examined unemployment data for subjects who were tracked before and during the 1980s recession in the UK. They found a spike in joblessness among those with low self-control as the economy worsened. These workers' prospects appear particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic fluctuations, suggesting that in difficult times, when employers must cut back, it's those with self-control problems who get the ax. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

There's also no guarantee that pink-slipped workers with poor self-control will ever find their way back into the work force, even when the economy brightens. Career interruptions, the scientists say, can have lasting, even permanent, consequences. Skills become obsolete, and workers get derailed. Being out of work also breeds poor habits -- lack of sleep, poor nutrition and hygiene, drug and alcohol abuse -- especially for those who have self-control problems to begin with. Advertisement The scientists offer a glimmer of hope, even with these dreary results. Improving children's basic self-control skills could yield a lifetime of benefits in the world of work -- both to the individual worker and to society. The capacity for self-control is somewhat malleable and may be enhanced with training and practice in young children. Yoga, martial arts, computerized games, meditation -- all these interventions might offer kids a basic psychological tool that could last them a lifetime.

NASA Launches GOES-R Weather Satellite Images from the satellite are expected to enhance weather forecasts, provide advanced warning of floods and better tracking of wildfires, plumes and volcanic ash clouds. Irene Klotz Nov 19, 2016, 10:23 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla, Nov 19 - A U.S. weather satellite that will \u201crevolutionize\u201d forecasting blasted off from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral on Saturday, promising to deliver continuous high-definition views of hurricanes and other storms over the Western Hemisphere. A detailed stream of images provided by the satellite is expected to sharpen weather forecasts, provide more advanced warning of floods and better tracking of wildfires, plumes and volcanic ash clouds. Advertisement Carried atop an Atlas 5 rocket, the GOES-R satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 6:42 p.m. EST. #GOESR is currently in a coast phase while it heads toward geo orbit. In the meantime, check out this photo of the satellite leaving Earth! pic.twitter.com/VBeT2xKT6i \u2014 NOAA Satellites (@NOAASatellites) November 20, 2016 The launch was delayed an hour to resolve a technical issue with the rocket, developed by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. , said NASA launch commentator Mike Curie. A second, unrelated issue also contributed to the delay. Advertisement Once in position 22,300 miles (35,888 km) above the equator, GOES-R is designed to take a complete picture of the hemisphere every five minutes while simultaneously zooming in on specific regions to monitor fires, volcanic eruptions, heavy rainfall and storms. The satellite, the 17th in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, is the first to be launched since 2010. It is a step up from its predecessors, which take 30 minutes to image the hemisphere and are not capable of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. \u201cThis is a quantum leap,\u201d Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of Earth Sciences at NASA, said at a press conference on Thursday. \u201cIt will truly revolutionize weather forecasting.\u201d Advertisement The heart of the new satellite is a high-resolution camera, designed and built Exelis Inc., a subsidiary of Harris Corp . It can see in 16 wavelengths, compared with five available with the current system. GOES-R, developed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , has four times better resolution and can take images five times faster than its predecessors, said NOAA program scientist Steven Goodman. The satellite\u2019s capabilities go beyond weather forecasting. The sharper view will enable forecasters to see waves in clouds, for example, so pilots can avoid turbulence and give airline passengers smoother rides. Advertisement Go #GOESR !

It is the first of four satellites in a system upgrade that will cost $11 billion, including launch fees, said NOAA Assistant Administrator Stephen Volz. The next satellite is slated for launch in 2018. Advertisement GOES, along with a second, polar-orbiting weather satellite network operated by NOAA, has faced cost overruns and program delays due to technical issues and mismanagement, according to a December 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Once in orbit, the new satellite will undergo about 11 months of testing before it joins the operational fleet, which now numbers three units, NOAA said.

Scientists Discover New Homo Sapiens Mix With Mysterious Denisovans Neanderthals weren't the only ones modern humans liked to sleep with. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Mar 18, 2018, 04:11 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING It turns out that modern humans have a more complicated past than scientists realized. Researchers have discovered that populations of Homo sapiens swapped DNA in at least two regions of the world with a mysterious group of hominids known as Denisovans . The Denisovans appear to have made a contribution to the modern human gene pool \u2015 not nearly as significant as the Neanderthals , but notable. Advertisement Denisovans date back as far as 50,000 years ago, based on tests of a little Denisovan girl\u2019s finger bone and a bit of molar discovered in a Siberian cave in 2008. The new species was called Denisovan after the name of the cave in the Altai mountains. Scientists managed in 2016 to trace DNA of the Denisovans to some Melanesians \u2014 who live in Papua New Guinea and other Pacific islands \u2014 who were found to have 5 percent of Denisovan ancestry. Some East and South Asians have close to 0.2 percent. (Neanderthals have contributed between 1 percent and 4 percent of the genome in people in several continents.) But after a new DNA survey of humans, scientists from the University of Washington in Seattle were surprised to discover a new distinct set of Denisovan ancestry among some modern East Asians \u2014 particularly among Han Chinese, Chinese Dai and Japanese. This Denisovan DNA is more closely related to the sample from the fossils discovered in Siberia, according to the study published in the journal Cell . Advertisement The discovery demonstrates that there were at least two distinct populations of Denisovans living in Asia, and likely somewhat geographically distant. Harvard DNA researcher David Reich, who was not involved in the study, called the research a \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Technology Made Night Games Possible--And Changed Baseball History How Technology Made Nighttime Baseball Possible By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 4, 2015, 08:39 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Kansas City Monarchs pitching great Leroy Satchel Paige warms up at New York's Yankee Stadium August 2, 1942 for a Negro League game between the Monarchs and the New York Cuban Stars. Paige was considered a top prospect for the major leagues after baseball's commissioner ruled that there were no provisions barring players of color from the majors. (AP Photo/Matty Zimmerman) J. L. \u201cWilkie\u201d Wilkinson, a baseball team owner, needed to put more bodies in seats. It was 1930, the year after the stock market had crashed, and the Depression was taking its toll. Not even baseball was safe: One team had folded; a whole league disbanded. Wilkinson owned the Kansas City Monarchs, a winning team, but their daytime games made it impossible for working fans to attend. Additionally, the Monarchs were members of the Negro National League and didn\u2019t have their own stadium. Under the shadow of Jim Crow, where few stores and hotels would cater to them, playing baseball required lots of travel in unwelcoming conditions. And, while mostly black crowds attended the Monarchs\u2019 games, the efforts to attract new white fans were fruitless...

The SESAME Laboratory: Celebrating the Power of Light SESAME stands for Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East and will be a world-class particle-accelerator-based facility for applied research that covers the full spectrum from protein crystallography to understand the structure of viruses to solid-state physics to improve our computers. By Professor Rolf-Dieter Heuer, Contributor CERN Director General CERN Director General Jan 15, 2015, 06:00 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

This year is UNESCO's International Year of Light, and it's a very important one for a project that's close to my heart. UNESCO's theme this year is extremely broad, giving us the opportunity to celebrate subjects ranging from the development of LED lighting, honored last year by the award of the Nobel Prize in physics, to projects at CERN that will allow us to increase the brightness of the beams in our flagship Large Hadron Collider, LHC, and thereby enhance its capacity to bring us new insights into the inner workings of the universe we live in. But the project that I want to talk about here is SESAME, which stands for Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East. It is one of the most significant new scientific infrastructures being built in the world right now. As a synchrotron light source, SESAME will be a world-class particle-accelerator-based facility for applied research that covers the full spectrum from protein crystallography to understand the structure of viruses to solid-state physics to improve our computers. My story begins over 60 years ago, not in the Middle East but in Europe, when a group of visionary scientists and diplomats put forward the ideal of a European laboratory, not only as a center of scientific excellence but as a catalyst for peace in a continent emerging from the ashes of war. It was at the 1949 European Cultural Conference in Lausanne that this idea was first mooted. By 1951, the project had been adopted by UNESCO, which steered the fledgling laboratory into existence and oversaw the establishment of the CERN Convention in 1953. On Sept. 29, 1954, when a majority of CERN's 12 founder members had ratified the Convention, CERN emerged from under the wings of UNESCO as a fully fledged intergovernmental scientific organization in its own right, and the laboratory took its place in the international city of Geneva, already host to several intergovernmental organizations. Advertisement CERN's pioneers instilled the laboratory with two bold ambitions: to create a European center for scientific excellence, and to establish a place where the nations of Europe could work peacefully together after a period of conflict, a place where scientists from around the world could come together to advance the frontiers of knowledge. Last year, we celebrated our 60th anniversary. Both those ambitions have been amply fulfilled, and we remain true to those ideals. CERN is a world leader in its field of research, and people of over 100 nationalities rub shoulders here every day. CERN shows what can be achieved when people cast aside their differences to pursue a common goal. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Today the CERN story may be about to repeat itself. For many years now, a new breed of visionary scientists and diplomats have been working towards the establishment of a regional laboratory for the Middle East. It all began in 1995 at a historical meeting organized by CERN theoretical physicist Sergio Fubini and held under the shade of a Bedouin tent on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. It was there that representatives of Arab nations and Israel first took an official stand in support of Middle East scientific cooperation. Two decades later, their dream is taking physical shape in the form of SESAME, currently under construction near Amman in Jordan. Like CERN, SESAME was quickly adopted by UNESCO, and like CERN, SESAME became an intergovernmental organization in its own right once sufficient of its founder members had ratified its Convention. Today, SESAME's members are Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, and Turkey. Construction is well advanced, and research is due to commence in 2016. At SESAME, you are equally likely to run into an Iranian as an Israeli, a Cypriot, a Turk or a Palestinian, all pursuing the common dream of scientific excellence and peace among neighbors. SESAME is close to my heart not only because of the historical parallels with CERN and the hope it promises for scientific excellence and for peace but because CERN today has a very tangible stake in SESAME's success. With financial support from the European Commission, we are overseeing the construction of the SESAME main accelerator ring, the backbone of the facility. Later this year, all the components will be delivered to SESAME, in time to allow commissioning to begin in 2016 by scientists from across the region working to make the world a better place. What greater celebration of the power of light could one possibly hope for? 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

We Need Scientific Integrity In Cannabis Policy The research demonstrating the medicinal utility of cannabis is voluminous. By Dr. David Bearman, Contributor I am a California M.D. who specializes in pain management, harm reduction and medical cannabis I am a California M.D. who specializes in pain management, harm reduction and medical cannabis Nov 27, 2016, 05:42 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT In 2014, the New England Journal of Medicine ran a propaganda piece by Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) titled Adverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use . The article is occasionally referenced by neo-prohibitionists to demonstrate the position of the federal government that cannabis has no known medical use in the United States. This position is beyond absurd, it is dangerous to both public health and the role of science in the public square. Medical cannabis is legal in over half of the states in the union. Tincture of cannabis ( Sativex ) is legal to prescribe in 24 countries. The congressionally mandated mission of NIDA is to fund studies that are designed to demonstrate negative aspects of psychoactive drugs (including cannabis), but not the positive aspects of their effect on the human body. Advertisement The government seems to preferentially promote what is bad about certain drugs while they usually avoid discussing adverse effects of prescription drugs. Frankly, all one has to do is listen to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required listing of side effects on television drug ads to recognize that many FDA approved drugs have serious side effects. Cannabis does NOT have such serious side effects. As the DEA\u2019s Chief Administrative Law Judge acknowledged in 1988, cannabis is one of the safest therapeutic agents known to man. Cannabis is clearly safer than all the drugs advertised on TV. NIDA has been notorious for blocking research on cannabis by experts such as botanist Dr. Lyle Craker , oncologist Dr. Donald Abrams , and neurologist Dr. Ethan Russo . When research turns out contrary to the NIDA party line then NIDA makes every effort to bury it\u2014as they did with Dr. Donald Tashkin\u2019s research showing that not only does cannabis not cause lung cancer, but even smoked cannabis may decrease one\u2019s likelihood of getting lung cancer. This finding is consistent with dozens of basic science studies demonstrating that cannabinoids kill cancer cells. The research demonstrating the medicinal utility of cannabis is voluminous\u2014even in the face of strenuous efforts on the part of NIDA to block such research. The lack of intellectual honesty on the part of NIDA is legendary. We might be able to live with this lack of intellectual integrity if it weren\u2019t so deleterious to the nation\u2019s health and it didn\u2019t undermine good quality research. Advertisement In states where cannabis is legal, deaths due to opiates decreased 25% in 2000-2010 over states where it was illegal. Cannabinoid medicine specialists have noted a decrease of opiate use in chronic pain patients of 30-50%. This is because cannabis is an analgesic. Dr. Andrea Barthwell, a former top physician and George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cdrug czar\u201d poo-poo\u2019ed the idea of medicinal cannabis. She changed her tune after she became the official spokesperson for Sativex, a whole plant cannabis extract made by British company GW Pharmaceuticals. As long ago as a decade this doctor said that this whole plant cannabis extract was not really cannabis because it is standardized. It is, in fact, made from thousands of clones grown in a greenhouse under standardized conditions and so the tincture that is produced is consistent by using a standard. Of course, because of the legal status of cannabis in the United States, the government has blocked domestic testing and standardization. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Just recently the DEA denied rescheduling cannabis by rejecting the 21 studies done on Sativex by GW Pharmaceuticals who grows and makes it on the grounds that standardized cannabis was somehow not representative of cannabis in the U.S. Advertisement So what else is new in bureaucratic doublespeak? Not much. In the first quarter of the 20th century marijuana was illegal in over half the states in the union. At the exact same time there were more than 25 over-the-counter preparations on the market containing cannabis available in every pharmacy in the land, and American physicians were writing about three million cannabis-containing prescriptions per year. If we continue to this charade where the DEA and NIDA are obstructing legitimate scientific research, we will only harm the American people. It appears that NIDA is blocking important research that could help to further scientifically explore and possibly further affirm the potential therapeutic properties of cannabis for treating MS, Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, seizure disorder, autism spectrum disorder and cancer. It\u2019s time for the criminal justice system and the federal government to get out of the way of science. There is important work to do for the betterment of humankind.

The One Thing You Probably Didn't Know About Genetic Inheritance Contrary to common belief, a child can inherit more than just genes from their parents. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 27, 2015, 09:24 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Most of us learned in grade school that parents' DNA is passed on to their children, and that DNA is the only thing that gets passed on because memories and skills can't be inherited, right? Wrong. A new video (above) from the YouTube channel MinuteEarth explains not only why inheritance is far more complicated than you probably thought, but also why scientists are closely studying the field of epigenetics -- chemical modifications on your DNA that can pass to your children -- to better understand the weird nuances of inheritance.

The Crisis of Confidence in Medical Research It's been many years since I have trusted anything I read in a medical or psychiatric journal. There is an enterprise wide positive bias; findings never seem to replicate; benefits are hyped; harms are hidden. By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Jan 12, 2015, 02:46 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. It's been many years since I have trusted anything I read in a medical or psychiatric journal. There is an enterprise wide positive bias; findings never seem to replicate; benefits are hyped; harms are hidden. Drug companies bear most of the blame -- the research they sponsor is shoddy and market driven. Scientists are also to blame when they torture data so much it will confess to anything. Medical journals are to blame when they publish positive findings from lousy studies and reject negative results from well done studies. And journalists are to blame when they uncritically accept phony claims. It won't surprise you that the most widely cited study in the recent literature is also my favorite : 'Why Most Published Research Findings Are False' by John Ioannidis. David Healy, M.D. has been a leader in exposing the harms of drug treatments and the tricks of drug companies. He has also attacked the accepted wisdom that evidence based medicine requires the foundation of randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials (RCT). I agree with much of his criticism, but not with his conclusions. Here is a brief synopsis of our debate. Advertisement Dr. Healy writes: Most papers reporting results of drug sponsored randomized clinical trials are ghostwritten by people hired by the drug company. In a world where we usually have no access to the raw data, such papers published in premier medical journals can claim as safe and effective a drug that is in fact dangerous and ineffective. This is bad medical research that leads to bad medical practice. Proponents of Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) agree that drug company research behavior is egregiously bad, but argue this does not necessarily prove that clinical trials are inherently flawed. The problem supposedly lies in letting industry design, conduct, and implement the trials. Presumably everything would be okay if only the trials were designed and run by Angels or the Government -- studies would then deliver trustworthy, gold standard evidence that cannot possibly be obtained in any other way. EBM proponents favor the presumed objective results of controlled RCTs to the subjectivity of uncontrolled clinical observation. Without RCTs, they claim, we cannot practice Evidence Based Medicine. Should industry be stripped of the right to ghostwrite trials and be forced to allow access to the trial data they don't own? Sure, but even if run by Angels, trials favor industry because they allow weaker and weaker drugs to enter the market, while hiding the harms. Here's how. Clinical trials began as a way to demonstrate that experimenters knew what they were doing. If on the basis of good laboratory science demonstrating the pathology of a condition or direct observation of cures we had a drug that corrected a problem, then comparing it to placebo randomly allocated would show the drug to be superior to placebo. This test would not lead to new knowledge -- it would confirm what we think we already know. The only time we learn something from clinical trials is when a huckster who has duped vulnerable patients into taking a drug for some purpose is forced to compare his nostrum to placebo and the trial shows him to be a conman. A demonstration like this can make a major contribution to patient safety. In 1962, following the thalidomide crisis and just after the RCT method was developed, there was a political imperative to improve the safety of drugs. Based on the possibility that controlled study might control hucksterism, RCTs got built into the regulatory apparatus. It seemed a good idea to force the pharma camel to pass through the eye of a scientific needle in order to protect vulnerable patients. No-one recognized the pitfalls. First, in trials we compare a drug to placebo. Even snake oil would come out as having a benefit if we put a large enough number into the trial. Second, to run an RCT you have to hypnotize investigators and patients to ignore the 99 things a drug does, and focus instead only on one thing -- the thing both pharma or some Angels want you to focus on. There is a risk in generating ignorance in this way in order to nail down one effect while having a kind of hysterical blindness to harms. It's worth taking the risk when we show the drug doesn't work and the drug doesn't then get on the market -- which is what people expected in 1962, but is not what has happened since. Third, RCTs are supposed to deliver objectivity by controlling confounders, but when both the illness and the drug produce the same symptom, RCTs create ineradicable confounding. They make it possible for drug companies or Angels to pass off the harms caused by treatment as a symptom of the illness being treated. And in medicine, it's very common for both an illness and its treatment to produce overlapping effects. To then claim, as the rhetoric of Evidence Based Medicine does, that RCTs provide gold standard knowledge about what drugs do is to generate ignorance about ignorance. This is not just an abstract ignorance. In 1962, it took a year or two from the time of a drug's launch to recognize its major hazards. It now takes decades from the time of first description to the point where the field accepts a link between treatment and hazard. Drug induced death is likely now the leading cause of death -- it's difficult to be certain because we don't collect the data adequately. And little is being done to remedy our lack of awareness of drug risks. More of the same RCTs are not the remedy. The calculations that come out of an RCT are only as good as the data (observations) that go in. In the belief that RCTs are more objective than doctors and patients, we have undermined the abilities of people to observe and act on the basis of their observations. It is when people with a range of biases agree on what they are seeing that we get objectivity -- a mechanical process can never deliver this. RCTs created Evidence Based Medicine. Most listeners hearing EBM hear Data Based Medicine, but evidence is not data. Statistical calculations derived from aggregates are a way to deal with conmen -- not a guide to the practice of medicine. The individual patient is the datum in medicine. Thanks, Dr. Healy. I agree with you on the diagnosis of what ails the clinical research literature, but disagree with your suggested cure. If we have learned one thing from the history of medicine, it is the dangerous fallibility of uncontrolled and anecdotal clinical observation. Doctors have killed patients for millennia by bleeding them, administering emetics and cathartics, and prescribing poisons. The power of the placebo effect, the vagaries of chance correlational associations, and observer bias all overwhelm the generalizability of any given clinical observation. Advertisement Dr. Healy is right about the fallibility of clinical trials, especially when their basic purpose is not to help patients, but rather to sell drugs or advance research careers. But his solution is even more fallible. We have done the experiment for thousands of years and the clear conclusion is that anecdotal medicine is arbitrary and harmful medicine. The only responsible courses of action are to improve designs and measures, standardize implementation, change sponsors, achieve complete transparency, report harms as thoroughly as benefits, and eliminate hype. With all the limitations, there is simply no substitute for randomized placebo controlled studies -- we must improve them because we can't do without them. Advertisement But it is clearly allowing the fox to guard the henhouse to give drug companies the franchise in conducting the studies that lead to the regulatory approval of their products. The huge financial rewards will inevitably lead to badly biased implementation that cannot be adequately corrected even if there is complete after the fact transparency. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Drug companies should be taxed to support an independent testing agency that would be responsible for conducting consumer oriented clinical trials for safety and efficacy prior to regulatory approval and for collecting later surveillance data on adverse effects. No system will ever be perfect, but independent trials would be a great advance over the junk we have now and far more trustworthy than the uncontrolled clinical observation suggested by Dr. Healy. Advertisement Dr. Healy replies: It's a mistake to generalize from the effects of a drug on the patient in front of me to the average effects of a drug, but it is an even more dangerous clinical mistake to generalize from average effects in studies to the patient in front of me. The drugs that came on the market in the 1950s before we began using RCTs were more effective and safer -- guided by doctors reporting on what they saw in front of them -- than the drugs we have had since. My last word: The pioneer drugs of the '50s were all such home runs they could be discovered by clinical serendipity and n-of-1 observation. But the low hanging fruit has all long since been picked. Refinements with much lower effect sizes require systematic study. Dr. Healy's last word: \"Do we want treatments with low effect sizes especially if their hazards are hidden by the trial process?\" My last-last word: We can't expect every useful drug to be a home run.

Many Commonly Used Drugs Are Useless Many Commonly Used Drugs Are Useless By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Aug 7, 2016, 07:01 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

I am so thankful for the trusty med that tames my atrial fibrillation. Many meds are helpful -- demonstrating superiority to placebo in ways that are clearly clinically significant and life enhancing. But many (perhaps most) drugs are probably no more than very expensive placebos. Patients get prescriptions from doctors when their symptoms are most severe and improve with time and positive expectation, not because the med is really effective. Advertisement Doctors and patients need independent, objective information on drug efficacy and risks. The multibillion dollar pharma marketing machine can turn even the most useless and harmful drugs into financial blockbusters. Doctors and patients need independent, objective information on drug efficacy and risks. This is the first of a series of blogs aimed at setting the record straight. Dick Bijl is President of the International Society Of Drug Bulletins (ISDB), a wonderful organization representing 53 national drug bulletins, each charged with presenting the best available data on the pluses and minuses of different medications. Drug bulletins are a source of truth to help patients and doctors see through the fudged misinformation generated by ubiquitous Pharma propaganda. Dick writes: \"Let's use the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) as a typical example of why and how medication use has become so excessive.\" Advertisement Elderly men often experience problems urinating -- weak or intermittent urinary stream, straining, hesitancy, terminal dribbling, incomplete emptying, urgency, frequency, incontinence, nocturia and/or post-micturition dribbling. These symptoms, so common in aging, provide a lucrative target market for pharma. In the past, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was regarded as the most important cause of urinary symptoms. Nowadays, evidence confirming a link between LUTS and prostatic enlargement is regarded as weak. This hasn't prevented approval of many drugs for the treatment of BPH by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The bar for approval is set very low. Drug companies have only to show that their medication has a statistically significant advantage when compared to placebo. The FDA and EMA don't require that the med achieve what is ever so much more important- clinically relevant improvement as evidenced by patients actually also feeling and doing better when taking the drug. Small statistical blips are all it takes to get a drug approved. Advertisement There is a huge difference between statistical significance and clinical relevance. For example, the International Prostatic Symptoms Score is often used to quantify the treatment effects of urinary drugs. The IPSS scale goes from 0-35 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. A difference of \u22653 points = some effect; \u22655 points = moderate effect; \u22658 pt. = clear effect). In practice, it turns out that patients can't detect improvements if they are less than three points. The results of clinical trials have shown that most drugs used to treat BPH are statistically more efficacious than placebo, but have no real clinical relevance. Because their improvement was less than three points, patients will not detect any difference between these drugs and placebo. The same lack of clinical relevance holds for drug combinations. A combination of an alpha blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor or an alpha blocker and an antimuscarinic drug often results in statistically significant decreases in symptoms compared to placebo or to the individual drugs given alone. But here also, the differences were of such small magnitude that patients will not detect them. Advertisement Only in a small minority of clinical trials was the decrease in symptom score more than 3 points. The lack of efficacy of BPS meds supports a policy of watchful waiting instead of starting drug therapy. The natural course of LUTS is quite favorable and in the majority of patients the severity of the symptoms will not increase. Most (or all) of the relief patients feel taking the med is probably due to natural improvement or placebo effect, not to the med itself -- but they don't know this and will often misattribute benefit to the drug. And almost all the drug studies have been performed in secondary and tertiary care. The results of these studies can't simply be generalized to primary care because it is not plausible that these patients have the same characteristics and therefore the same prognosis. Advertisement It's not rational to prescribe drugs that do not improve functioning more than placebo. Use of medication for LUTS should be discouraged since it is no better than placebo, but adds the risk of side effects. Counseling and re-assurance should be considered first. Informed patients will be much less willing to take a drug that carries the risk of side effects, while offering at best only a very slight improvement in symptoms. Whenever it is decided to start drug therapy, the best choice are alpha blockers. Side effects should be taken into account: fatigue, decreased vision, severe postoperative ophthalmological side effects or complications, orthostatic hypotension leading to headache and dizziness. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors should not be regarded as an alternative because of their small efficacy and side effects like gynecomastia, erection and ejaculation disorders, decreased libido, impotence, and breast cancer. Advertisement The antimuscarinics do not have a positive balance of efficacy and they have anticholinergic side effects (e.g., dry mouth, abdominal pain and constipation). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been introduced in recent years but studied insufficiently in comparative studied to give them a place. Combination-therapy should not be given because it does not have an added value related to clinical relevance but does add side effects. We conclude that the natural course of LUTS in men is generally favorable; the pathophysiology of LUTS is not clear; the relation between prostatic volume and urinary complaints is weak; the mechanisms of action of meds is uncertain; and positive effects are small in placebo-controlled studies. Therefore, primarily counseling and non-drug treatment are indicated and drug-treatment should be discouraged. In case a drug is needed only an alpha blocker is indicated, but this often just a very expensive placebo-therapy.\" Advertisement Thanks Dick for this illuminating analysis. Before considering any med useful, we should subtract placebo effect from reported efficacy- and also consider the considerable risk of med side effects and Pharma's ridiculously high prices. In a rational world, people would be taking many fewer drugs, for much clearer indications, with benefits always balanced by consideration of risks, and with prices reflecting real value. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Psychologists Push For Smartphone Warning Labels Technology addiction may be the next big public health issue. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Oct 8, 2015, 12:49 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Dean Belcher via Getty Images We're used to seeing warning labels on alcohol, cigarettes and prescription drugs, for obvious reasons. But if one group of scientists has anything to say about it, similar warning labels will soon be showing up on your smartphone or tablet. Advertisement Psychologists and computer scientists from Bournemouth University in the UK argue that the disclaimers should be added to personal digital devices so that people will be aware of the risks of excessive use. \"Excessive and obsessive usage and preoccupation about technology are associated with undesirable behaviors such as reduced creativity, depression and disconnection from reality,\" Dr. Raian Ali, a professor of computing at the university and the study's lead author, said in a statement. He's right. A growing body of research suggests that the Internet , smartphones and social media are all potentially addictive. And with the increasing digital saturation of our daily lives, it's easy to lose awareness of the amount of time we're spending in front of screens and how it's affecting us. Advertisement For this reason, the researchers say, warning labels on personal devices should be considered a \"social responsibility\" for technology developers. In a study published in March , Ali and his colleagues surveyed 72 adult technology users, and found that 80 percent were receptive to the idea of warning labels on digital devices. Roughly 30 percent said they thought warning labels were a good idea and that labels might encourage people to use their digital devices more mindfully. The researchers flagged 11 male and female respondents (all between the ages of 19 and 35) whose survey results suggested that they were addicted to their devices and who indicated interest in the warning labels. They also flagged four people who did not think warning labels would be effective. Through 30-minute interviews with each participant, the researchers identified ways to maximize the effectiveness of the warning labels for consumers. Advertisement What would a phone warning label look like? Most importantly, it would note the possible risks of addictive technology use, including withdrawal symptoms , tolerance to increased usage, relapse when trying to adjust usage and mood modification when online. (Wondering how addicted you are to your smartphone? Take this research-based \"nomophobia\" test to find out.) Unlike warning on cigarette packages or vodka bottles, digital warning labels could be interactive, with features like timers and reminders to help people limit their screen time. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It's hard to say right now. \"Labels raise awareness and enable people to make a sort of self-monitoring so that they can adjust their usage style or at least take an informed decision about it,\" he said. \"It is like having a scale at home to measure your weight and regulate your eating style. ...

New magnetic data suggests Tamu Massif isn't just an ordinary volcano, but is a kind of volcanic hybrid built by two separate processes. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s in between a mid-ocean ridge and a simple conical volcano,\u201d William Sager , a marine geophysicist at the University of Houston, told Scientific American. Advertisement Kanijoman/Flickr Located approximately 1,000 miles east of Japan and 6,500 feet below the ocean's surface, Tamu Massif is about the size of New Mexico and nearly as big as the largest volcanoes on Mars . It covers an area of about 120,000 square miles -- 60 times that of Hawaii's Mauna Loa , the largest active volcano on Earth. \u201c This volcano is a beast ,\u201d J\u00f6rg Geldmacher, a marine geophysicist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany, told Scientific American. Advertisement While not particularly tall -- about 2.5 miles from base to summit -- Tamu Massif is enormously wide, with very gradual slopes. \"If you were standing on this thing, you would have a difficult time telling which way was downhill,\" Sager told Scientific American. In an effort to better understand how the mysterious volcano formed, Sager and his team set out on a 36-day expedition in early October to collect magnetic data, mapping nearly 400,000 square miles of the ocean floor.

JOHN GREEN/SCHMIDT OCEAN INSTITUTE As National Geographic reports, magnetic field research suggests the mountain formed relatively quickly around 145 million years ago, when lava began flowing onto the sea floor from mid-ocean ridges. The central part of the peak, however, is like a big magnetic blob , suggesting a large eruption may have been involved in its formation. Ultimately, Sager said, studying Tamu Massif will help geologists better understand how the Earth's interior works . Advertisement \"The secrets revealed will be ongoing but worth the wait as we begin to understand how such a massive volcano can form the way it did and what it means to us in respect to the formation of the planet we call home,\" Suraida Nanez James at the Schmidt Ocean Institute wrote in an expedition update on Nov. 2. While Tamu Massif has earned the title of most massive volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is considered both the tallest volcano and the tallest mountain . With a base about 19,685 feet below sea level and a summit about 13,796 feet above sea level, Mauna Kea is over 33,000 feet tall -- in other words, about six and a quarter miles. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Asteroid's Upcoming 'Brush' Past Earth Is Nothing To Worry About NASA says there\u2019s no danger the space rock will slam into our planet. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 8, 2016, 10:50 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Don't panic. Earth isn't going to be hit by a basketball court-sized asteroid early next month. The 100-foot wide space rock named \"2013 TX68\" could soar just 11,000 miles away from us on March 5. But NASA says there's absolutely no chance the \"brush\" or \"buzz,\" as it's been described, will see it slam into our planet. There's a tiny possibility (we're talking 1-in-250-million) it may happen on a future flyby in September 2017, says NASA's Center for NEO Studies. Advertisement \"2013 TX68,\" not pictured, is believed to be around 100-foot wide. Elenarts via Getty Images It's also possible when it circles back again in 2046 and 2097. CNEOS manager Paul Chodas, however, says the chances are \"far too small to be of any real concern.\" But this 2016 flyby? It will most definitely not be happening, CNEOS says. In fact, scientists aren't really sure exactly how close it will come next month. Advertisement They've only been tracking the asteroid since its discovery by the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey in 2013. But as they only monitored it for three days before it passed from the Earth's nighttime to daytime sky and couldn't be seen anymore, its precise orbit couldn't be calculated. Therefore, s cientists say it could end up anywhere between 11,000 to 9 million miles away from Earth next month, as this graphic illustrates: This graphic indicates the cloud of possible locations asteroid \"2013 TX68\" will be in at the time of its closest approach to Earth during its safe flyby of our planet on March 5. NASA/JPL-Caltech Advertisement \"2013 TX68\" last flew past Earth in 2014 at some 1.3 million miles away. Due to its uncertain trajectory, Chodas says it will be tough to predict exactly where to look for it in the sky. Whether stargazers will get a glimpse depends on its distance and position. \"There is a chance that the asteroid will be picked up by our asteroid search telescopes when it safely flies past us next month, providing us with data to more precisely define its orbit around the sun,\" he said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Is What It Looks Like When A Star Explodes KABOOM! By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Mar 22, 2016, 02:30 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Get those sunglasses ready. For the first time ever, scientists at NASA have seen the glorious flash of an exploding star's shockwave. Using the Kepler Space Telescope, researchers searched 500 distant galaxies over three years, \"hunting for signs of massive stellar death explosions known as supernovae ,\" NASA said. Advertisement Researchers found two exploding stars, called KSN 2011a and KSN 2011d. The first is roughly 300 times the size of our sun and 700 million light years from Earth. The second is approximately 500 times the size of our sun and about 1.2 billion light years away. \u201cTo put their size into perspective, Earth's orbit about our sun would fit comfortably within these colossal stars,\u201d Peter Garnavich , who leads the research team, said in a NASA press release. When a massive star runs out of fuel for nuclear reactions, gravity collapses its core. This sends out a shockwave of energy, resulting in the bright flash that scientists call the \"shock breakout.\" The phenomenon lasts only about 20 minutes. Advertisement In this case, just the larger star -- KSN 2011d -- delivered a shock breakout. NASA posted an animation to YouTube that shows the increasing brightness of KSN 2011d's explosion. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Super-Earths' May Have Stable Oceans That Are Key For Alien Life New Clue In Search For Alien Life Seen In 'Super-Earth' Simulation By James Cave Men's Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 12, 2015, 01:16 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT NASA's Kepler space telescope celebrated its 1,000th exoplanet discovery earlier this month, an impressive milestone in the search for life on other worlds. Now astronomers are homing in on those exoplanets that may have liquid water , which is thought to be essential for supporting life. And according to new research, so-called \"super-Earths\" may host vast oceans that last for billions of years. Advertisement A super-Earth is an extrasolar planet whose mass is greater than Earth's but smaller than that of gas giants like Neptune and Uranus. Earth's mantle holds vast amounts of water, which returns to to the surface through volcanism. Since this \"recycling\" process is crucial for maintaining our planet's oceans, researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center For Astronomy (CfA) wondered if a similar process might occur on super-Earths. The researchers used computer simulations on various super-Earths to find out how long it would take oceans to form on them, and whether the oceans could be sustained. Advertisement What did they find? Super-Earths between two and four times Earth's mass seem to be even better than Earth at establishing and maintaining oceans. In fact, the water on these planets could last for at least 10 billion years, the research suggested. The finding may give astronomers one more thing to consider when figuring out which exoplanets are likeliest to harbor extraterrestrial life, according to Laura Schaefer, a CfA graduate student and the leader of the research effort. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have long suspected that being overweight affects the brain. Now, a neuroimaging study from the University of Cambridge provides dramatic new evidence of how great the effects can be (Ronan et al., 2016). The study, published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, compared a group of people with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI) of 19.5 to an overweight and obese group with a BMI averaging 43.4. It found that \u201ccerebral white matter volume in overweight and obese individuals was associated with a greater degree of atrophy, with maximal effects in middle-age.\u201d The biggest changes were seen in the brain\u2019s white matter, the tissue responsible for communicating information between regions of the brain. White matter makes up around half the volume of the brain, and it connects various regions of gray matter to coordinate their functions. It joins all four of the brain\u2019s lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) with each other, and with the emotional brain or limbic system in the center. Advertisement The researchers looked at the brains of 527 people aged 20 to 87. They found few differences in the brains of younger people. By age 50, however, the effects of obesity in the brain were dramatic, with the brain of an obese 50 year old, for instance, looking like the brain of a lean 60 year old. Comparison of grey matter (brown) and white matter (yellow) in gender-matched subjects. Lisa Ronan Other studies have shown that obesity is associated with other diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. An examination of the lifespan differences found that obesity cuts 8 years off your lifespan. But when the effects of obesity-related diseases are factored in, the difference rises to 30 years (Grover et al., 2015). Advertisement One of the brain study\u2019s investigators, Professor Sadaf Farooqi of the Institute of Metabolic Science at Cambridge, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know the implications of these changes in brain structure. Clearly, this must be a starting point for us to explore in more depth the effects of weight, diet and exercise on the brain and memory.\u201d This raises the intriguing question of whether weight loss can reverse the brain atrophy found in overweight people. One of the study\u2019s authors, professor Paul Fletcher of the Department of Psychiatry wonders \u201cwhether these changes could be reversible with weight loss, which may well be the case.\u201d While long term weight loss is elusive, with research showing that most dieters regain even more weight than they lost, there are several new studies demonstrating that it is possible. When emotional eating is successfully treated, not only do dieters maintain their new weight, they continue losing weight over time. Advertisement A study at Bond University found that using EFT or Emotional Freedom Techniques, a common treatment for psychological trauma , dieters lost an additional 11.1 lb over the course of the subsequent year (Stapleton, Sheldon et al., 2012; Stapleton, Bannatyne et al., 2016). Lead researcher, psychology professor Dr. Peta Stapleton, is now using neuroimaging to study the brains of these successful losers. This will provide clues as to whether the atrophy noted in the Cambridge study is reversible. References Ronan, L., Alexander-Bloch, A. F., Wagstyl, K., Farooqi, S., Brayne, C., Tyler, L.

Andromeda: Our Sister Galaxy By measuring very precisely the motion of the Andromeda galaxy relative to the Milky Way, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were able to determine in 2012 that the Milky Way and Andromeda are destined for a head-on collision in about 4 billion years.

In Greek mythology, Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, was stripped and chained to a rock, only to be saved from certain death in the claws of a sea monster by Perseus (Figure 1 shows a wonderful depiction of the myth by Lord Frederic Leighton). Figure 1. 'Perseus and Andromeda' by Lord Frederic Leighton. Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. At Google Cultural Institute . In the northern sky, a constellation is named Andromeda, and it contains the galaxy M31 (so cataloged by astronomer Charles Messier on August 3rd, 1764), commonly known as the Andromeda galaxy. At a distance of 2.5 million light years, the Andromeda galaxy is next door in astronomical terms. Its mass is only about twice that of the Milky Way, making the two galaxies if not quite twins, then close sisters. Advertisement By measuring very precisely the motion of Andromeda relative to the Milky Way, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were able to determine in 2012 that the Milky Way and Andromeda are destined for a head-on collision in about 4 billion years. About two billion years later, the two sister spiral galaxies will completely merge, most probably producing an elliptical galaxy. While solar system will not be destroyed during the collision, it is very likely that it will be flung into a new region of the merged galaxy. Figure 2 is a photo illustration of what the night sky may look like as the two galaxies will be on their way to that fateful encounter. This view was inspired by detailed computer modeling of the future collision. Figure 2. Illustration of the expected collision between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. Recently, astronomers combined data from two large surveys to discover that, like its mythological namesake, Andromeda has experienced a rather violent history. One of the surveys (SPLASH) used the Keck telescope to measure the radial (in our direction) velocities of more than 10,000 stars. The other survey (the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury; PHAT) used the sharp vision of the Hubble Space Telescope to produce an unprecedented, high-definition image of a part of Andromeda (see Figure 3 and the Zoom into M31 video on the web page of STScI News Release Number: STScI-2015-02). Advertisement Figure 3. A high-definition panoramic view of a part of the Andromeda galaxy . A product of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) program. (Credit: NASA, ESA, J. Dalcanton, B.F. Williams, and L.C. Johnson [University of Washington], the PHAT team, and R. Gendler.) The two sets of observations revealed an intriguing distinction between young and old stars in Andromeda. While we normally associate youth with rebellion, and old age with discipline, the youngest stars were found to rotate in an orderly fashion around Andromeda's center, while the older stars displayed a less ordered, more chaotic motion. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Possible explanations for these observations include a series of past bombardments of Andromeda by a number of smaller satellite galaxies, and an evolution of Andromeda's disk from a more puffed-up configuration to a thinner one. Either way, it appears that our sister galaxy may have had a rougher past than the Milky Way. This fascinating object is just about the most distant thing we can see in the night's sky with the naked eye.

After A Year In Space, NASA Astronaut's Gene Expression Has Changed. Possibly Forever. Only 93 percent of Scott Kelly's gene expression has \"returned to normal\" since his prolonged stint on the International Space Station, according to a new study. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 15, 2018, 08:51 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING After spending a year in space, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly is not the man he used to be \u2014 at least genetically speaking. His genetic expression has changed, according to preliminary results from a NASA study that compared the bodily changes between the astronaut and his identical twin, who stayed on Earth while Kelly was aboard the International Space Station. Advertisement About 7 percent of Kelly\u2019s gene activity has yet to \u201creturn to normal\u201d \u2015 almost two years after his yearlong expedition came to an end. Kelly has since retired from NASA. The Twins Study , as it\u2019s been dubbed, looked at what happened to Kelly \u2014 both from a physiological and psychological perspective \u2014 before, during and after his trip in space, and then compared that data to Kelly\u2019s twin brother, Mark. Mark Kelly is also a retired NASA astronaut . Unlike his brother, however, who spent months at a time in space, Mark\u2019s missions were on the shorter side. His last \u2015 and longest \u2015 mission, which took place in 2011, lasted 15 days.

Advertisement Although most of the biological changes Kelly experienced in space disappeared in the hours and days (and in some cases, weeks) after his return to Earth, NASA said some alterations appear to have persisted. While 93 percent of his genetic expression has returned to normal, several hundred \u201cspace genes\u201d still have changed activity levels, the data suggests. NASA said this could indicate \u201clonger term changes\u201d in genetic expression, caused by the stresses of spaceflight. NASA said it would be releasing more findings from the Twins Study in the coming months. This research, they added, will inform their planning for a mission to Mars , which would see astronauts spending some three years in space. Advertisement Reacting to the news of the study results this week, Kelly expressed amazement at his body\u2019s changes \u2015 and also used the opportunity to poke fun at his brother. \u201cThis could be good news,\u201d he joked on Twitter. \u201cI no longer have to call [Mark] my identical twin brother anymore.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Incredible Brain Of Simone Biles Neuroscientists are beginning to understand how the nervous system allows us to move -- and their findings may someday reveal how elite gymnasts perform extraordinary movement sequences. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Aug 7, 2016, 08:12 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Gymnast Simone Biles is expected to bring back a gold medal (or more) from the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Team USA gymnast Simone Biles twists and flips through air with a seemingly gravity-defying buoyancy . With great precision, she lands on the balance beam as if the 4-inch-wide ledge is an extension of her own body. As the 19-year-old gymnast competes in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro this week, pulling out the types of combinations that have been repeatedly called \u201cimpossible,\u201d you may ask what it is exactly that sets her apart \u2014 is it only practice? Or does Biles have a particular brain wiring that\u2019s given her a repertoire of movements far beyond a human\u2019s humble ability to walk straight and a traditional gymnast\u2019s perfect 10 ? Advertisement Scientists haven\u2019t looked into Bile\u2019s brain, but if they were given the chance, they wouldn\u2019t even necessarily know which area to peek at first. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question,\u201d said Thomas Jessell, co-director of Columbia University\u2019s Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and a neuroscientist who has studied movement for over three decades. Understanding how someone like Biles acquires her athletic skills is \u201can issue where no one bit of the brain or the spinal cord is going to give you the definitive answer.\u201d The closest idea we have as to what makes someone a super-athlete like Michael Jordan or Biles is that they may have been born with a slightly better-wired motor system. Advertisement \u201cIt could be that the wiring that happened in early development was particularly precise,\u201d Jessell said. \u201cSo you have the opportunity to refine and perform motor tasks more effectively.\u201d Columbia | Zuckerman Institute The motor system in the brain is mysterious and complex. Nevertheless, over the past few decades, neuroscience has made advances in deciphering how a 3-pound organ controls hundreds of muscles in the body. Advertisement Even a simple movement \u2015 say, taking one single step \u2015 requires the orchestrated work of many parts of the brain. Simply put, when you decide to move a limb, neurons in the primary motor cortex of the brain devise a plan. This plan involves commands to multiple muscles that need to flex or extend to carry out the desired movement. The command signals pass through other brain areas, which refine the plan by amping the necessary signals and shutting down the noise. The signals are then sent down through the spinal cord to reach the muscles. Jessell\u2019s own research has revealed how young cells grow into the type of neurons that contribute to movement in the spinal cord. There are probably at least a million cells just in the primary motor cortex that are communicating with the spinal cord. The activity of those cells is controlled by many tens of millions of nerve cells elsewhere in the brain. \u201cWe get to very big numbers very quickly,\u201d Jessell said. Add to this complex picture the numerous other brain mechanisms that sense where the body is in space at any given time and work to keep it from falling down. (For an overview, check out the infographic above.) Advertisement Luckily, we don\u2019t need to understand this complex system in order to put one foot in front of the other. What\u2019s more, this intricate system learns pretty well (for example, think about how babies start by chaotically throwing their arms around but eventually learn to hold their head up and stand straight). With rigorous training, most people can push the normal set of everyday movements further and learn to do the flips that Biles does. \u201cBut they\u2019d do it a hell of a lot less well,\u201d Jessell said. Some researchers have attempted to see how the brain\u2019s structure and function may change as a result of gymnastics training. In a series of experiments, researchers at South China Normal University scanned the brains of world class gymnasts and found that the nerve connections between the cortex and the spinal cord were stronger in gymnasts compared with non-gymnasts. They also found increased connectivity in the brain regions responsible for sensory and motor functions, as well as attentional systems. Moreover, the brains of the champions appeared to have greater efficiency in several brain regions that correspond to motor and attention functions. Advertisement \u201cOur study indicates that neuroanatomical adaptations ... occur in gymnasts\u2019 brain anatomical networks either in response to long-term intensive gymnastic training or as an innate predisposition or both,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study published in NeuroImage in 2013. These neuroanataomical adaptations are what scientists call brain plasticity\u2014that is, the brain\u2019s ability to learn by rearranging its own wiring and fortifying some connections throughout practice. While all brains are good at learning, it\u2019s possible that some brains are more plastic than others. In other words, what sets super-athletes apart may be their brain\u2019s enhanced learning ability. If that\u2019s the case for the brain of someone like Biles, it means her motor system responds to physical practice even better than what\u2019s normally expected. Advertisement To really understand what\u2019s happening inside the brain of an extraordinary gymnast like Biles, we may need new technology to see the brain in action, Jessell said. \u201cThere have been remarkable advances in the last two decades in the technology for monitoring nerve cells while they\u2019re functioning. But we need to go much further.\u201d For more Olympics coverage: 21 Times This Year\u2019s U.S. Olympic Women\u2019s Gymnasts Were Straight-Up Superheroes How To Sound Like You Know Your Stuff While Watching Olympic Gymnastics 10 Olympians Who Will Make History Before They Even Compete In Rio Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Tiny Dinosaur Discovered In China Had Wings Like A Bat--Or Did It? Bizarre Dino With Bat-Like Wings Discovered Overseas By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 30, 2015, 08:49 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A newly discovered bat-like dinosaur has given paleontologists a fascinating new puzzle to solve. Fossils of the tiny dino, unearthed recently in China's Hebei Province, date back about 160 million years. And a new study of Yi qi, as the creature is known, suggests that the pigeon-sized prehistoric creature had featherless wings . It's the only such dinosaur ever discovered. \"This is the most unexpected discovery I have ever made, even though I have found a few really bizarre dinosaurs in my career ,\" Dr. Xing Xu, a paleontologist at Linyi University in China and a co-author of the study, told Live Science. Advertisement For the study, the researchers examined the fossils, piecing together the dinosaur's unique forelimbs. They discovered patches of membranous tissue preserved between the rod-like bones that extend from each wrist, which is evidence for the wings , the Associated Press reported. (Story continues below image.) An illustration of the dinosaur, Yi qi, which is Mandarin for \"strange wing.\" But just because Yi qi may have had wings like a bat doesn't necessarily mean it flew like a bat. Some scientists think it did, but others argue that the dinosaur might have been more of a glider than a flapper . Some scientists aren't sure Yi qi flew at all, arguing that the membranous structures weren't wings but possibly embellishments displayed during courtship rituals. Advertisement \"The temptation to associate these membranes with flight may be misleading,\" Dr. Thomas Holtz, Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park, who was not involved in the study, told Nature. \u201cThis is one of the strangest animals that I\u2019ve seen in the fossil record in years ... It\u2019s raising a lot more puzzles than it\u2019s solving.\" The study was published online in the journal Nature on April 29, 2015. How much do you know about dinosaurs? Check out the \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" video below for five other scientific findings that just may change the way you think about the prehistoric beasts. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Donald Trump's Border Wall Could Have 'Yuge' Environmental Costs Mexicans wouldn't be the only ones paying a high price for the wall. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Aug 17, 2016, 04:56 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Donald Trump \u2019s plan to build a towering, migrant-proof wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has been slammed as stupid and moronic , not to mention racist and xenophobic . Among mainstream pundits anyway, it\u2019s not what you\u2019d call wildly popular. And the wall \u2015 which Trump said might soar up to 65 feet high and which would cost untold billions to build \u2015 seems to be just as unpopular among wildlife scientists. They argue that the wall could trigger major environmental problems , damaging delicate ecosystems and restricting the free movement of animals in border areas, including jaguars, pygmy owls, bighorn sheep and other species, some of which are endangered. \u201cProtecting free movement of wildlife over national borders has been a tenet of North American conservation for more than a hundred years,\u201d Dr. Clinton Epps, an associate professor in the department of fisheries and wildlife at Oregon State University, told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cThe only reason we have any of such species in parts of the region (or in the case of the jaguar, at all in the U.S.) is the potential for such movements.\u201d Advertisement The ability to roam freely is critically important because it helps animals find food and water as well as mates. And by restricting access to these vital resources, a wall could reduce the number of animals along the border \u2015 including big predators at the top of the food chain \u2015 and make them less genetically diverse and more vulnerable to disease and drought. It gets worse from there. \u201cOnce there is disruption to the complex ecosystem in this way, there is a risk of triggering a cascade of secondary effects,\u201d Dr. Jamie McCallum, co-author of a 2014 study of fencing that is already in place along certain parts of the border, told HuffPost in an email. \u201cSimply put, less apex predators leads to more deer, which leads to greater vegetation predation, which leads to less pollination with a further effect on bird species and insects.\u201d Just how bad could things get? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that an unbroken barrier running along the entire land border between the U.S. and Mexico would affect 111 endangered species and 108 migratory bird species , Outside magazine reported. Advertisement And that includes the bald eagle. Bald eagle. Gabriel Grams via Getty Images Unlike pygmy owls, which fly low to the ground, eagles can easily fly over even a tall wall. But they\u2019d suffer anyway because construction of the wall would disrupt a large portion of their habitat, according to Outside. If the enormous financial and environmental costs of the wall and the political fallout it would cause aren\u2019t enough to persuade Trump to drop his plan, maybe the fact that it could harm our national symbol isn\u2019t enough either. Advertisement But McCallum offered a tidbit that just might: \u201cMy own research showed that there was no significant difference in the number of migrants present in areas where there was a wall, compared to areas where there was no wall,\u201d McCallum said. \u201cIn other words, the wall did not seem to be doing the job it was intended for.\u201d Are you listening, Mr. Trump?

Tiny Cheetah Cubs Fighting For Survival After Rare C-Section Birth The cubs were born at a Cincinnati zoo earlier this month. MARCUS E. HOWARD Mar 21, 2016, 07:34 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) \u2015 Five cheetah cubs are fighting for their lives after being delivered prematurely at a Cincinnati zoo by a cesarean section, a procedure seldom performed during the birth of the endangered cats. The cubs , born earlier this month, have weak immune systems and are unable to actively ward off infections, said Mark Campbell, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden\u2019s director of animal health. Advertisement The three males and two females are receiving around-the-clock critical care, which involves bottle feeding every three hours, Campbell said in a statement on Friday. \u201cMom is recovering, and we\u2019re working hard to put some weight on the premature cubs ,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cImportant benchmarks for survival of these cubs are the first week and month of life.\u201d Belonging to a species considered the world\u2019s fastest land animal, the cubs are expected to receive special care for the next eight to 12 weeks. Zoo visitors are allowed to peek at them through nursery windows. Advertisement The cubs were born on March 8 at the zoo\u2019s regional cheetah breeding facility. It was only the third cesarean section Campbell said he was involved in during his 25-year career at the zoo, one of the oldest in the United States. The Cincinnati Zoo is a leading captive breeder of cheetah s, a big cat that is native to the savannahs of Africa. Since 2002, about 54 cheetah cubs have been born at the zoo, officials said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Cheetah s are considered endangered, as their worldwide population has shrunk because of excessive hunting, reduced prey and loss of natural habitat. Fewer than 10,000 remain in 23 African countries, according to the Namibian-based Cheetah Conservation Fund.
