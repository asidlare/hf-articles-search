Skiers Stumble Across Endangered Snow Leopard Isn't skiing scary enough? By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 15, 2016, 10:59 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Skiers chanced upon a rare snow leopard as they zipped down a mountainside in India. The endangered big cat was crouching in the snow on a tree-dotted slope at Gulmarg Resorts in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir. Owen Lansbury, a 42-year-old Australian, was in a group of five skiers when he caught the astonishing sight on his head camera. Advertisement Lansbury posted a video from the encounter on Facebook last Thursday, and it's now going viral. The footage shows the animal almost completely camouflaged by the white powder. \"I stopped just as it huddled in the snow, where it stayed for about a minute, checking us out ,\" he told the India Times. Advertisement \"It then let out a solid roar and bounded away down the slope towards [American tour guide Dave Marchi], but scooted off into the forest, where we think it probably had a kill stashed.\" \"Pretty amazing experience,\" he added. Here's Lansbury's full unedited video, now on Vimeo. Asked if he was scared when he saw the animal, Lansbury said the leopard was probably more frightened than he was. Advertisement \" It was hiding in the snow and was watching us and waiting for a moment to run,\" he told The Indian Express. There are only 6,000 wild snow leopards left in the world. According to the World Wildlife Fund, their numbers have dropped by 20 percent in the last 20 years, mainly due to loss of habitat, poaching and climate change. Snow leopards can usually be found at altitudes of 9,000 to 16,000 feet in the mountains of Central Asia, with an estimated 200 to 600 living in India. They grow up to 5 feet long and can weigh up to 120 pounds. Advertisement There have only been two reported cases of snow leopards attacking humans since 1940. Neither were fatal . Snow leopards aren't the only danger in the region, however. Many governments, including the U.S. , advise citizens not to travel to Jammu and Kashmir , which borders Pakistan , due to civil unrest and the threat of terrorism. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

People Die Waiting For Organs. Here's How To Stop That From Happening Tune in to a conversation with experts on organ transplants at Harvard's School of Public Health. By Casey Williams On assignment for HuffPost May 20, 2016, 11:49 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT More than 121,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for an organ transplant. Some will sit in limbo for as many as five years before receiving an organ. Others won\u2019t live long enough to reach the top of the waiting list: every day in the U.S., 22 people die while waiting for a live-saving transplant. There\u2019s no easy solution to the twin problems of organ scarcity and staggering waiting times for transplants. Advertisement Recruiting more living donors could help shrink wait times. But donating an organ is no easy task . Donors are covered by the recipient\u2019s insurance for the actual procedure but are barred by law from receiving money to cover their travel costs or to pay for their recovery. The hefty financial burden often dissuades would-be donors from contributing their organs. Deciding who gets an organ when is tricky business as well. When an organ becomes available, potential recipients who live nearby and whose blood type matches the organ usually get first priority. Hospitals also allocate organs based on how urgently patients need them . But there's still much debate over how best to match and distribute organs. In a panel discussion hosted by Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health on Friday, experts will discuss these and other issues. They\u2019ll address organ scarcity, the ethics of matching and allocating organs and strategies for reducing the need for organ transplants in the first place. Advertisement They\u2019ll also discuss technological innovations that have allowed scientists to produce artificial organs, as well as controversies around the organ markets that exist in some countries, and the thorny ethics of presumed consent rules, which allow doctors in some countries, though not the U.S., to presume that patients have consented to donating their organs unless they say otherwise. The panel, presented by the Dr. Lawrence H. and Roberta Cohn Forums, will include Dr. Francis Delmonico, professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital Transplant Center; Dr. Daniel Wikler, professor of ethics and population health at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health; Dr. Doris Taylor, director of regenerative medicine research at the Texas Heart Institute; and Dr. James Yoo, professor at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA Rocketed Human Sperm Into Space International Space Station scientists will determine how well the sperm perform in zero gravity. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Apr 14, 2018, 10:42 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING NASA has sent samples of human sperm to the International Space Station to study how fertilization could happen in space. The mission, called Micro-11, rocketed frozen human sperm \u2014 and bull sperm for a comparison \u2014 to the space station early this month. The aim? NASA wants to know: \u201cDo sperm squirm the same in space?\u201d Advertisement Lack of gravity affects human sperm motility and fertility. During fertilization for mammals, the activated sperm swims to fuse with an egg, and it faces a vastly different environment depending on gravity. Earlier studies for other types of sperm have pinpointed a number of issues in space. Experiments with sperm from sea urchins and bulls have suggested that \u201cactivating movement happens more quickly in microgravity, while the steps leading up to fusion happen more slowly \u2014 or not at all,\u201d NASA explained. \u201cDelays or problems at this stage could prevent fertilization from happening in space.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Blind People See Race Differently, And Perhaps More Wisely A new study finds that lack of vision may help clarify the truth. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 25, 2015, 03:03 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Novastock via Getty Images Most of us take note of another person's race. We check it off almost automatically, and we do it based on looks. But blind people can't make such snap visual judgments. New research suggests that how they attribute race offers some lessons for sighted people. Advertisement The small study, conducted by sociologists at the University of Delaware, examined race attribution in 25 blind people, including those who were born blind and those who lost their sight later in life. In interviews with the participants, researchers identified two common qualities to non-visual race attribution: The judgments are non-immediate and uncertain. For starters, a blind person typically attributes race to someone following an interaction with that person, whereas a sighted individual generally assigns race before learning anything else about the person. \"The respondents described a slower process of assigning race, one that unfolds only after and through interaction,\" Asia Friedman, a sociologist at the university and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post. \"This means that the assignment of race typically only occurs in contexts of direct interaction, not in situations of simple co-presence without interaction -- such as passing on the street, waiting in line, sitting in a crowd.\" Advertisement As a result, blind people end up categorizing fewer people based on race than sighted people do, with even individuals of their acquaintance remaining \"unraced.\" Secondly, blind people experience greater uncertainty in their race assignments. \"All of the respondents referenced the ambiguity of race in some way, and many... said that they are unable to attribute race most of the time,\" Friedman said. \"Expressions of uncertainty such as ' Most of the time, I can\u2019t tell ,' ' I don\u2019t necessarily know all the time ,' ' I might not even know ,' ' You really can\u2019t say 100 percent ,' and ' I\u2019m fairly certain ' were quite common.\" This uncertainty can have positive effects. For instance, most of the participants said they believed being blind made them less likely to rely on racial stereotypes. Advertisement What the study reminds all of us is that first looks don't reflect the wide-ranging reality of individual differences. Friedman said she hopes that the findings \"challenge visual meanings that are so often taken as self-evident.\" \"I hope the research provokes people to think more about the effects of holding a visual understanding of race, and to consider whether the 'realness' and 'self-evidence' of race is only tenable when race is seen,\" she said. And if you're wondering how the study participants did assign race in the absence of visual cues? Voice and name were the two most common cues, according to Friedman. Advertisement The study findings were presented on Aug. 25 at the American Sociological Association's annual meeting in Chicago.

This Is What The Center Of Our Galaxy Looks Like Astronomers take an unprecedented, x-ray view of the black hole in the center of the Milky Way. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 22, 2015, 08:11 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The central regions of our galaxy, the Milky Way, seen in x-rays by ESA\u2019s XMM-Newton X-ray observatory. ESA/XMM-Newton/G. Ponti et al. 2015 This new, unprecedented image of the Milky Way shows that our galaxy's core is a pretty tumultuous place. The compiled image of photos taken by the European Space Agency's x-ray satellite XMM-Newton (above) spans 1,000 light-years in the center of the galaxy, and shows dying stars, powerful winds, hot gas and, most notably, a supermassive black hole. Advertisement The galactic black hole, dubbed Sagittarius A*, and its surrounding emission are located in the brightest central region of the image. Black holes don't emit light. But as the objects that surround Sagittarius A* in the Milky Way's center are pulled in by the black hole's strong gravitational grasp, the interaction emits light at various wavelengths, including x-rays. (Story continues below.) This magnification shows the central 100 light-years of the galaxy's violent core. Here, only soft x-ray emissions are shown. MPE/ESA Advertisement After analyzing the image, an international team of astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics has not only concluded that the center of the galaxy is a dramatic place, but that Sagittarius A* may be partly to blame for the tumult. The black hole is so ginormous that it has a mass a few million times that of our sun. T he new image of our galaxy's center may provide important insight into how our Milky Way and its black hole are evolving. A paper describing the new image was published online in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on August 19, 2015.

There's One Letter In The Alphabet That Almost No One Can Write Meet the most mysterious letter in the English language. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 4, 2018, 05:13 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It\u2019s a letter everyone can read, but a new study finds almost no one can write it. The lowercase letter \u201cg\u201d has two forms: the \u201copentail\u201d one most people use, and the \u201clooptail\u201d form commonly seen in print and online in fonts such as Times New Roman and Calibri: HuffPost Advertisement Researchers from Johns Hopkins University found that while everyone can read the looptail g just fine, most people can\u2019t write it or even correctly identify when it\u2019s on its own. \u201cWe think that if we look at something enough, especially if we have to pay attention to its shape as we do during reading, then we would know what it looks like,\u201d Johns Hopkins cognitive scientist Michael McCloskey, the study\u2019s senior author, said in a news release. \u201cBut our results suggest that\u2019s not always the case .\u201d When presented with four versions of it \u2015 three of them incorrect \u2015 7 out of 25 people were able to pick the right \u201cg.\u201d Advertisement \u201cThey don\u2019t entirely know what this letter looks like, even though they can read it,\u201d said cognitive science graduate student Gali Ellenblum. \u201cThis is not true of letters in general. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d You can test yourself here: In another experiment, only 2 of 38 adults named \u201cg\u201d when they were asked to list letters with two lowercase forms, and only one could write both. Advertisement \u201cWe would say: \u2018There\u2019re two forms of g. Can you write them?\u2019 And people would look at us and just stare for a moment because they had no idea,\u201d Kimberly Wong, a junior undergraduate at Johns Hopkins, said in a news release. \u201cOnce you really nudged them on, insisting there are two types of g, some would still insist there is no second g.\u201d In yet another experiment, 16 people were given a paragraph that showed the looptail g 14 times. Respondents were asked to speak each word aloud, then researchers requested that they write the letter. Half wrote the opentail form anyway, and while the rest attempted the looptail g, only one wrote it correctly. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Tens Of Thousands Of Sharks Pack Florida Coast \"You could throw a pebble and literally strike a shark.\" By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Feb 14, 2016, 03:26 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Sharks off Palm Beach, FL Fantastic aerial survey flight this morning.  Thousands of sharks off Palm Beach and up to Jupiter.  Very few sharks spotted from Miami to Palm Beach.  Really looking forward to instrumenting some sharks with transmitters tomorrow.  Original 4K video uploaded for viewing - be sure to watch in HD. Posted by FAU Shark Migration on Friday, February 12, 2016 Dreaming of a Florida vacation? You\u2019re not the only one. Tens of thousands of blacktip sharks are gathering off Florida\u2019s southeast coast, as documented in astonishing photos and video by researchers recording the sharks' seasonal migration to warmer water. \"There are literally tens of thousands of sharks a stone's throw away from our shoreline. You could throw a pebble and literally strike a shark. They are that close,\" Stephen Kajiura, the head of Florida Atlantic University's shark lab, told CBS12. Advertisement The sightings are primarily near Palm Beach. While the news may not be especially welcoming to the area\u2019s tourists, who are also flocking to the coastal communities to escape the cold, Kajiura and his team of researchers are having a field day studying the creatures.

Great conditions -- water was calm, flat, clear, and loaded with sharks,\u201d they posted to their Shark Migration Facebook page Saturday. Advertisement The caption of an aerial photo on their Instagram account reads: \u201cLucky paddle boarder (lower left) about to encounter hundreds of sharks.\u201d Blacktip sharks are known to attack people and are believed to be responsible for most of the shark attacks reported in the sunshine state. Fortunately, none of the attacks have been fatal, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Kajiura, who has been studying and documenting the sharks' location for the past several years, stressed that there have been \u201crelatively few bites.\u201d Advertisement Successfully tagged 5 blacktip sharks with acoustic transmitters this morning.  Great conditions - water was calm, flat, clear, and loaded with sharks. Posted by FAU Shark Migration on Saturday, February 13, 2016 \u201cEven though we have this huge number of sharks -- tens of thousands of them immediately adjacent to shore here in South Florida -- we have relatively few bites,\u201d he told the Palm Beach Daily News. \u201cWhen you consider the number of people in the water and the number of sharks in the water you\u2019d think there would be a lot of interaction.\u201d The FAU associate professor said his team is focusing their study on the blacktip sharks\u2019 habitat. \u201cYou have this large seasonal influx of these top-level predators, and they are going to have a dramatic impact on the local ecosystem,\u201d he said.

LEAVE A COMMENT This series of images composited together shows the 2008 solar eclipse as viewed from Novosibirsk, Russia. (Kalan, CC BY 3.0; https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Kalan) Co-authored by Megan Watzke On August 21st, a total solar eclipse will be visible from Oregon to South Carolina . This event will be a once-in-a-lifetime event for millions in the United States who will get to experience what happens, for a brief period of time, when day turns to night . The last time the U.S. had such a coast-to-coast view of a total solar eclipse was almost 100 years ago . There will be many articles about the majesty and importance of total solar eclipses in the coming weeks, leading up to the momentous event. This list, however, outlines perhaps lesser-known things about the phenomenon that makes total solar eclipses possible: light. Advertisement 1.An eclipse is when an object in space obscures or blocks the light from another object. An eclipse can be thought of as a cosmic shadow or as light that does not pass (invoke your best Gandalf impersonation here). In March 2006, astronauts on board the International Space Station photographed the shadow of our Moon as it fell on Earth near the Mediterranean Sea during a total solar eclipse. (NASA) 2.We find shadows in many different places here on Earth (an umbrella blocking your sunlight at a beach, shade from trees, etc.), but shadows occur on much larger scales as well. Scientists see light being blocked across planets, giant gas clouds, and more. Advertisement 3.Many of us think of light as the stuff we can see with our human eyes. In fact, radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays are all different flavors of light, beyond what humans can detect. 4.While we are most familiar with the \u201cvisible light\u201d given off by the Sun , our nearest star also produces light from radio waves to gamma rays. Think of ultraviolet light, which is the source of sunburns, or infrared light, which delivers heat. Luckily for us, Earth\u2019s atmosphere blocks more energetic light (X-rays, etc.) from reaching life down here on the surface. Our Sun produces many kinds of light, such as ultraviolet and X-ray light. These images from NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory show a solar flare (the bright spot on the left part of the Sun in each panel) from 2014 in five different wavelengths of light. (NASA/SDO) Advertisement 5.Shadows can take place using all of these different kinds of light. For example, an X-ray at the doctor\u2019s or dentist\u2019s office involves looking at the shadow left by the dense bone to see if there are any issues with it. 6.Scientists can also use shadows to study different kinds of cosmic objects. Much of the preliminary information gained about thousands of planets outside of our Solar System \u2013 \u201c exoplanets \u201d \u2013 has been through studying blocked light via the \u201c transit method .\u201d 7.Nothing travels faster than light. In a vacuum, it moves at about 300,000 km per second or 670 million miles per hour. This means that it takes over 8 minutes for light from our Sun to reach Earth. Advertisement 8.Most objects, including our own planet and celestial objects like the Moon, do not give off their own visible light. Instead, they reflect and absorb light from a source that does, such as our Sun or a light bulb. (Depending on their internal structure, some planets can generate other types of light such as infrared.) Our Moon shines because it\u2019s reflecting a certain percentage (about 3-12%) of the light that hits it from our Sun. (Daniel Hershman, CC BY 2.0) 9.We see objects as a certain color because they reflect that color and absorb the others. For example, plants look green because they have absorbed the other colors (red, blue, etc.) from sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. Advertisement 10.The path of light can be bent. This is called refraction and it\u2019s responsible for everything from red sunsets to colorful rainbows. BONUS: Without light, particularly that from our Sun, life as we know it would not exist. These are just a few fun things to consider before our Sun temporarily goes dark on August 21st, 2017. A solar eclipse like the one many in America will be able to experience that day -- assuming the weather cooperates -- provides an excellent opportunity to reflect (pun intended!) on the wonders of light and what it does for us. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Video May Help You Wrap Your Head Around 'Quantum Foam' Thanks, NASA! By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 4, 2016, 11:10 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT What is \"quantum foam,\" anyway? Most physics buffs have heard of the space-time concept, which suggests that empty space as we tend to think of it isn't empty at all . Rather, at very small scales, space and time can be a bit \"fuzzy\" or \"bubbly,\" kind of like foam. \"The 'bubbles' in the quantum foam are quadrillions of times smaller than atomic nuclei and last for infinitesimal fractions of a second -- or in \u2018quantum-speak,\u2019 the size of a Planck Length for a Planck Time ,\" Dr. Eric Perlman, professor of physics and space sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology, said in a statement. \"According to string theorists, this requires an additional six dimensions. Space-time itself is fluctuating in these regions.\" Advertisement Got that? To make things a bit clearer, watch the new NASA video above, which offers an in-depth explanation of quantum foam .

Belize's 'Blue Hole' May Help Solve Mystery Of Maya Downfall Famous 'Blue Hole' May Help Solve Mystery Of Maya Downfall By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 1, 2015, 11:17 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists know all about the sophisticated calendars and writing system of the Maya, as well as their ritual sacrifices. But as for exactly what caused the the ancient civilization to collapse around 900 A.D., that's long been a bit of a mystery. Now a team of researchers from Rice University and Louisiana State University think they may be one step closer to cracking the mystery, thanks in part to evidence from the \"Great Blue Hole.\" The massive sinkhole located in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Belize was made popular by pioneering conservationist Jacques Cousteau, who visited it in 1971 and declared it one of the world's best scuba diving sites. The researchers analyzed sediment samples from the Blue Hole , looking specifically at variations in color, grain size, and layer thickness . They also examined samples from the Belize Central Shelf Lagoon , a body of water attached to the mainland, noting differences in the samples' ratio of titanium to aluminum, which helps provide an estimate for rainfall levels. Advertisement The analyses revealed low levels of precipitation and a drop in the frequency of tropical cyclones from 800 to 900 A.D. in the Yucatan peninsula--which suggests the region was hit by a major drought at the time, the researchers told The Huffington Post in an email. The research also suggested that another major drought hit the region between 1000 and 1100 A.D., around when the Maya city of Chichen Itza is believed to have fallen. \"When you have major droughts, you start to get famines and unrest,\" study co-author Dr. Andr\u00e9 Droxler, an earth scientist at Rice, told Live Science. Advertisement The research on the lagoon was presented on Dec. 16 at the American Geophysical Union's 2014 Fall Meeting in San Francisco, and the study on the Blue Hole samples was published Jan. 2014 in the journal Scientific Reports. The research builds upon previous studies suggesting climate change precipitated the Mayas' downfall. A 2012 study of a stalagmite from a cave in Belize linked the region's population collapse to a \"drying trend\" between 600 and 1000 A.D. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Friendships May Play A Huge Role In Depression Recovery We get by with a little help from our friends. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 22, 2015, 08:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Shutterstock / isarescheewin It's not always easy to know how to help a friend who's struggling with depression. It turns out that just being there for that person might be the best thing that you can do, according to a new British study. Research from the Universities of Manchester and Warwick, published this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Academy , suggests that being around people with healthy moods can play a major role in the recovery of individuals with depressive symptoms, ranging from low mood to clinical depression. Spending time with people who are depressed, however, doesn't make a healthy person any more likely to become depressed themselves. Advertisement In other words, good moods may be contagious -- but bad ones aren't. \"There is a lot of evidence that people influence each others\u2019 mood,\" Dr. Thomas House, an applied mathematician at Manchester and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"We tried to quantify that in the context of depression in adolescents.\" For the study, scientists used an infectious disease model to track the spread of mood among U.S. high school students, allowing them to examine the effect of a person's friendships on their ability to recover from depression. The model showed that being around friends with healthy moods reduces a teen's likelihood of developing depression by 50 percent . Among teens with depression, being in the presence of positive people increased their chances of recovering from the condition by 50 percent over a period of six to 12 months. Advertisement \"Having sufficient friends with healthy mood essentially doubled depressed people\u2019s chances of recovery,\" House said. They also found that depression does not seem to spread from person to person -- debunking the common myth that depression is \"contagious.\" While psychologists have long known that social connections play a role in emotional well-being, exactly how important healthy social connections are for teenagers has been less clear. Research has shown that social isolation and loneliness are major risk factors for developing depression, and on the other hand, social support can be key to depression prevention and recovery . Advertisement The doubled chance of depression recovery found in the study is a significant effect, and the findings suggest that high school students may benefit greatly from social interventions for preventing depression. More than 10 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds have experienced at least one major depressive episode. \"More work needs to be done but it may [be] that we could significantly reduce the burden of depression through cheap, low-risk social interventions,\" House said in a written statement . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Meet The Most Powerful Woman In Particle Physics Fabiola Gianotti has some very big goals. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post May 18, 2016, 01:47 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Fabiola Gianotti, CERN's new director-general Christian Beutler Fabiola Gianotti isn't new to CERN , the Geneva, Switzerland-based research organization that operates the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest particle collider. In fact, the Italian particle physicist was among the CERN scientists who made history in 2012 with the discovery of the Higgs boson . But now Gianotti isn't just working at CERN. As the organization's new director-general -- the first woman ever to hold the position -- she's running the show. And though expanding our knowledge of the subatomic realm remains her main focus, she's acutely aware that she is now a high-visibility role model for women around the world. Advertisement \"Physics is widely regarding as a male-dominated field, and it's true that there are more men in our community than women,\" Gianotti told The Huffington Post in an email. \"So I am glad if in my new role I can contribute to encourage young women to undertake a job in scientific research with the certitude that they have the same opportunities as men.\" Recently, HuffPost Science posed a few questions to Gianotti via email. Here, lightly edited, are her answers. How will things be different for you in your new role? My new role is very interesting and stimulating, and I feel very honored to have been offered it. The range of issues I have to deal with is much broader than before and includes scientific strategy and planning, budget, personnel aspects, relations with a large variety of stakeholders, etc. Days are long and full, and I am learning many new things. And there is nothing more enriching and gratifying than learning. Advertisement What's a typical day like for you? Super-hectic, super-speedy and ... atypical! What do you think explains the gender gap in science generally and in physics particularly? There are many factors. There's no difference in ability between men and women, that's for sure. And in my experience, the more diverse a team is, the stronger it is. There is the baggage of history, of course, which takes a long time to overcome. There is the question of the lack of role models, and there is the question of making workplaces more family friendly. We need to enable parents, men or women, to take breaks to raise families and we need to support parents with infrastructure and facilities. The Large Hadron Collider, Geneva, Switzerland. View Pictures via Getty Images Your term as CERN's director-general is scheduled to last five years. What are your goals for CERN during this period? Advertisement The second run of the LHC is the top priority for CERN in the coming years. We got off to a very good start in 2015, and have three years of data-taking ahead of us before we go into the accelerator's second long shutdown. The experiments are expected to record at least three times more data than in Run 1 at an energy almost twice as large. It will be a long time before another such step in energy will be made in the future. So, the coming years are going to be an exciting period for high-energy physics. But CERN is not just the LHC. We have a variety of experiments and facilities, including precise measurements of rare decays and detailed studies of antimatter, to mention just a couple of them. In parallel with the ongoing program, we will be working to ensure a healthy long-term future for CERN, at first with the high-luminosity LHC upgrade scheduled to come on stream in the middle of the next decade, and also through a range of design studies looking at the post-LHC era -- from 2035 onwards. What discoveries can we reasonably expect from CERN during your term? I'm afraid that I don't have a crystal ball to hand. There will be a wealth of excellent physics results from the LHC Run 2 and from other CERN experiments. We'll certainly get to know the Higgs boson much better and expand our exploration of physics beyond the Standard Model . Whether we find any hints of the new physics everyone is so eagerly waiting for, however, I don't know. We know there's new physics to be found. Good as it is, the Standard Model explains only the 5 percent of the universe that is visible. There are so many exciting questions still waiting to be answered. Advertisement \u201cThere is nothing more enriching and gratifying than learning.\u201d - Fabiola Gianotti, CERN director-general What are the biggest opportunities at CERN? The biggest challenges? These two questions have a single answer. Over the coming years, the greatest opportunities and challenges, not only for CERN but for the global particle physics community as a whole, come from the changing nature of the field. Collaboration between regions is growing. CERN recently signed a set of agreements with the U.S. outlining U.S. participation in the upgrade of the LHC and CERN participation in neutrino projects at Fermilab in the U.S. There are also emerging players in the field, notably China, whose scientific community has expressed ambitious goals for a potential future facility. All this represents a great opportunity for particle physics. The challenge for all of us in the field is to advance in a globally coordinated manner, so as to be able to carry out as many exciting and complementary projects as possible. Advertisement Were you always interested in being a scientist? If you couldn't be a scientist, what would you be/do? I was always interested in science, and I was always interested in music. I pursued both for as long as I could, but when the time came to make a choice, I chose science. I suppose that as a professional physicist, it is still possible to enjoy music -- I still play the piano from time to time. But as a professional musician, it would be harder to engage in science. What do you do in your spare time? I spend my little spare time with family and friends. I do some sport, I listen to music, I read. What do you think is the biggest misconception nonscientists have about particle physics? That it's hard to understand! Of course, if you want to be a particle physicist, you have to master the language of mathematics and be trained to quite a high level. But if you want to understand the field conceptually, it's almost child's play. All children are natural scientists. They are curious, and they want to take things apart to see how they work. Advertisement Particle physics is just like that. We study the fundamental building blocks of matter from which everything is made, and the forces at work between them. And the equations that describe the building blocks and their interactions are simple and elegant. They can be written on a small piece of paper.

This Easy Trick Can Boost Your Mood And Help You Avoid Colds Oddly enough, it can improve your performance in job interviews and at work, too. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Oct 12, 2015, 05:36 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT When a friend compliments you, it puts a smile on your face. But it might do more than that. New research shows that compliments can boost your immune system and improve your on-the-job performance and relationships with co-workers. \"These relatively small interventions had such powerful effects on people\u2019s physiology...as well as their creativity,\" Dr. Daniel Cable, professor of organizational behavior at London Business School and lead author of this study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"I was surprised how much it changed their relationship with their employer.\" Advertisement Cable and his colleagues drew their conclusion from three separate experiments. In the first experiment, 123 men and women participated in mock job interviews. Before the interviews, one third of the participants received a hand-written note from a friend containing compliments like \u201cYou are unafraid to be intelligent... I can think of a time when you won an argument with class, and I found it inspirational.\u201d One-third of the participants received a neutral note, and one-third wrote down their own strengths. What happened? Those who had received a friend's note performed much better in the interview, as judged by a pair of observers. In the second study, 75 people solved puzzles and did creative thinking exercises, such as coming up with new uses for an old newspaper. Advertisement Before the tests, half of the participants received notes from friends, family, or coworkers describing \"when they witnessed the participant at his or her best.\" Those participants performed better on the tests than did participants who didn't get such notes--and saliva samples taken from them afterward suggested that the notes had boosted their immune function. In the final experiment, employees reminded of their past accomplishments at the time of their hiring felt significantly less burnt when surveyed one year later. As Julia Lee, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan School of Business and a co-author of this study, told The Huffington Post in an email, these workers were \"less likely to believe that they just do the work for money.\" Advertisement What's the take-away? Next time you're going into a job interview, ask your mom or BFF to write you a nice note about that time you aced a test or saved the day.

An Iceberg The Size Of Rome May Have Killed 150,000 Penguins (UPDATE) But one penguin researcher says they may have just relocated. By Sebastian Murdock Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 13, 2016, 02:43 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT An Adelie penguin. Wolfgang Kaehler/Getty Images A massive iceberg that became grounded near a colony of penguins in Antarctica may have caused more than 150,000 of the birds to die after leaving them landlocked. In December 2010, an iceberg measuring more than 1,100 square miles -- the size of the city of Rome -- crossed into the bay near Cape Denison where a massive colony of Adelie penguins lived, according to The Guardian. Advertisement With the arrival of the iceberg, breeding Adelie penguins near the cape must now travel almost 40 miles in search of food. The exhausting trek has caused the colony to diminish from 160,000 penguins to just 10,000 , an alarming new study by Antarctic Science found. Adelie and Chinstrap penguins walk along snowbank on Laurie Island in 1994. Wolfgang Kaehler/Getty Images Chris Turney, a climate change professor with the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, has been tracking the penguin decline. Advertisement \"It's eerily silent now,\" Turney told the Sydney Morning Herald. \"The ones that we saw at Cape Denison were incredibly docile, lethargic, almost unaware of your existence. The ones that are surviving are clearly struggling. They can barely survive themselves, let alone hatch the next generation. We saw lots of dead birds on the ground ... it's just heartbreaking to see.\" However, a penguin researcher who was not involved in the study said there is no definitive proof that the penguins have died. They may have just relocated. \"Just because there are a lot fewer birds observed doesn't automatically mean the ones that were there before have perished,\" Michelle LaRue, who studies penguin populations at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, told Live Science. \"They easily could have moved elsewhere, which would make sense if nearby colonies are thriving.\" Advertisement If it's true that 93 percent of the penguin population is already dead, researchers estimate that in 20 years the rest of the colony will be completely wiped out. But even so, LaRue told The Weather Network the colony accounts for just a small portion of the 3.8 million breeding pairs of Adelie penguins worldwide. \"150,000, even lets [sic] just assume they did all die, that certainly is not apocalyptic,\" LaRue told the publication. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Saturn's Moon Enceladus May Have Warm Ocean, Boosting Likelihood Of Life On Icy Satellite Life-Friendly Hot Springs May Hide Beneath Icy Moon's Crust By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 12, 2015, 05:43 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have found yet another tantalizing clue that Saturn's moon Enceladus may have the potential to host alien life: Hot springs. Yes, new research reveals the first clear evidence that there could be hydrothermal activity in the icy moon's underground ocean . Advertisement (Story continues below images.) Dramatic plumes on Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, as seen by the Cassini probe during its flyby in 2009. A deep subsurface ocean is thought to exist at the south pole of Enceladus, below a thick ice crust. This artist\u2019s impression shows hydrothermal activity on the ocean floor. \u201cThese findings add to the possibility that Enceladus ... could contain environments suitable for living organisms ,\u201d John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C., said in a written statement issued by the agency. \u201cThe locations in our solar system where extreme environments occur in which life might exist may bring us closer to answering the question: are we alone in the universe.\u201d Advertisement Tiny grains yield their secrets. For the research, an international team of scientists analyzed data on microscopic grains of rock, which were spewed into space by Enceladus's geysers and collected by NASA's Cassini space probe's cosmic dust analyzer (CDA) instrument. The analysis, along with computer simulations and experiments in the lab, suggested that the silica grains were formed in Enceladus's vast ocean. Scientists discovered this ocean, which is at least as big as North America's Lake Superior , last April. According to the new hypothesis, minerals from Enceladus's rocky core dissolved in hot water near the seafloor -- estimated to be around 194 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius). As the hot water rose toward the ocean's surface, it cooled, causing the minerals to condense into the tiny silica grains -- just like the ones found in sand and quartz on Earth. Advertisement The search for E.T. The new research suggests that Enceladus has three main ingredients needed for life to evolve: water, heat, and nutrients. Just last year, scientists mapped out 101 geysers of water vapor and ice near Enceladus's south pole. And given that the moon isn't the only one of its kind, this has intriguing implications for the possibility of life elsewhere in the Milky Way. \u201c Enceladus may even represent a very common habitat in the galaxy : icy moons around giant gas planets, located well beyond the \u2018habitable zone\u2019 of a star, but still able to maintain liquid water below their icy surface,\u201d Nicolas Altobelli, a Cassini project scientist, said in a written statement issued by the European Space Agency. Advertisement Researchers are eager to examine samples from Enceladus to determine whether life exists there, though that may take years. \"It will take more than 20 years to send a space probe to Enceladus and bring samples back to Earth ,\" Dr. Yasuhito Sekine, an associate professor at the University of Tokyo and one of the researchers behind the new finding, told Reuters. \"So we're taking a long breath until we finally get the sample in our hands -- maybe more than 30 years -- but hopefully by the end of this century, we will reach the conclusion.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Think Weather Forecasts Are Bad? Try Forecasting A Volcanic Eruption. A new technique could bring us closer to accurately predicting volcano behavior.

LEAVE A COMMENT By Mary Beth Griggs Satellite data from Okmuk volcano in Alaska shows how much the ground was deformed after an eruption. Courtesy of the Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre). Forecasting the weather is hard enough \u2014 just ask any meteorologist . But imagine how difficult it would be if all the data you needed to help build tomorrow\u2019s weather map was located deep underground, utterly inaccessible, and you had to use a totally different model for each location because the rules that governed the weather in Houston, Texas were vastly different from the rules that governed the weather in Boise, Idaho. Those are just some of the challenges volcanologists face when trying to accurately predict volcanic eruptions in the same way we frequently forecast storms. But as intense as those challenges are, the widespread ubiquity of GPS technology and other remote-sensing tech has made them more surmountable today than they were decades ago. Advertisement In a study published Wednesday in Frontiers in Earth Science Mary Grace Bato, a volcanology PhD student at the Institut des Sciences de la Terre (ISTerre) in France, and colleagues detailed how weather forecasting techniques can be applied to volcanic eruptions, potentially setting the stage for volcano forecasts to show up alongside weather reports in places like Alaska or Iceland. Currently, many volcanoes around the world are monitored for signs of activity (though some of these programs are set to have their funding cut ). Monitoring can help cities, towns, and residents prepare for an eruption, and can save lives when monitoring stations detect that an eruption may be imminent. Evacuations by local governments ahead of the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo saved over 5,000 lives, for instance. \u201cEvacuations by local governments ahead of the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo saved over 5,000 lives, for instance.\u201d Advertisement But real-time volcano monitoring is still not nearly as robust as weather forecasting. \u201cWe can look at a volcano and monitor it,\u201d Bato says, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the capability to forecast the long term or short term evolution of the volcano.\u201d This is where GPS comes in. Satellites can now track movements in the ground, and the position of the ground over time. This is important because the vast reservoirs of magma under a volcano are nearly impossible to directly observe, and have to be monitored based on the movements they cause on the Earth\u2019s surface. To envision a magma reservoir, Bato says you should \u201cthink of a balloon under the volcano, where the air is the magma.\u201d Advertisement As that \u2018balloon\u2019 inflates with magma rushing into the reservoir, it pushes against the overlying layers of rock and soil. \u201cUsing real GPS data, we can see the volcano is inflating,\u201d Bato says. That\u2019s one of the signs that an eruption might be imminent. In this new study, Bato and her colleagues showed that by combining GPS data from satellites with an existing model of how a volcano functions, and applying applying weather forecasting techniques \u2014 also called data assimilation \u2014 they could predict what situations would lead to an eruption. That\u2019s similar to how meteorologists take real-time data and measurements from around the world and combine them with weather models to predict the track of a storm or a heat wave. Advertisement While weather models are fairly robust \u2014 though there are still disagreements about which one is better \u2014 volcanology models are in much earlier stages of development, and a model that applies to a volcano in Hawaii won\u2019t necessarily apply to a volcano in Indonesia or Russia. But Bato\u2019s technique is flexible. \u201cThe good thing about this technique is that you can change the model that you use. You can plug it in depending on what is appropriate for the volcano you want to observe,\u201d Bato says. All that\u2019s required is that the model has a temporal element that takes into account how the volcano behaves over time. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So far, the technique has only been applied to simulations, but Bato and colleagues are currently testing their method at Iceland\u2019s Grimsvotn volcano, which had a noticeable eruption in 2011, and Okmok, an Alaskan volcano. Advertisement Bato hopes that as volcanic eruption models become more robust, volcano forecasting might become more common, eventually helping people and communities living in the shadow of volcanoes be better prepared for the hazards they face. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road to get there, but it\u2019s a great beginning,\u201d Bato says.

Ancient Stone Tool Brings New Ideas About Early Americans Ancient Stone Tool Brings New Ideas About Early Americans By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 9, 2015, 09:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An ancient stone tool recently discovered in the high desert of southeast Oregon has archaeologists raising their eyebrows. The tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of agate, was unearthed from beneath a layer of volcanic ash near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management announced on Thursday. Archaeologists have linked the ash to a major eruption from Mount St. Helens that occurred about 15,800 years ago. \u201cWhen we had the volcanic ash identified, we were stunned because that would make this stone tool one of the oldest artifacts in North America ,\" Dr. Patrick O\u2019Grady, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon and the leader of the excavation, said in a written statement. \"Given those circumstances and the laws of stratigraphy, this object should be older than the ash.\u201d Advertisement (Story continues below photo.) The scraper was found at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern Oregon. It could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western North America. The new finding may rewrite the story of early human migrations, as it was once previously thought that the first humans in the western hemisphere arrived about 13,500 years ago . \u201cFor years, many in the archaeological field assumed that the first humans in the western hemisphere were the Clovis people \u2013 dating to around 13,000 years ago . While a handful of archaeological sites older than Clovis cultures have been discovered in the past few decades, there is still considerable scrutiny of any finding that appears older,\u201d Stan McDonald, the bureau's Oregon/Washington lead archaeologist, said in the statement. Advertisement If humans arrived more than 15,800 years ago, as the stone tool suggests, it would place humans in America's West around the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses, and bison roamed the region, the Associated Press reported. But some scientists remain skeptical. \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way ,\" Donald K. Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the excavation, told AP. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Mars Appears At Its Brightest Tonight As Planet Moves Into Opposition The phenomenon comes a week before Mars will make its closest approach to the Earth since 2005. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost May 22, 2016, 12:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The Hubble Space Telescope snapped this image of Mars just days before the red planet's opposition on May 22. NASA Get your telescopes ready -- tonight's sky is expected to be a bright one. Mars will be the brightest it\u2019s been in two years as it undergoes what\u2019s called Mars opposition, an orbital placement that puts the Earth directly between the sun and the Red Planet. As a result, Mars will be brightly illuminated by the sun's rays, making it the brightest object in the Earth's sky, just behind the sun and moon. Advertisement \"From our perspective on our spinning world, Mars rises in the east just as the sun sets in the west. Then, after staying up in the sky the entire night, Mars sets in the west just as the sun rises in the east,\" NASA explains on its website . It's a phenomenon that happens once every two years (or 26 months), about the time the Red Planet takes to completely orbit the sun. Advertisement On Sunday, NASA estimates that Mars will be 47.4 million miles away from the Earth. Amateur astronomer Dr. Ian Musgrave, from the University of Adelaide in Australia, has recommended stargazers use telescopes if they have the chance. \"From the point of view of someone standing around looking into the sky, it is just going to be a bright dot,\" he told Australia's ABC News. \"But even if you have a small telescope, the disc of Mars will be big enough to see details and maybe even the polar cap.\" Those who miss Sunday's event, worry not. Stargazers have May 30 to look forward to as well, when Mars will be the closest it's been to Earth since 2005. NASA/JPL-Caltech Advertisement May 30 is expected to be an even bigger show . That's when Mars will make its closest approach to the Earth since 2005, coming about 46.8 million miles away. That process is called the Mars Close Approach. From May 18 to June 3, the planet will appear brighter than usual because of its placement. By mid-June, it will start to become faint, as Mars and Earth move farther apart in their orbits around the sun, NASA explains . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Meteor Showers On Demand Could Be Coming Soon To Skies Near You Meteor Showers On Demand Could Be Coming Soon To Skies Near You By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 9, 2015, 05:44 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Part of the excitement of seeing a meteor is the dumb luck involved in being in the right place at the right time. Outside of known meteor showers, these celestial wonders don't exactly appear when you expect them to. But a Japanese company is hoping to change that, taking luck out of the equation and making meteors appear right on time, exactly where expected. Advertisement The company, called ALE, is raising funds to launch a small satellite filled with pellets that would orbit at about 250 to 300 miles above Earth. The satellite would release pellets on cue, which -- like natural meteoroids -- would burn up as they fall. Companies or individuals would be able to order a meteor or even a whole meteor shower, and have it appear on schedule. Lena Okajima of space startup ALE shows the pellets she says can be used to create artificial meteor showers. YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images Advertisement \"I'm thinking of streams of meteors that are rare in nature,\" Lena Okajima, the company's founder and CEO, told AFP. \"It is artificial but I want to make really beautiful ones that can impress viewers .\" Although she wouldn't reveal what the pellets are made of, Okajima said the company may be able to offer them in different colors. Okajima, who holds a doctorate degree in astronomy from the University of Tokyo, told AFP that the cost to develop and send the CubeSat into orbit would be about $8.2 million, and that the cost of a single artificial meteor would be about $8,200, based on the current exchange rate. Advertisement The artificial meteors could be used for science as well as a good show, she said. Since scientists would know exactly when and where the fake meteors would fall, they could use telescopes and other equipment to monitor each one. Okajima is hoping the blend of entertainment and science will help draw investors. \u201cWe believe there are people who would be ready to put up money for supporting \u2018a world first\u2019 event that is also meaningful scientifically,\u201d Okajima told AFP.

Chinese Space Station, Adrift For Years, Plummets To Earth The Tiangong-1 mostly burnt up as it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, but some pieces likely crashed into the Pacific ocean. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 2, 2018, 03:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A Chinese space station re-entered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere on Sunday, more than a year after the country lost contact with the school bus-sized structure, the China National Space Agency confirmed. Although the Tiangong-1 mostly burnt up upon re-entry, some pieces of the station likely crashed into the Pacific Ocean shortly after 5:15 p.m. Pacific time. U.S. Strategic Command confirmed the re-entry in a statement on Sunday evening. Advertisement \u201cOne of our missions, which we remain focused on, is to monitor space and the tens of thousands of pieces of debris that congest it,\u201d Maj. Gen. Stephen Whiting, deputy commander of the Joint Force Space Component Command (JFSCC), stated. \u201cAll nations benefit from a safe, stable, sustainable and secure space domain.\u201d The JFSCC does not track what happens to space debris after it re-enters the atmosphere. The Tiangong-1 station, which translates to \u201cheavenly palace\u201d in English, has been a topic of discussion among space-watchers for weeks after its fall towards Earth began to accelerate. Analysts said it was likely the 9.4-ton structure would tumble back home sometime between March 30 and April 2. Those predictions proved true on Sunday. Two crews of astronauts visited the Tiangong-1 station after it was launched in 2011. However, since March 2016, China has been unable to communicate with the station. Advertisement An astrophysicist told Reuters that about 10 percent of the station may have fallen into the ocean northwest of Tahiti. \u201cSmall bits definitely will have made it to the surface,\u201d Brad Tucker , a research fellow at Australian National University, said. \u201cMost likely the debris is in the ocean, and even if people stumbled over it, it would just look like rubbish in the ocean and be spread over a huge area of thousands of square kilometers.\u201d NW of Tahiti - it managed to miss the 'spacecraft graveyard' which is further south! pic.twitter.com/Sj4e42O7Dc \u2014 Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) April 2, 2018 Advertisement According to The New York Times, there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Most of the debris fell north of the Spacecraft Cemetery , where Russia\u2019s Mir station arrived in 2001. The Tiangong-2, China\u2019s other space station, remains in orbit. The country plans to complete another station by 2022, the state-run Xinhua News reported. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Space Junk Soars Across Sky In Video Filmed Using Selfie Stick Debris from a Russian rocket caused the spectacular sight, says scientist. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 3, 2016, 01:03 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Is it a plane? Is it a meteor? No, it's more likely to be debris from a Russian rocket. The space junk soars across the sky in a spectacular video filmed by a selfie stick user in Thailand. Video posted to YouTube by Charnchai Jardpimai shows him casually talking to the camera in a field in Phitsanulok province on Saturday. Advertisement But at the 54-second point, he suddenly spots something flying in the air and excitedly turns the lens toward it. The bright light shoots overhead for more than a minute before vanishing below the horizon. Jardpimai initially thought the object was a meteor, reports the Daily Telegraph. However, according to the Bangkok Post, the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand later stated it was more likely debris from a Russian rocket that had ejected after the launch of a weather satellite from Kazakhstan on Dec. 11. The institute's deputy director, Saran Poshayachinda, said the debris posed no danger to the Earth and is believed to have crash-landed in the Pacific Ocean. Advertisement Burning Soviet-era space junk similarly lit up the skies over Hawaii in August. Scientists are worried about the amount of trash floating around the Earth , and various solutions to clear it up are being proposed -- ranging from Pac-Man -style satellites to electrodynamic tethers .

By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Apr 21, 2018, 11:08 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Ever wanted to zoom near that central bulge in the Milky Way in the Sagittarius constellation where stars are born? NASA has almost made it possible thanks to the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope . As a kind of a 28th Hubble birthday gift for all of us, the space agency has posted astounding videos and photos of what\u2019s known as the Lagoon Nebula. The main video takes viewers from far away into the very heart of the massive, colorful nebula, what NASA calls a \u201craucous star nursery full of birth and destruction,\u201d 4,000 light-years away from Earth. Advertisement At the Lagoon Nebula\u2019s heart is a massive \u201cyoung\u201d star (the million-year-old Hershel 36), 200,000 times brighter and eight times hotter than Earth\u2019s sun. It roils the region with ultraviolet radiation and winds carving out an exploding, undulating \u201c fantasy landscape of ridges, cavities, and mountains of gas and dust,\u201d gushes NASA. The space agency has also released a video that dissolves to an infrared version that cuts through gas and dust to reveal a multitude of stars: Advertisement This is an imagined three-dimensional flight across the core of the Lagoon Nebula using images from Hubble: 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What Your Movements May Reveal About How You'll Get Along With Another Person People who have similar personalities tend to move in the same way, scientists find. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 24, 2016, 01:04 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Infrared cameras are used to study body movements at Euromov research center at Montpellier University in France. A new study suggests that people who display similar behavioral characteristics tend to move their bodies in the same way. Patrick Aventurier via Getty Images The way we move can offer a surprising level of insight into our personalities, according to new research . A team of European researchers recently found that each of us has an \"individual motor signature\" -- and this signature forms a blueprint for mapping out subtle differences in our movements compared to others, Dr. Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova, a professor of mathematics for health care at the University of Exeter in England and a co-author of the research, told The Huffington Post. Advertisement While the mechanics of human movement on a broad level has been well-studied, scientists have paid less attention to individual differences in movement, until now. \"We show that different individuals have different motor signatures,\" she said. \"In other words, individuals could be classified based on the way they move.\" Namely, the extent to which your movements are similar to another person\u2019s can determine how easily you can coordinate with that person and how similar your behaviors are. Advertisement The research, which was published in the journal Interface on Wednesday, involved a series of three experiments and about 82 participants. Some of the participants were asked to play a \"plain mirror game,\" in which two players imitated each other's movements, which were tracked and analyzed. It turned out that the players who were better at mimicking each other's movements -- including qualities like speed and weight of movement -- also exhibited more collective behaviors. By comparing the two individuals' movement signatures, the researchers could also determine the level of comfort and rapport in the relationship. Imitation is known to be important to our ability to develop friendships and form bonds with others. \"We know that when people move in synchrony -- marching, chanting, drumming, etc. -- it stimulates collaboration,\" said Carol Kinsey Goman, body language expert and author of The Silent Language of Leaders , who was not involved in the study. \"It is normal, human behavior to mirror the posture and movement of those we agree with and like.\" Advertisement These new findings suggest that people who are better able to sync their individual movement signatures with each other\u2019s have personalities that are more compatible. \"This study shows that people who move in a certain way, will also react in similar ways when they are performing joint tasks,\" Tsaneva-Atanasova said in a statement . \"Essentially, our movements give an insight into our inherent personality traits.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The researchers concluded that analyzing these motor signatures could one day offer a new pathway into diagnosing and treating mental illness, such as conditions involving social phobias. For instance, scientists could develop virtual reality technology in which a patient is asked to mimic the bodily movements of an avatar. Advertisement \"What we demonstrate is that ... movement gives an indication of a person's behavioral characteristics,\" Tsaneva-Atanasova said. \"This could therefore be used in the future to help diagnose patients with certain conditions by studying how they move and react to others.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

This Is The 'Most Eccentric' Planet Yet Known \u201cIt is a fascinating object!\u201d By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 24, 2016, 02:20 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An artist's rendering of the planet HD 20782, the most eccentric planet ever known, passing its star in close orbit. NASA Astronomers now know more about the universe's \"most eccentric\" planet than ever before. The exoplanet, named HD 20782b, is located about 117 light-years away and was first discovered in 2006 -- but a new study, which was released online before print and is slated to be published in The Astrophysical Journal, suggests that it's more extraordinary than previously thought. The planet not only looks somewhat similar to a comet in appearance, but it also orbits its host star like one too, Dr. Stephen Kane, an astronomer at San Francisco State University and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post on Thursday. Advertisement \"Most planets, including those in our own solar system, have orbits around their star that are shaped like a circle,\" Kane said. But HD 20782b's lengthy 597-day orbit slingshots it from a far away distance to just close enough to kiss its star. \"This planet is about the size of Jupiter but has an orbit like an ellipse, very similar to what we see for comets. That means that the planet spends most of its time far away from the star, but once per orbit it swings around the star very closely and almost touches the surface,\" Kane said. The orbit of HD 20782 is shown in red, relative to the inner planets of our own solar system. San Francisco State University Advertisement The researchers aren't sure how the planet ended up in such a bizarre orbit . It could possibly have been affected by the gravity of another planet that was once in the star system, Kane offered. Nonetheless, he was shocked when he came across data indicating the planet was in a highly elliptical orbit. \"The notion that a giant planet could exist in such extreme conditions is difficult to imagine,\" Kane said. \"Myself and my collaborators spent several years studying the object further to find out if the situation is as extreme as we initially thought.\" Kane and his colleagues noticed that flashes of light would reflect off the planet's atmosphere as it orbited its host star. So, they used a satellite-based telescope to collect that light data, all while timing their observations. Advertisement As the researchers detected changes in brightness of the light, they could measure the planet's distance from its star and the shape of its orbit. \"What we found is that, not only is the orbit the most eccentric ever found, the planet shows strong evidence of flashing reflected starlight at us whenever it makes its closest approach to the star,\" Kane said. \"It is a fascinating object!\" Now, the researchers hope to continue their observations in the future to get a closer look at what exactly is happening when HD 20782b makes its closest approach to its star. Advertisement \"When we see a planet like this that is in an eccentric orbit, it can be really hard to try and explain how it got that way,\" Kane said in a statement. \"We will learn how the planet heats up and cools down again and find out if this process is stripping the atmosphere away from the planet,\" he told HuffPost. \"Finding more of these kinds of planets,\" he added, \"will hopefully allow us to answer that question.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Is It The End Of The World As We Know It? It might be time to say goodbye to the Holocene epoch. By Rahel Gebreyes Editor, HuffPost Video May 17, 2016, 03:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING From our towering skyscrapers to our dependence on fossil fuels, it's no secret that humans are affecting our planet. But within the last decade or so, scientists have suggested that human activity may have actually pushed us into a totally new geologic epoch . The proposed new epoch is called the Anthropocene, and researchers -- armed with scientific evidence to show that this time period is distinct from the Holocene epoch -- are working to have it officially recognized. Advertisement In this episode of HuffPost\u2019s \u201cTalk Nerdy To Me,\u201d host Karah Preiss and Columbia University professor Peter de Menocal discuss what the development means and whether it's possible for us to change course before a sixth extinction becomes inevitable. Check out the video above to learn what a new epoch could signal about the Earth's future.

The Surprising Benefit Of Going Through Hard Times Psychologists studying post-traumatic growth find that many people come to thrive in the aftermath of adversity. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 2, 2016, 08:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT swissmediavision via Getty Images This excerpt is from the new book Wired to Create: Unravelling the Mysteries of the Creative Mind , by psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman and HuffPost Senior Writer Carolyn Gregoire. One of Frida Kahlo\u2019s most famous self-portraits depicts her in a hospital bed naked and bleeding, connected by a web of red veins to floating objects that include a snail, a flower, bones, and a fetus. Henry Ford Hospital , the 1932 surrealist painting, is a powerful artistic rendering of Kahlo\u2019s second miscarriage. Advertisement Kahlo wrote in her diaries that the painting \u201ccarries with it the message of pain.\u201d The painter was known for channeling the experience of multiple miscarriages, childhood polio, and a number of other misfortunes into her iconic self-portraits, and a real understanding of her work requires some knowledge of the suffering that motivated it. The phenomenon of art born from adversity can be seen not only in the lives of famous creators, but also in the lab. In the past 20 years, psychologists have begun studying post-traumatic growth, which has now been observed in more than 300 scientific studies. The term post-traumatic growth was coined in the 1990s by psychologists Richard Tedeschi and Lawrence Calhoun to describe instances of individuals who experienced profound transformation as they coped with various types of trauma and challenging life circumstances. Up to 70 percent of trauma survivors report some positive psychological growth, research has found. Advertisement Growth after trauma can take a number of different forms, including a greater appreciation for life, the identification of new possibilities for one\u2019s life, more satisfying interpersonal relationships, a richer spiritual life and a connection to something greater than oneself, and a sense of personal strength. A battle with cancer, for instance, can result in a renewed gratitude for one\u2019s family, while a near-death experience could be a catalyst for connecting with a more spiritual side of life. Psychologists have found that experiences of trauma also commonly lead to increased empathy and altruism, and a motivation to act for the benefit of others. Life After Trauma So how is it that out of suffering we can come to not only return to our baseline state but to deeply improve our lives? And why are some people crushed by trauma, while others thrive? Tedeschi and Calhoun explain that post-traumatic growth, in whatever form it takes, can be \u201can experience of improvement that is for some persons deeply profound.\u201d The two University of North Carolina researchers created the most accepted model of post-traumatic growth to date, which holds that people naturally develop and rely on a set of beliefs and assumptions that they\u2019ve formed about the world, and in order for growth to occur after a trauma, the traumatic event must deeply challenge those beliefs. By Tedeschi and Calhoun\u2019s account, the way that trauma shatters our worldviews, beliefs, and identities is like an earthquake\u2014even our most foundational structures of thought and belief crumble to pieces from the magnitude of the impact. We are shaken, almost literally, from our ordinary perception, and left to rebuild ourselves and our worlds. The more we are shaken, the more we must let go of our former selves and assumptions, and begin again from the ground up. Advertisement \u201cA psychologically seismic event can severely shake, threaten, or reduce to rubble many of the schematic structures that have guided understanding, decision making, and meaningfulness,\u201d they write. The physical rebuilding of a city that takes place after an earthquake can be likened to the cognitive processing and restructuring that an individual experiences in the wake of a trauma. Once the most foundational structures of the self have been shaken, we are in a position to pursue new\u2014and perhaps creative\u2014opportunities. Advertisement The \u201crebuilding\u201d process looks something like this: After a traumatic event, such as a serious illness or loss of a loved one, individuals intensely process the event\u2014they\u2019re constantly thinking about what happened, and usually with strong emotional reactions. It\u2019s important to note that sadness, grief, anger, and anxiety, of course, are common responses to trauma, and growth generally occurs alongside these challenging emotions\u2014not in place of them. The process of growth can be seen as a way to adapt to extremely adverse circumstances and to gain an understanding of both the trauma and its negative psychological impact. Rebuilding can be an incredibly challenging process. The work of growth requires detaching from and releasing deep-seated goals, identities, and assumptions, while also building up new goals, schemas, and meanings. It can be grueling, excruciating, and exhausting. But it can open the door to a new life. The trauma survivor begins to see herself as a thriver and revises her self-definition to accommodate her new strength and wisdom. She may reconstruct herself in a way that feels more authentic and true to her inner self and to her own unique path in life. Advertisement Creative Growth Out of loss, there can be creative gain. Of course, it's important to note that trauma is neither necessary nor sufficient for creativity. Experiences of trauma in any form are tragic and psychologically devastating, no matter what type of creative growth occurs in their aftermath. These experiences can just as easily lead to long-term loss as gain. Indeed, loss and gain, suffering and growth, often co\u2011occur. Because adverse events force us to reexamine our beliefs and priorities, they can help us break out of habitual ways of thinking and thereby boost creativity, explains Marie Forgeard, a psychologist at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School, who has done extensive research into post-traumatic growth and creativity. \u201cWe\u2019re forced to reconsider things we took for granted, and we\u2019re forced to think about new things,\u201d says Forgeard. \u201cAdverse events can be so powerful that they force us to think about questions we never would have thought of otherwise.\u201d Advertisement Creativity can even become a sort of coping mechanism after a difficult experience. Some people might find that the experience of adversity forces them to question their basic assumptions about the world and therefore to think more creatively. Others might find that they have a new (or renewed) motivation to spend time engaged in creative activities. And others who already had a strong interest in creative work may turn to creativity as the main way of rebuilding their lives.

Earliest North American Human Footprints Found In Surprising Spot In Canada The discovery suggests the ice-age humans may have used boats to travel among islands. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Mar 30, 2018, 07:41 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Footprints from ice-age humans some 13,000 years ago have been found beneath the sands of a Canadian Island in the Pacific \u2014 the earliest prints ever discovered in North America. The 29 footprints of three different shapes and sizes, which scientists believe were from a child and two adults, were embedded in a layer of clay on Calvert Island in British Columbia. The barefoot prints indicated a variety of activity, so the humans weren\u2019t simply passing through, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. Advertisement The first North Americans are widely believed to have crossed from Siberia to Alaska via a Bering land bridge. The footprints suggest the early travelers then may have traveled south along the Pacific coast, rather than farther inland. The findings add to the \u201cgrowing body of evidence that early peoples in the Americas inhabited the coastal margin and circumnavigated the western edge of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet to move between Beringia [the land bridge] and mid-latitude North America at the end of the last ice age,\u201d the authors wrote. The prints, found during excavations from 2014 to 2016, also suggest the humans may have traveled among islands via primitive boats, though no evidence of boats has been found. Advertisement The footprints provide \u201cevidence of the seafaring people who inhabited this area during the tail end of the last major ice age,\u201d Duncan McLaren, lead author of the study and anthropologist at the Hakai Institute and University of Victoria in British Columbia, said in a statement. At the end of the ice age, from 11,000 to 14,000 years ago, the sea level was as much as 10 feet below what it is now. The footprints were likely just above the high-tide line at the time. \u201cThe footprints were impressed into a soil just above the paleo-shoreline, possibly by a group of people disembarking from watercraft and moving towards a drier central activity area,\u201d the study said. Advertisement \u201cAs this island would only have been accessible by watercraft 13,000 years ago, it implies that the people who left the footprints were seafarers who used boats to get around , gather and hunt for food, and live and explore the islands,\u201d McClaren told The New York Times. The few archeological sites discovered previously as far north were slightly earlier, from 12,700 to 11,800 years ago , according to Ars Technica. Human footprints 14,000 years old have been discovered in Argentina and Chile. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Magical Healing Power Of Caring and Hope in Psychotherapy There are three consistent research findings that should make a world of difference to therapists and to the people they treat. By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Jul 6, 2015, 02:10 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. There are three consistent research findings that should make a world of difference to therapists and to the people they treat. First, psychotherapy works at least as well as drugs for most mild to moderate problems and, all things being equal, should be used first. Second, a good relationship is much more important in promoting good outcome than the specific psychotherapy techniques that are used. Advertisement Third, there is a very high placebo response rate for all sorts of milder psychiatric and medical problems. This is partly a time effect -- people come for help at particularly bad times in there lives and are likely to improve with time even if nothing is done. But placebo response also reflects the magical power of hope and expectation. And the effect is not just psychological -- the body often actually responds to placebo just as it would responded to active medication. These three findings add up to one crucial conclusion -- the major focus of effective therapy should be to establish a powerfully healing relationship and to inspire hope. Specific techniques help when they enhance the primary focus on the relationship, they hurt when they distract from it. Advertisement The paradox is that therapists are increasingly schooled in specific techniques to the detriment of learning how to heal. The reason is clear -- it is easy to manualize technique, hard to teach great healing. I have, therefore, asked a great healer, Fanny Marell a Swedish social worker and licensed psychotherapist, to share some of her secrets. Ms Marell writes: \"Many therapists worry so much about assessing symptoms, performing techniques, and filling out forms that they miss the wonderful vibrancy of a strong therapeutic relationship. Advertisement Thinking I can help someone just by asking about concerns, troubles, and symptoms is like thinking that I can drive a car solely by looking in the rear view mirror. Dreams, hopes, and abilities are seen out of the front window of the car and help us together to navigate the road ahead. Where are we going? Which roads will you choose and why? It surely will not be the same roads I would take -- we are different -- we have to find your own best direction. If we focus only on troubles and diagnosis, we lose the advantage of capitalizing on the person's strengths and resources. If I am to help someone overcome symptoms, change behaviors, and climb out of difficult situations, I need to emphasize also all the positives he brings to the situation. Therapy without conversations about strengths and hopes is not real therapy. And often most important: Does the patient have a sense of humor? Laugh together! Be human. No one wants a perfect therapist. It is neither credible nor human. Advertisement Symptom checklists and diagnoses play a role but don't give me no understanding of how this person/patient understands his world and her troubles. And don't drown in manuals, missing the person while applying the technique. People come to me discouraged and overwhelmed -- their hopes and dreams abandoned. Early in our time together, I ask many detailed questions about how they would like life to change. What would you do during the day? Where would you live? What would your relationship to your family be like? What would you do in your spare time? How kind of social circle wood you have? By getting detailed descriptions I get concrete goals (eg I want to go to school, I want to argue less with my parents, spend more time with friends). Almost always, working with the family is useful; sometimes it is absolutely necessary. What would be a good life for your child? How would it affect you? Advertisement Sometimes are dreams are big, perhaps even too extravagant; sometimes they are small and and perhaps too cautious. But dreams always become more realistic and realizable when they are expressed. Sharing a dream and making it a treatment goal helps the person make a bigger investment in the treatment, and to take more responsibility for it. He becomes the driver and the therapist may sit in the back seat.\" Because my first conversation is not just about symptoms and troubles, we start off on a basis of realistic hope and avoid a negative spiral dominate only by troubles. Problems have to be faced, but from a position of strength, not despair and helplessness. Having a rounded view of the person's problems and strengths enriches the therapeutic contact and creates a strong alliance. Advertisement Thanks, Ms. Marell, for terrific advice. Some of the best natural therapists I have known have been ruined by psychotherapy training -- becoming so preoccupied learning and implementing technique that they lost the healing warmth of their personalities. Therapy should always be an exciting adventure -- an intense meeting of hearts and minds. You can't learn to be an effective therapist by reading a manual and applying it mechanically. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

We usually don't see this until much later.\" Michael B. Thomas via Getty Images Workers in southwestern Tennessee were preparing sandbags on Friday in hopes of limiting damage from the Mississippi when it crests at Memphis next week, state emergency management officials said. Officials were also examining levees, to make sure they would hold. Advertisement \"We're moving things up high and we've got our generators out and got some extra water,\" said Dotty Kirkendoll, a clerk at Riverside Park Marina on McKellar Lake, which feeds off the Mississippi. Flooding in the U.S. Midwest typically occurs in the spring as snowmelt swells rivers. Freezing temperatures that have followed the rare winter flooding have added to regional woes. Very unbelievable, had to share. Posted by Tracy Haussels on Friday, January 1, 2016 Advertisement Most of the deaths in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas have been caused by people driving into flooded areas after days of downpours. The dead included a central Illinois teenager whose body was recovered on Friday near where a truck in which he was riding was found the day before. Another teen from the truck was still missing. Authorities also continued searching on Friday for country singer Craig Strickland, who had gone duck hunting on an Oklahoma lake during stormy conditions. His friend, Chase Morland, was found dead on Monday. Twelve Illinois counties have been declared disaster areas, and Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday ordered Illinois National Guard troops into flooded areas in the southern part of the state to mitigate flood damage and help with evacuation efforts. Advertisement ASSOCIATED PRESS The Mississippi is expected to crest at Thebes, in southern Illinois, at 47.5 feet (14 meters) on Sunday, more than 1.5 feet above the 1995 record, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. Flood warnings were also in effect on Friday for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, the Carolinas, Alabama and Kentucky, the NWS said, while major flooding was occurring on the Arkansas River and its tributaries in that state. Advertisement Dozens have died in U.S. storms, which also brought unusual winter tornadoes and were part of a wild worldwide weather system over the Christmas holiday period that also saw severe flooding in Britain.

Mysterious 'Ripples' Zooming Away From Nearby Star Baffle Scientists The waves seen around AU Mic are \"unlike anything ever seen, or even predicted, before.\" By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Oct 12, 2015, 05:59 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Bizarre, fast-moving \"ripples\" spotted around a nearby star have scientists scratching their heads. They say the waves are \"unlike anything ever seen, or even predicted , before.\" Astronomers spotted the strange structures in the surrounding dust cloud of a young star called AU Mic while observing it with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. The scientists say five giant, wave-like arches can be seen racing away from the star like \"ripples in water.\" Advertisement Anthony Boccaletti, the lead author of a new research paper on the subject, said the finding was very \"unexpected.\" The images of AU Mic \"show a set of unexplained features,\" Boccaletti said. Using images from ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescope and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered fast-moving wave-like features in the dusty disc around the nearby star AU Microscopii. The images above show the ripples' movement over the course of four years. Credit: ESO, NASA By comparing images of the star taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2010 and 2011, Boccaletti and his team deduced that the ripples are racing away from the star at a rapid pace. Advertisement These waves are said to be moving at speeds of up to 24,855 miles per hour. \"At least three of the features are moving so fast that they could well be escaping from the gravitational attraction of the star,\" according to a news release. This chart shows the location of the nearby star AU Microscopii in the faint southern constellation of Microscopium (The Microscope). Most of the stars visible to the naked eye on a clear dark night are shown. AU Mic is too faint to be seen without a small telescope, but its position is marked with a red circle. Credit: ESO, IAU and Sky Since the discovery, researchers have been racking their brains to pinpoint the nature and origin of these strange ripples. Advertisement \"Everything about this find was pretty surprising,\" said co-author Carol Grady. \"And because nothing like this has been observed or predicted in theory, we can only hypothesize when it comes to what we are seeing and how it came about.\" The scientists say the ripples are likely not caused by the collision of two large asteroid-like objects or by instabilities in the star\u2019s gravity. One possibility is that the arches are linked to AU Mic\u2019s flares. As Business Insider notes, the star \"regularly ejects huge bursts of stellar energy from its surface , so it\u2019s possible an especially large flare was powerful enough to push the ripples of dust away from the star and out into the cosmos.\" Advertisement Scientists say the star needs to be observed further before any solid answer can be found. AU Mic is a red dwarf star that's located 32 light-years from Earth. Scientists have been observing the large disc of dust around the star for signs of possible planets. Studies of such discs \"can provide valuable clues about how planets, which form from these discs, are created,\" said the release. A paper describing the discovery was published on Oct. 7 in the journal Nature .

Cockroaches Are Even Faster, Tougher And Ickier Than We Thought Scientists are building a robot just like 'em to find disaster victims. By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Feb 9, 2016, 05:03 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Some of the cockroach's most disgusting properties are now being used for good. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have harnessed the survival skills of the icky pests into a robot prototype that could be used to find victims in an earthquake or other disaster. The cockroach bot was described in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday. But the living cockroaches who invade our kitchens are still gross. In a new video (above), the researchers put roaches to the test and discovered that they can withstand almost 900 times their own bodyweight without injury -- no wonder the little $$@@!! won't die when we step on them. Advertisement They can squeeze through one-tenth-of-an-inch crevices and skitter away at high speed, even when they're flattened in half. Advertisement At least all that indestructibility is pushing search-and-rescue technology forward. Kaushik Jayaram, lead author of the paper who conducted the research while earning his PhD at UC Berkeley, designed a palm-sized robot that is capable of collapsing like a real roach. Named CRAM, or Compressible Robot With Articulated Mechanisms, it can be equipped with a camera and a plastic shield to mimic the roach's hard-but-flexible exoskeleton. As CBS noted, CRAM looks more like an armadillo, but its properties are roach-like and may someday save lives. Advertisement \" In the event of an earthquake , first responders need to know if an area of rubble is stable and safe, but the challenge is, most robots can\u2019t get into rubble,\" Robert Full, a professor of integrative biology at UC Berkeley and co-author of the paper, said in a statement. \"But if there are lots of cracks and vents and conduits, you can imagine just throwing a swarm of these robots in to locate survivors and safe entry points for first responders.\" CRAM is in the prototype phase, but it's grudgingly raised our opinions of cockroaches. \" It\u2019s a nice lesson in humility ,\u201d Daniel Goldman , an associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research, told the Atlantic. \"These animals are not simple in any way, shape, or form\u2014and especially not in their shape or form.\" Advertisement Yeah, but they're still disgusting. Correction : A previous version of this article misstated that cockroaches can withstand 900 pounds of pressure, rather they can withstand 900 times their body weight.

Stephen Hawking: Trump's Climate Policies Could Turn Earth Into Venus \"...two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid.\" By Rebecca Shapiro Senior Editor, HuffPost Jul 3, 2017, 03:23 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT British theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking is not mincing words: President Donald Trump \u2019s decision to withdraw from the landmark Paris accord combating climate change could cause irreversible harm to the planet. In an interview with the BBC in honor of Hawking\u2019s 75th birthday, the Cambridge professor said Trump will cause \u201cavoidable environmental damage\u201d by denying climate change evidence and leaving the agreement. \u201cWe are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump\u2019s action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid.\u201d Advertisement The president announced the decision last month, arguing that the agreement was a \u201cbad deal\u201d for the U.S. As multiple experts, scientists and world leaders pointed out, the deal was nonbinding and had largely been negotiated to meet U.S. expectations. Earlier this year, Hawking, who has spoken out against Trump in the past, said the president\u2019s anti-science agenda left him feeling unwelcome in the United States. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Paleontologist Talks About Fossil \u2018Find Of A Lifetime\u2019 In Area Cut From Bears Ears \u201cI will probably spend the rest of my career working on this site,\" said paleontologist Robert Gay. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 28, 2018, 09:18 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The snout of the phytosaur Pravusuchus discovered within the original boundary of Bears Ears National Monument. Robert Gay BLANDING, Utah \u2014 In 2016, paleontologist Robert Gay and a group of students stumbled upon a trove of prehistoric fossils in southeastern Utah, in what is part of the more than 1 million acres President Donald Trump recently cut from the Bears Ears National Monument . The team had been en route to another excavation site when an outcropping of rocks from the Triassic period caught Gay\u2019s eye. They stopped to investigate and immediately began picking up fossilized chunks of bone. \u201cThe entire surface was carpeted with fossil bones,\u201d Gay, the education director at the Colorado Canyons Association, told HuffPost. \u201cEverywhere on the hillside, for 60 meters.\u201d Advertisement \u201cThis is the find of a lifetime. I will probably spend the rest of my career working on this site.\u201d - Paleontologist Robert Gay What Gay\u2019s team discovered could be the densest bed of Triassic-era fossils in the nation, and maybe the world. During an initial excavation at the site last year, he unearthed the intact skulls of three long-snouted phytosaurs, a reptile that lived more than 200 million years ago. That\u2019s nearly 120 million years before Tyrannosaurus rex showed up. During the Triassic period, which spanned 251 million to 199 million years ago, dinosaurs and a slew of other bizarre creatures roamed the Earth. There were many crocodile-like reptiles \u2014 armored plant-eaters, a two-legged species with a beak, and another with a blowhole on its head \u2014 along with \u201csalamanders the size of cars, with toilet bowl lid heads,\u201d Gay said. The period ended with a global extinction event that wiped out some 76 percent of marine and terrestrial species. And thus began the Jurassic period, the age of the dinosaurs. Advertisement Gay says he\u2019s only scratched the surface of the fossil record at this Utah site, a record he believes could prove key to understanding how dinosaurs were able to respond to rapid climatic changes and came to dominate the landscape. \u201cThis is the find of a lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cI will probably spend the rest of my career working on this site.\u201d Meet @paleorob , who discovered that trove of crocodile-like phytosaur fossils in Bears Ears. He told me it's \"the find of a lifetime.\" \"I will probably spend the rest of my career working on this site. It gives us a new, unparalleled look into the dawn of the age of dinosaurs.\" pic.twitter.com/N5CvvF29Le \u2014 Chris D'Angelo (@c_m_dangelo) March 27, 2018 Advertisement HuffPost talked to Gay this week at the first of two public scoping meetings the federal government held to receive input on managing what remains of Bears Ears National Monument. Trump\u2019s December announcement cut Bears Ears by 85 percent , to just over 200,000 acres, opening the door for new mining, drilling and other development on lands now left outside of the monument. Gay still has a permit to work the site, but because it is no longer part of a national monument, he and his team are unable to use the $25,000 grant they received through a special Bureau of Land Management program that funds research on conservation lands. Gay said he can use the funds for other sites still in the monument, but not this one. Work at the site will remain stalled until the team locates another source of funding. Gay has applied for other grants and is exploring partnerships that would allow for his team to continue field work there. Advertisement The question he\u2019s looking to answer: \u201cWhy did dinosaurs come to rule the world?\u201d The latest fossil discovery is one of several important paleontological sites within the area cut from the monument. And Gay, who opposes the monument rollback, said there is much more to be discovered. Bears Ears \u201cpreserves a unique slice of American history and pre-history dating back almost to the dawn of life on land,\u201d he said.

From Space, Earth Looks Sickly And Fragile, Astronaut Says Scott Kelly, the commander of the International Space Station, returns from his mission March 1. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 13, 2016, 04:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Nearing the end of a yearlong mission in space, American astronaut Scott Kelly gave Mother Earth a diagnosis based on what he's seen from his vantage point 250 miles above the blue planet. In short, areas of the planet look sickly and its fragile atmosphere must be taken care of. Astronaut Scott Kelly poses for a selfie on the International Space Station. NASA NASA / Reuters Kelly's comments came during a recent satellite interview with CNN , in which the network's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, asked the astronaut to describe the health of the planet as if he were looking at a human body. Advertisement Certain areas, specifically parts of Asia and Central America, Kelly said, are covered in a \" haze of pollution \" and \"look kind of sick.\" This is a good example of the air pollution that exists across large parts of Asia. #YearInSpace pic.twitter.com/GdVd3GSdJ2 \u2014 Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) January 6, 2016 As for Earth's atmosphere, Kelly said he wouldn't go as far as to say it looks unhealthy. \"But it definitely looks very, very fragile, just kind of like this thin film,\" he told Gupta. \"So, it looks like something that we definitely need to take care of.\" Advertisement Day 295. #Earth .

Science Confirms That Men Are The More Narcissistic Sex Science Confirms That Men Are The More Narcissistic Sex By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 6, 2015, 03:44 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Man taking selfie in front of car It turns out there's a reason your male boss is so obsessed with himself: Society hardwired him to act that way. In a provocative new study published in the March issue of the journal Psychological Bulletin , psychologists at the University at Buffalo showed that men outscore women in just about every measure of narcissism. Advertisement The researchers , who analyzed 31 years' worth of personality test results from 475,000 people, found that while men and women are equally vain, men across generations tend to be more narcissistic in every other way, including having inflated self-esteem and a greater sense of entitlement. This is likely related to gendered social norms, said Emily Grijalva, an assistant professor of organization and human resources at the university and the study's lead author. \"Although entitlement is undesirable for both genders... women will be penalized more harshly for acting entitled than men because entitlement is inconsistent with stereotypes that tend to emphasize women being caring and nurturing,\" she told The Huffington Post. Advertisement While narcissism can be healthy in moderation -- Grijalva noted that narcissists often make good first impressions, have good self-esteem and are identified as leaders -- being overly concerned with one's appearance or reputation can have significant downsides. \"They can also be exploitative, entitled, lack empathy for others, and have trouble maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships,\" she said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The researchers looked at three facets of narcissism: leadership, assertiveness and desire for power; confidence, inflated self-esteem and exhibitionism; and a sense of entitlement. Advertisement Men tended to show greater assertiveness and desire for power than women, and showed a particularly elevated sense of entitlement. That suggests that men might be more likely to feel that they deserve special privileges and may be more likely to exploit others for their own ends, the study said.

Stephen Hawking's Final Resting Place Is Among Some Of The Greatest Scientists In History Interment inside Westminster Abbey is a rarely bestowed honor. Reuters Mar 21, 2018, 02:39 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING LONDON (Reuters) - British physicist Stephen Hawking is to take his place among some of the greatest scientists in history when his ashes are interred inside Westminster Abbey, close to the graves of Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin. Hawking, the world\u2019s most recognizable scientist, died last week aged 76 after a lifetime spent probing the origins of the universe, the mysteries of black holes and the nature of time itself. Advertisement Stephen Hawking will be interred at Westminster Abbey, the final resting place of 17 monarchs and of some of the most significant figures in British history. Lucas Jackson / Reuters Ravaged by the wasting motor neurone disease he developed at 21, Hawking was confined to a wheelchair for most of his life. As his condition worsened, he had to speak through a voice synthesizer and communicate by moving his eyebrows. Westminster Abbey, the final resting place of 17 monarchs and of some of the most significant figures in British history, said on Tuesday it would hold a Service of Thanksgiving for Hawking later this year, during which his ashes would be interred. Advertisement \u201cIt is entirely fitting that the remains of Professor Stephen Hawking are to be buried in the Abbey, near those of distinguished fellow scientists,\u201d said the Dean of Westminster, John Hall, in a statement. Newton, who formulated the law of universal gravitation and laid the foundations of modern mathematics, was buried in the abbey in 1727. Darwin, whose theory of evolution was one of the most far-reaching scientific breakthroughs of all time, was buried close to Newton in 1882. Advertisement Interment inside Westminster Abbey is a rarely bestowed honor. The most recent burials of scientists there were those of Ernest Rutherford, a pioneer of nuclear physics, in 1937, and of Joseph John Thomson, who discovered electrons, in 1940. Hawking\u2019s death last week was met with tributes from around the world.

Climate Change Will Ruin Wine Eventually, So You May As Well Drink It All Now Global warming is terrorizing our terroir. By Jenna Amatulli Reporter, HuffPost Mar 23, 2016, 02:16 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING We'll stop whining about climate change when it stops affecting our wine. The warming climate is helping vineyards produce better wine. However, producers in Western Europe and beyond may have to move their production elsewhere if they want to stay in business for the long run -- and that includes France, new evidence suggests . Droughts are the reason for this shake-up. Advertisement In France and Switzerland , the greatest wines are produced when hot summers and end-of-season droughts follow heavy spring rains. This speeds up the harvest and makes for a better wine. Droughts are crucial in great wine. Indian summers reduce surface moisture, dry the soil and bring on the harvest. Climate change is pushing harvests further back. \u201cNow, it\u2019s become so warm thanks to climate change, grape growers don\u2019t need drought to get these very warm temperatures,\u201d said Benjamin Cook , a climate scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies . Advertisement While global warming is currently improving wine, it spells upheaval and disaster in the long term. For now, the heat has brought out some \u201c grands millesimes ,\u201d a French term for great vintages, according to Discovery . \u201cSo far, a good year is a hot year,\u201d said study co-author Elizabeth Wolkovich , an ecologist at Harvard University. \"If we keep pushing the heat up, vineyards can\u2019t maintain that forever.\u201d The study notes a change in harvest in 1980 that advanced two weeks over the 400-year mean in France, where producers have kept records for centuries. Advertisement For every degree Centigrade (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) that the Earth warms, grape harvests advance forward roughly six or seven days. For reference, France has warmed about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) during the 20 century, and that's surely only the start. The shift isn't sustainable because of the consequences to wine-growing and quality of the product. With so much heat, harvest timing has been virtually disconnected from moisture which could mean trouble down the line. Advertisement The Columbia study examines where certain vineyards could end up moving. California\u2019s Napa Valley grapes could theoretically end up in Washington or British Columbia. The hills of central China could become the new Chile . There's no guarantee that moving the vineyards is a safe bet. New environments mean new problems, so it's not certain if the transplanted ecosystems could survive rapid changes. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Is Most Of Our DNA Garbage? Is Most Of Our DNA Garbage? By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 7, 2015, 08:37 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Genetic research. Conceptual, composite image of a hand holding a DNA molecule. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is composed of two strands twisted into a double helix. This contains sections called genes that encode the body's genetic information. Genes determine each cell's structure, function and behaviour. T. Ryan Gregory\u2019s lab at the University of Guelph in Ontario is a sort of genomic menagerie, stocked with creatures, living and dead, waiting to have their DNA laid bare. Scorpions lurk in their terrariums. Tarantulas doze under bowls. Flash-frozen spiders and crustaceans \u2014 collected by Gregory, an evolutionary biologist, and his students on expeditions to the Arctic \u2014 lie piled in beige metal tanks of liquid nitrogen. A bank of standing freezers holds samples of mollusks, moths and beetles. The cabinets are crammed with slides splashed with the fuchsia-stained genomes of fruit bats, Siamese fighting fish and ostriches. Gregory\u2019s investigations into all these genomes has taught him a big lesson about life: At its most fundamental level, it\u2019s a mess.

Changing and Unchanging Cycles Since we arbitrarily impose a beginning and an end on our equitable distribution of days, let's reflect on some of the cycles that dominate our existence: the big ones over which we have no control, the smaller ones we might hope to influence, and those about which we don't yet know. By Lisa Randall, Contributor Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, 'Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe' Physics Professor, Harvard University; Author, 'Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe' Jan 1, 2016, 11:36 AM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

(GERMANY OUT) Spaceflight United States of America, Moon landing of Apollo 11 in 1969: View from lunar module 'Eagle': earthrise sequence - earth rises over lunar horizon - July 20, 1969 (Photo by NASA/ullstein bild via Getty Images) On New Year's Eve, as we hum \"Auld Lang Syne\" and drink a cup of kindness, we celebrate the end of one year and the beginning of another. It might feel like a big deal to us here on earth, but from an astronomical perspective, it's just a day like any other -- as one planet circles one star, the sun, out of the galaxy's billions. But since we arbitrarily impose a beginning and an end on our equitable distribution of days, let's reflect on some of the cycles that dominate our existence: the big ones over which we have no control, the smaller ones we might hope to influence, and those about which we don't yet know. This way, we can make some resolutions that will outlast the echoes of our song. Patterns and repetition are comforting because they help us remember and understand events. Phenomena that occur on a regular basis generally have an underlying reason. The cosmos provides us with numerous examples. Isaac Newton deduced the law of gravity that allows us to predict elliptical orbits around a central object's gravitational pull. This is how the Milky Way attracts the sun, which takes roughly 240 million years to orbit the galaxy's center. And as we all know, the earth, along with all the other planets in our solar system, orbits the sun. The earth's cycle takes a year -- hence the holiday and festivities before us. Advertisement The planets in the solar system are joined by objects with lesser celebrity status, such as asteroids and comets. Dwarf planets orbit too. \"Dwarf planet'' is a new category that includes the demoted Pluto, but also other objects of similar size that have been discovered since the 1990s -- objects that are big enough to take notice of (and are spherical) but not quite big enough to orbit alone. Like John Mayer, who formerly headlined on his own but now tours with the Grateful Dead, Pluto is no longer a solo act. The earth's rotation on its axis, creating the 24-hour cycle we know so well, is why Annie who gets her gun (back when that could be considered amusing) has the sun in the morning and the moon at night. It's also why orphan Annie knows the sun will come out tomorrow. (The moon rotates too -- but at a rate commensurate with that of its orbit. This results in a side of the moon we never see, sometimes colloquially, and inaccurately, called \"the dark side of the moon.\" Being invisible to us does not make it dark -- the sun still shines on this hidden hemisphere.) Seasons result from the tilt of the earth's axis of rotation, which makes regions subject to differing amounts of the sun's radiation as the earth orbits around it. Long-term climate trends depend on other cyclical patterns too, such as the various Milankovitch cycles of thousands of years, named for the Serbian astronomer-mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who realized that the periodic changes in the earth's ellipticity -- how far from circular the orbit is -- as well as changes in the earth's tilt, can result in climate changes that lead, about every 100,000 years, to ice ages and to shorter periodic weather patterns, too. However, these many-thousand-year cycles don't explain what is happening on time scales determined by human activity in the last few hundred years. Advertisement Within the earth, too, patterns repeat themselves. Over a few hundred million years of geological activity, the plates of the earth are regenerated, and, over a shorter time scale, the ocean floor is reconfigured too. Movements of the continental plates are one of the drivers of another important cycle, the carbon cycle, so essential to life on our planet. The cycle of carbon in the atmosphere -- critical to our climate, and to life itself -- results in part from carbon that is released into the atmosphere through volcanoes and hotspots and is absorbed back into the earth. There is weak evidence that large-impact craters on earth -- those that arose from a kilometer-wide asteroid or comet hitting the earth -- also happen periodically. Research by my collaborators and me suggests that it could be the gravitational pull of dark matter in the midplane of the Milky Way that dislodges weakly bound comets at the edge of the solar system so that they are more likely to hit the earth in a 32-million-year cycle. Measurements being done currently will show whether such a dark matter disc exists. Though we are safe from any such hypothesized cataclysmic impact for another 30 million years, there are other cycles, ones over which we can exercise some control, that present much more immediate threats. We are repeatedly alerted to melting glaciers and increasingly dangerous storms. News about the Middle East changes in detail, but the general patterns remain the same. Gun shootings in America happen so regularly that the cycles of outrage and pushback are barely noticeable. Advertisement Yet despite the recurring carousel of time, we enter each new year with optimism. It will be easier to maintain that belief in a better future if we think a little harder about how and when we can eject ourselves from undesirable patterns. The Paris climate agreement and its ancillary benefits can help us begin to make real progress in slowing down changes to the earth's climate, a cycle we have only a limited time to affect. Maybe we can curb, or at least slow down, other seeming inevitabilities, too. In the universe, cycles won't last forever as the solar system and the galaxy undergo changes. If we can keep in mind that humanity has the potential to change the cycles that we impose on ourselves, then maybe this new year we'll break that most reliable cycle of all -- making resolutions we don't have the fortitude to keep.

Smartphone Lovers More Likely To Forget Things, Walk Into People Stop reading this and go outside! By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 20, 2015, 04:13 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Mimi Haddon/Getty Images Did you forget your wallet at home today? Miss an appointment? Bump into someone on the street? If you answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, there's a good chance that you're spending a little too much time staring at your iPhone. New research from psychologists at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, finds that frequent users of mobile technology and the Internet are more likely to experience these types of \"cognitive failures,\" which arise from forgetfulness, inattention and a lack of awareness of one's surroundings. Advertisement \"I was very surprised that both problematic mobile phone use and internet addiction was so strongly correlated to... cognitive failures,\" Dr. Lee Hadlington, a psychologist at the university and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"It really was an eye-opener.\" For the study, the researchers recruited 210 British mobile phone users between the ages of 18 and 65. The average weekly Internet use among the participants was about 23 hours. The participants answered questions about the amount of time they spent using the Internet and mobile devices, and about their behaviors related to perception, motor function and memory. The results revealed a significant correlation between the amount of time a person spends using the Internet or their mobile phone and their likelihood of experiencing cognitive failures in their daily lives, including memory errors, physical blunders and daydreaming while others are talking. Women in the study tended to experienced more cognitive failures than men. Advertisement It's not clear whether smartphones are actually causing attentional lapses. It might be the other way around, with people who already have attentional difficulties being more likely to use technology excessively. Or it might be a combination of both, creating a feedback loop. Or, of course, maybe neither thing is causing the other. Hadlington, however, is convinced that our phones are affecting us more than we'd like. \"Aspects of mobile technology are creating a situation where many individuals, who may be prone to distraction and lack of focus, find the lure of technology too hard to resist,\" he told HuffPost. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Advertisement \"The Internet is great, mobile phones are great, but there is a point at which we need to sit back, log off and really start to think about how technology is impacting on our capacity to focus,\" Hadlington wrote. \"We are always eager to get the new piece of tech -- but not to think about its underlying consequences to our cognitive capabilities.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Bob Ebeling, Challenger Engineer Who Forewarned Of Shuttle Disaster, Dead At 89 Ebeling, who blamed himself for 30 years, found peace in the last weeks of his life. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 22, 2016, 01:14 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT For three decades, retired NASA engineer Bob Ebeling blamed himself for being unable to stop the 1986 launch of space shuttle Challenger. He had warned that the shuttle might explode, and it did shortly after liftoff, killing seven crew members. In the final weeks of his life, however, thanks to an outpouring of support following a National Public Radio story in January on the 30th anniversary of the disaster, Ebeling, 89, finally found peace . \" It was as if he got permission from the world ,\" Ebeling's daughter, Leslie Ebeling Serna, told NPR on Monday. \"He was able to let that part of his life go.\" Advertisement Ebeling died Monday in his home in Brigham City, Utah, after a prolonged illness with prostate cancer , NPR reported. Challenger Engineer Who Warned Of Shuttle Disaster Dies https://t.co/ww6ibIcfYz \u2014 NPR (@NPR) March 22, 2016 Ebeling was one of five engineers at a NASA contractor then called Morton Thiokol who warned the space agency that cold temperatures predicted at the time of the launch could prove disastrous. The warning was ignored. Advertisement The night before the launch, Ebeling reportedly told his wife, Darlene, \" It's going to blow up .\" He told another daughter, Kathy Ebeling , that he had toyed with the idea of bringing his hunting rifle to work to threaten NASA not to launch, according to an article last month in The Washington Post. The next day, Ebeling watched in horror as the shuttle disintegrated over the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds after liftoff. He quit his job soon after that. And for the rest of his life, he carried guilt for not having done more. \"I think that was one of the mistakes that God made,\" Ebeling told NPR in January. \"He shouldn't have picked me for the job. But next time I talk to him, I'm gonna ask him, 'Why me? You picked a loser .'\" Advertisement North Carolina resident Jim Sides was one of the hundreds of people who reached out after hearing Ebeling's story. \" God didn't pick a loser ,\" Sides told NPR. \"He picked Bob Ebeling.\" With support from people around the country, Ebeling finally put his feelings of failure aside, his family members said. Advertisement \" Thank you ,\" Ebeling told NPR last month, when asked if he had anything to say to those who wrote him letters. \"You helped bring my worrisome mind to ease. You have to have an end to everything.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Pilot Of Solar Plane Shares Secrets Of Record-Setting Flight Solar Plane Pilot Shares Secrets Of Record-Setting Flight By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 4, 2015, 10:44 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT DUBENDORF, SWITZERLAND - NOVEMBER 19: Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Borschberg, CEO of Solar Impulse poses during the preparation of the Solar Impulse airplane HB-SIA for a first runway test on November 19, 2009 in Dubendorf, Switzerland. Piccard, psychatrist and aeronaut, who made the first non-stop round-the-world balloon flight, and CEO and former fighter pilot Borschberg plan a round-the-world flight, driven only by solar energy, for 2012. (Photo by Johannes Simon/Getty Images) Swiss pilot Andr\u00e9 Borschberg still has a long flight ahead. He took off Sunday afternoon from Nagoya, Japan, in the Solar Impulse 2, an experimental craft powered only by sunlight that is attempting to set a record as the first plane of its kind to circumnavigate the globe. After several weather delays, Borschberg is finally en route to Hawaii, on the most difficult leg of the expedition, dubbed the \u201cEarhart Leg\u201d because it is roughly the same path on which Amelia Earhart disappeared 77 years ago. Borschberg is expected in Honolulu by Friday or Saturday. Advertisement We spoke with Borschberg via satellite uplink from his cramped cabin in the Solar Impulse 2.

Dazzling Video Shows What The Night Sky Would Look Like If You Could See Every Asteroid Dazzling Interactive Video Shows What HumansSee From Earth By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Jul 4, 2015, 10:51 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT If you think asteroids are rare, it's only because they're so small and dark and hard to see. An eye-opening new video (above) shows what the night sky would look like if we could see the near-Earth asteroids astronomers have discovered -- it's quite a swarm. \"We're essentially flying around the sun through this population of asteroids with our eyes closed,\" Scott Manley, the astronomer who created the animation and posted it to YouTube, says in the video. Advertisement The interactive video lets you pan around the night sky as if you were standing in the darkness with a powerful telescope. Manley created it to spotlight the all-too-real danger that asteroids pose to humanity . Thinking about the threat isn't much fun, but we have to say that watching the video is. Enjoy!

What Lab-Grown Human Hearts Could Mean For The Donor Crisis Scientists have successfully used stem cells to generate human heart muscle. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 23, 2016, 03:48 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A partially \"recellularized\" human whole-heart cardiac scaffold, being cultured in a bioreactor. Bernhard Jank, MD, Ott Lab, Center for Regenerative Medicine, MassGeneral Hospital Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston have taken a big first step toward growing human hearts in a lab, which could possibly put an end to the national organ donation crisis. The scientists stripped donor hearts of any cells that might cause recipients to reject them and then used stem cells to rebuild the tissue . Advertisement A study detailing the process sheds light on several key elements of bioengineering human heart muscle, said Dr. Harald C. Ott. He is an assistant professor in surgery at the hospital and a senior author of the study, which was published in the journal Circulation Research in the fall. \"While limited in force, these were the first (tiny) beats of a newly formed, human stem cell derived heart,\" Ott wrote last week in an email to The Huffington Post. Scientists still have a ways to go until they can bioengineer whole functional hearts for patients, he added. Ideally, however, they one day might be able to grow an entire organ using the donee's own cells and tissue. Advertisement \"As with many developments, time is a factor determined by funding, man and brain power,\" Ott said. \"Our study shows that it is in theory possible, but much work remains to be done. As a first step, I do believe that parts of human hearts will become available sooner than whole heart grafts, and we are actively pursuing this option.\" Having that option would be life-saving, as there are 4,153 people across the U.S. who need a heart transplant -- and last year, about 402 people died while on the waiting list for one, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing . \u201cSometime in the future we will be able to grow hearts, or at least heart tissue to offset the bottleneck.\"\u201d - Biologist Dr. Young-sup Yoon Advertisement The study involved 73 human hearts that had been donated through the New England Organ Bank. They weren't suitable for transplantation but could be used for research purposes. The scientists used a detergent solution to strip away the hearts' incompatible cells, leaving behind cardiac \"scaffolds.\" Next, they turned adult skin cells into pluripotent stem cells , which can be transformed into any other cell found in the human body. The researchers induced the pluripotent cells to become cardiac muscle cells and then repopulated the remaining \"scaffolds\" with the new cells. They mounted the hearts in an automated bioreactor system (see photo above) that added nutrients to the organs and applied certain stressors to them -- conditions similar to those experienced by a real, living heart. After 14 days, the hearts resembled normal, immature organs and even responded to electrical stimulation. Advertisement Dr. Jacques Guyette, a postdoctoral research fellow at the hospital and lead author of the study, said in a statement that the researchers are planning to improve their methods even more. \"Regenerating a whole heart is most certainly a long-term goal that is several years away, so we are currently working on engineering a functional myocardial patch that could replace cardiac tissue damaged due [to] a heart attack or heart failure,\" he said. This technique is one of several being studied in hopes of someday providing patients with transplants that won't be rejected , Fast Company reported. It also validates the feasibility of using human pluripotent stem cells in the future, said Dr. Young-sup Yoon, director of stem cell biology at the Emory University School of Medicine. Advertisement \"Most definitely, sometime in the future we will be able to grow hearts, or at least heart tissue to offset the bottleneck,\" Yoon, who was not involved in the study, told HuffPost. \"This study certainly provides a direction which may lead to such a future. ... From this, we can identify that developing newer biomaterials would greatly enhance the viability of the approach, and needs further investigation.\" Related Coverage: How 3D Printing Could End The Deadly Shortage Of Donor Organs Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Outer Space Is Coming To Postage Stamps Near You Pluto, the moon and Star Trek will be featured in 2016 stamp collections. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 31, 2015, 08:06 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Space buffs will have a lot to look forward to when it's time to send snail mail in 2016. The U.S. Postal Service has unveiled a number of postage stamps for the new year that include not only planets in our solar system and the moon, but also tributes to Pluto and NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, which made its closest approach to the dwarf planet in July . \"U.S. Postal stamps express the enthusiasm and personality of senders to favorite themes in our society,\" said John Grunsfeld, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for science in Washington. \"From Mercury to Neptune, Pluto and Star Trek, it\u2019s exciting to see that planetary science and space exploration are being celebrated in these new 2016 stamps.\" Below, feast your eyes on 2016's space-themed stamps. Pluto -- Explored! USPS/Antonio Alcala \u00a9 2016 USPS In 2006, NASA placed a 29-cent 1991 \"Pluto: Not Yet Explored\" stamp in the New Horizons spacecraft. In 2015 the spacecraft carried the stamp on its history-making mission to Pluto and beyond. \u201cThe New Horizons project is proud to have such an important honor from the U.S. Postal Service,\u201d said Alan Stern, New Horizons lead scientist from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cSince the early 1990s the old, \u2018Pluto Not Yet Explored\u2019 stamp served as a rallying cry for many who wanted to mount this historic mission of space exploration. Now that NASA\u2019s New Horizons has accomplished that goal, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling to see these new stamps join others commemorating first explorations of the planets.\u201d The souvenir sheet of four stamps contains two new stamps appearing twice. The first stamp shows an artists\u2019 rendering of the New Horizons spacecraft and the second shows the spacecraft\u2019s image of Pluto taken near its closest approach. Views of Our Planets USPS/Antonio Alcala \u00a9 2016 USPS With this pane of 16 Forever stamps, the Postal Service showcases some of the more visually compelling full-disk images of the planets obtained during this era. Eight new colorful Forever stamps, each shown twice, feature Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Some show the planets\u2019 \u201ctrue color\u201d -- what we might see if traveling through space. Others use colors to represent and visualize certain features of a planet based in imaging data. Still others use the near-infrared spectrum to show things that cannot be seen by the human eye. The Moon USPS/Greg Breeding under the art direction of William Gicker \u00a9 2016 USPS Taken as the full moon rises, the image captures the brilliant surface of Earth\u2019s only natural satellite . A full moon occurs approximately every 29.5 days when the moon is opposite the sun, with the Earth between the two. Since the rotation and orbit periods of the moon are the same, the same part of the moon is always seen from Earth. Advertisement Star Trek USPS/Heads of State under the art direction of Antonio Alcala \u00a9 2016 USPS Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the television premiere, the new \"Star Trek\" Forever stamps showcase four digital illustrations inspired by classic elements of the television program: the Starship Enterprise inside the outline of a Starfleet insignia against a gold background; he silhouette of a crewman in a transporter against a red background; the silhouette of the Enterprise from above, against a green background; and the Enterprise inside the outline of the Vulcan salute against a blue background. The words \u201cSPACE \u2026 THE FINAL FRONTIER,\u201d from Captain Kirk\u2019s famous voice-over, appear beneath the stamps against a background of stars.

World's Oldest Wild Bird Hatches Yet Another Chick Scientists call her \"an iconic symbol of inspiration and hope.\" By Landess Kearns Senior Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Feb 12, 2016, 04:34 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING HONOLULU -- The world's oldest known wild bird just gave birth, astonishing scientists yet again. Wisdom, a Laysan Albatross, is at least 65 years old , making her the oldest known bird in the wild, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The fluffy chick emerged from its shell on Feb. 1 on Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, which is part of Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument . The remote atoll lies about 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu. Advertisement In the video below, Wisdom feeds her newborn chick, named K\u016bkini, the Hawaiian word for \"messenger.\" Wisdom Feeds K\u016bkini Celebrating the United Nations International Day of Women and Girls in Science! This post of Wisdom feeding K\u016bkini is in honor of those women who are working on Midway Atoll to assure Wisdom, along with millions of other seabirds, are protected and safe by keeping weeds at bay that consume nesting habitat and by constantly monitoring the health of wildlife and habitat.  As the United Nations is hosting the first International Day of Women in Science #STEM  Kaipo Kiaha captured the work of 9 women (mostly volunteers) that goes on behind the camera guided by Wildlife Biologist Meg Duhr-Schultz. Their work allows us to share Wisdom with you. See Women in Science on Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at: http://bit.ly/WomeninScienceonMidway   Join us in helping celebrate February 11 by posting pictures of women and girls in science at #dayofwomeninscienc Posted by Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument on Thursday, February 11, 2016 This birth is far from Wisdom's first rodeo. She's hatched as many as 40 chicks in her lifetime, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. She was first banded in 1956 , and since then has continued to amaze scientists by beating the odds in an increasingly harsh ocean ecosystem. Advertisement As the oceans continue to fill up with plastic debris , seabirds like Wisdom are at great risk for consuming garbage and feeding it to their chicks. The typical lifespan of a Laysan Albatross is 12-40 years , so scientists consider Wisdom to be a very special bird. Her record-breaking longevity gives them cause to be optimistic for the ocean's health. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Oct 11, 2015, 05:13 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A blue-eyed frog. A snake with jewel-like skin. A cute little monkey that just can't seem to stop sneezing.
