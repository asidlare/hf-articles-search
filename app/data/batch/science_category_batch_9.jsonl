Security Camera Films Meteor Streaking Across Ohio Sky The spectacular display was seen from as far away as Wisconsin, Missouri and Michigan. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Nov 22, 2015, 10:02 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT It was the free firework display of the year. A meteor streaked across the Ohio night sky on Thursday -- and the spectacular sight was caught on surveillance camera. Footage filmed by Steve Hart's security cam in Anderson Township in Cincinnati at 10:47 p.m. shows the space debris suddenly appearing and growing massively in size. Advertisement It shrinks as it plummets to Earth, before moving towards the horizon. The video then cuts out. Hart didn't actually see the astonishing display in person, but revealed on Facebook that he was \"astounded\" when his son first spotted the footage on his DVR. \"This camera records movement and stores it up to six days, and when I saw this, I pulled it off of the DVR and saved it to my computer,\" he told WCPO . \"I wish I would have been outside to see it!\u201d he added. Some 77 people have reported seeing the same fireball to the American Meteor Society, according to the organization's website. Advertisement It was spotted across the Ohio area, with other sightings coming from as far away as Missouri, Kentucky, Wisconsin and Michigan. Cincinnati Observatory's Dean Regas, who saw the meteor from his backyard, told WLWT it was \"one of the brightest I have ever seen.\" Advertisement Anyone see that bright #fireball at 10:45 pm tonight? It looked like a blue meteor streaking below the Moon. \u2014 Dean Regas (@DeanRegas) November 20, 2015 So far in 2015, some 472 different fireballs -- counting those seen by at least five people or more -- have been spotted in the U.S., according to the AMS. This latest fireball came the night after what had been expected to be the peak of the annual mid-November Leonid meteor shower. Advertisement The shower is made up of tiny sand-sized bits of debris and dust that crumble off the Tempel-Tuttle comet as it passes the Earth. The particles ignite when they hit our atmosphere, and usually put on quite a show. This year's Leonid shower -- which was predicted to peak in the early hours of Tuesday and Wednesday morning -- was quieter than usual, however, with only an estimated 15 meteors streaking across the sky per hour, according to ABC News. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Apes May Be Much Closer To Human Speech Than We Realized Scientists studying Koko the gorilla witnessed a range of remarkable vocal behaviors. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 15, 2015, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Getty Images Koko has been called the \"world's most intelligent gorilla.\" The beloved 44-year-old western lowland gorilla uses over 1,000 signs from American Sign Language to communicate, and has gained a sophisticated understanding of spoken English through the help of a team of psychologists and researchers who have spent decades training her. Now, a new study is suggesting that the brainy ape may be closer to verbal communication than we've thought. Published last month in the journal Animal Cognition , the research finds that gorillas may be capable of complex vocal behavior that defies previous beliefs about their communicative abilities. Advertisement \"Traditionally, many scientists thought that apes had extremely limited vocal abilities,\" wrote cognitive scientist Marcus Perlman, a postdoctoral researcher at University of Wisconsin-Madison and the study's lead author, in an email to The Huffington Post. \"It was thought that they were not able to voluntarily control their vocalizations, and also that they were not able to to learn new vocalizations outside of their species-typical repertoire.\" The analysis of Koko's vocal behaviors suggests that humans are not the only animals to have developed an ability for spoken language. Koko Speaks Perlman and his colleagues began observing Koko to study gorilla hand gestures, but their research took a different turn after they became fascinated by the array of vocal behaviors she displayed. Advertisement The researchers analyzed 71 hours of video showing Koko interacting with the scientists who have trained her, discovering that she used nine different learned behaviors that required some degree of control over her vocal activity and breathing. These behaviors included blowing a raspberry (which Koko did when she wanted a treat), playing wind instruments, mimicking a conversation by jabbering into a fake telephone, coughing on demand and blowing her nose. In the video below, you can watch Koko play a recorder. Advertisement Koko's behavior was voluntary, and appears to be the result of living with humans throughout her life. This was surprising, since scientists had generally believed apes were incapable of controlling their vocalizations or their breathing. Documented gorilla vocalizations were limited to a set of calls related to relaying information about the environment (such as the presence of food or predators) or the apes' emotional states. While Koko's behavior clearly transcends these simple calls, that doesn't mean that other gorillas aren't also capable of what she's achieved. Advertisement \"Presumably, she is no more gifted than other gorillas,\" Perlman said in a statement . \"The difference is just her environmental circumstances. You obviously don't see things like this in wild populations.\" The Beginning Of Language The findings have some fascinating implications for our understanding of the evolution of language. Most theories of language evolution have held that spoken language is unique to humans, developing as the human line evolved after splitting off from chimpanzees roughly 7 million years ago . But the whole picture may be more complicated than that, and it's distinctly possible that the seeds of spoken language go much further back than we've thought. The foundation for human speech may have been in place at least 10 million years ago, the time of our last common ancestor with gorillas, according to researchers. So, will Koko and her gorilla friends ever learn to \"speak\" with each other? It's unlikely, except possibly in the very distant evolutionary future. \"The groundwork is there for apes to learn new communicative behaviors ... and they appear to have some ability to transmit these behaviors through social learning and even transmit the behaviors across generations,\" Perlman said. \"Perhaps this capacity evolved over millions of years into the human ability to speak.\" Advertisement Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Mesmerizing NASA Animation Shows Our Planet's Yearly Plant Cycle Scientists are hoping to better understand how plants absorb carbon on a global scale. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Nov 21, 2015, 11:45 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The yearly cycle of Earth's ecosystem is simply beautiful. As the seasons change throughout a year, the density of plant growth on land and in oceans fluctuates. NASA scientists recently imaged that yearly cycle in a stunning new animation . Advertisement The animation does not showcase a specific year of the annual plant life cycle, rather it shows an average yearly cycle based on an accumulation of satellite data and images, including data sets of the average over years and a \"running average\" over a certain number of days. The scientists hope to use the data to better understand how our planet's oceans and plant life absorb carbon dioxide emissions -- after all, they take in about half of the carbon that humans emit, according to a video (above) that the space agency released on Nov. 12. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

ISS Astronaut Shares Another Dazzling Northern Lights Video His twitter is a goldmine for space lovers! By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 17, 2015, 04:35 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Day 141. The chapter of a day ends as it began. #Aurora on a sunrise. Good night from @space_station ! #YearInSpace https://t.co/hZBMs9q0CS \u2014 Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) August 15, 2015 If you think the Northern Lights look beautiful from Earth, take a look at this dazzling new video (above) from Scott Kelly. The NASA astronaut shot the video of a shimmering aurora borealis from his perch aboard the International Space Station -- and then shared it on his Twitter account on Saturday. Advertisement Kelly, who is almost five months into his one-year mission aboard the International Space Station , shared another video of aurora borealis from space in June. He has also shared stills of auroras, including the dramatic photo (below) that he posted a couple of hours before the latest video. (Story continues below.) Another pass through #Aurora .

If You Like To Blow S*** Up, Check Out These Chemistry GIFs Blammo! By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Sep 28, 2015, 02:38 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Chemistry can be a blast--literally. Just consider what happens when you seal dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) in a bottle and submerge it in hot water. Via a process known as sublimation , the dry ice turns into gaseous carbon dioxide, and before you know it, well, just have a look at the gif below and see for yourself what happens (probably best not to try this at home). Damon Dahlen/Huffington Post Blammo! And what happens if you take a stick and lightly tap a piece of filter paper that contains traces of nitrogen triiodide ? The bulky iodine atoms rapidly separate from the nitrogen atoms to which they're bonded. It's a matter of sterics , a term chemists use to describe the ways in which the size and shape of atoms in a molecule affect molecular behavior. Advertisement \"Bulky groups of atoms tend to \u2018get in the way\u2019 of other atoms, preventing certain motions or reactions,\" Dr. Daniel Turner, assistant professor of chemistry at New York University, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"The nitrogen triiode example illustrates, in dramatic fashion, the effect of sterics on structural instability . The iodine atoms are sort of pushing each other away.\" If you'd rather see what happens than take Turner at his word, the gif below shows the violent liberation of purplish iodine (again, probably best not to try this little experiment yourself). Damon Dahlen/Huffington Post Blammo again! Those demonstrations are just a couple of the fun things you can do in a chemistry lab--not that such experiments are done just for yucks. Chemistry instructors like Turner and the instructors who trained him have used these demonstrations as teaching tools, knowing that drama can help students remember important concepts. Advertisement \"I still remember most of the explosions and other demos I saw as an undergrad,\" Turner said in the email. Recently, Turner and one of his Ph.D. students, Tobias Gellen, invited The Huffington Post into his gleaming lab in a building just off New York City's Washington Square Park to demonstrate the dry ice and nitrogen triiodide whoop-de-do's--plus the so-called Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. It doesn't produce an explosion, but it does cause, well, just look at what's going on surrounding that twisted silver wire in the dish below (it's been sped up). 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Damon Dahlen/Huffington Post Advertisement Turner called the BZ reaction \"a classic example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics...It demonstrates oscillatory kinetics resulting from nonlinear dynamic behavior.\" Got that? Oh well. Even if you can't understand why those oscillating rings form--or why that dry ice bomb and the nitrogen triiode blow up--chemistry really is a blast!

NASA Wants To Send Your Art And Poetry Out Of This World (Literally) Your creative expressions could exist in space for thousands of years. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Mar 17, 2016, 05:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An animation showing the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft as it approaches Bennu, en route to collecting a sample of the asteroid for a return to Earth. NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Are you a creative person who wishes your personal expressions of originality and imagination could transcend the boundaries of time and space? Well, NASA wants to help you achieve that lofty goal. Literally. In September, NASA will launch its OSIRIS-REx spacecraft on the first U.S. mission to collect samples of an asteroid and return them to Earth for study. The public is invited to submit art work about what exploration means to them, which will be saved on a computer chip and stored on the spacecraft. Advertisement \"Space exploration is an inherently creative activity,\" Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said in a statement . \"We are inviting the world to join us on this great adventure by placing their art work on the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, where it will stay in space for millennia.\" The spacecraft already carries a chip with more than 442,000 names that were submitted last year through NASA and The Planetary Society's \" Messages to Bennu \" campaign. The target asteroid, Bennu, is named for an Egyptian deity associated with the sun and the creation of Earth. That's apropos, as mission scientists hope the samples retrieved during the mission will provide important clues of how our solar system formed and evolved. Advertisement Bennu -- which measures approximately 538 yards in diameter -- passes close to Earth every six years, meaning it grazed us by about 22,000 miles in 2013. Check out the video below for a preview of the OSIRIS-REx journey to Bennu: It will take seven years for OSIRIS-REx to carry out its primary goal of bringing Bennu samples -- about 60 grams, or 2.1 ounces -- back to Earth, according to Erin Morton, part of the OSIRIS-REx mission's Office of the Principal Investigator at the University of Arizona . Advertisement \"We arrive at Bennu in 2018, spend a year surveying the asteroid, then take our sample in 2019,\" Morton told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Once the sample is safely stowed, we have to wait until the asteroid comes near enough to Earth for the spacecraft to easily return -- which ends up being a little over a year. We leave the asteroid in early 2021 and return to Earth in late 2023.\" When the mission is over, only the sample return capsule will fall back to Earth, so that the submitted art work from Earthlings will still be in space. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Ben Blanchet Jul 31, 2022, 10:06 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Debris from a colossal Chinese rocket made an uncontrolled reentry into the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean on Saturday. U.S. Space Command announced that the rocket \u2014 China\u2019s Long March 5B \u2014 reentered over the ocean around 12:45 p.m. EDT. The 23-ton rocket had launched from China\u2019s Hainan Island on July 24 to carry a new module to China\u2019s Tiangong space station, a station that remains under construction, Space.com reported . Advertisement The module made it to the space station while the booster rocket made an uncontrolled reentry, the third such time a Chinese rocket stage has uncontrollably descended to Earth, CBS News noted . The Aerospace Corporation\u2019s Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies expected about 5 to 9 metric tons of the rocket stage would \u201c survive reentry and reach the Earth\u2019s surface .\u201d China\u2019s Manned Space Agency claimed in a Weibo social media post that most of the rocket was destroyed on its trip to Earth. Advertisement Social media users captured the rocket apparently descending in the night sky over Kuching, the capital of Malaysia\u2019s Sarawak state. Video appears to show the debris flashing and burning as it makes its way toward land. Reentry looks to have been observed from Kuching in Sarawak, Malaysia.

FDA Approval Of Medical Devices Involves Shockingly Little Research A new report casts doubt on the rigor of even the agency's strictest approval processes. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 14, 2015, 06:56 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Apogee Apogee via Getty Images Are federal regulators playing fast and loose with the health of the tens of millions of Americans who rely on medical devices to see, walk and survive? That's the suggestion of a new study that finds most medical devices go to market with little evidence that they work or are safe. Advertisement Groups like Consumer Reports and the Government Accountability Office have long criticized the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approving medical devices that end up killing thousands of people a year . They've been most critical of the fact that the FDA allows 99 percent of new devices to go to market without any new clinical testing whatsoever. But a team at the Yale School of Medicine found that even the 1 percent of devices that are studied before getting FDA approval likely aren't being studied enough. This 1 percent consists of so-called \"high-risk\" devices, which are very different from any others on the market and which are implanted within the body or directly support human life. The Yale researchers found that these devices are subjected to an average of just one major study apiece before being granted FDA approval. This means that doctors are implanting devices like coronary stents, replacement hips and intraocular lenses in thousands of patients after they've been tested on groups of just a couple hundred people each. Advertisement Dr. Joseph Ross, a professor at Yale School of Medicine and one of the authors of the paper, said that this state of affairs is the result of federal legislation stipulating that the FDA can only require manufacturers to do the bare minimum amount of research to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a new medical device. \"The laws are written in a way to facilitate earlier access to therapy, because that's what most lawmakers think their constituents want,\" Ross said. \"But as a result, we don't have the data we need to make the best decisions for our patients.\" For their study, Ross and his co-authors looked at the 28 high-risk devices approved by the FDA in 2010 and 2011. They found that, on average, each device was the subject of just two studies before getting FDA approval, and that in most cases, one of the two studies was focused more on the basic mechanics of the device than on its long-term clinical effects. Advertisement As a condition of its approval, the FDA did stipulate that manufacturers would have to carry out further studies of the effects of these devices after their release. The FDA called for 33 such studies in all, among the 28 devices approved in that period -- a little more than one additional study per device. But the research team found that just six of these 33 studies have been completed so far, five years after some of the devices were released. Moreover, many of the clinical trials that have been completed failed to compare the medical device in question with any other medical device. Though none of the 28 devices have been implicated in the death of any patients, one of them -- a stent used in the treatment of brain aneurysms -- was voluntarily recalled because of a flaw that the FDA said could have been deadly . And more than 6,000 of the 150,000 patients who have been implanted with another device, DePuy's Pinnacle Complete prosthetic hip system, have sued the manufacturer , claiming that the metal-on-metal device caused pain and leached harmful metal ions into their bloodstreams. Ross said that there are no protocols in place to identify patients using any given medical device, so it's impossible to say exactly how many of a particular device are currently being used, or to monitor their impact in a rigorous way. Advertisement \"Right now, medical devices, unlike your computer, or your television, or even a box of pens you would buy -- they don't have a bar code on them,\" he said. \"So we can't track devices once they leave the manufacturer.\" This, at least, is changing. A law mandating identification numbers for all medical devices will be phased into effect starting in 2016 . But Ross warned that the 21st Century Cures Act, a major scientific research bill passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives last month and currently under consideration by the Senate, could make the FDA's already low threshold for approval of new medical devices even lower. Advertisement \"There are a lot of measures aimed at FDA deregulation in the bill,\" Ross said. \"It's minimizing their ability to impose stricter evidentiary standards prior to approval for lots of products, including medical devices.\" UPDATE: 8/18, 6:20 p.m. -- In an email to The Huffington Post Tuesday, the FDA noted that \"some FDA mandated post-approval studies are longer than the three to five year observation period in the study,\" and that \"therefore the studies may not be expected to be completed.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The agency also noted that it \"uses a variety of other data sources and methods to monitor the safety and effectiveness of marketed medical devices.\" Advertisement \"These can include medical device reports (MDRs) of adverse events and product problems, device registries, review of scientific literature, and other approaches depending on the specific device and public health need,\" the FDA said in its email.

These Mice Watched A Classic Orson Welles Film For Science The Allen Brain Observatory in Seattle is studying the rodents to decipher how vision works. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jul 15, 2016, 12:28 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Orson Welles, Charlton Heston and other men in a scene from Welles' classic 1958 film, \"Touch Of Evil.\" Archive Photos via Getty Images Orson Welles probably never thought some viewers of his masterpiece \u201cTouch of Evil\u201d would be mice. These classic film-viewing rodents belong to the Allen Brain Observatory , a new initiative launched July 13 by the Seattle-based Allen Institute for Brain Science to create a digital library of brains in action. Advertisement The Allen Institute has previously developed detailed maps of neurons and their connections in the brain. But the scientists behind the project hope that observing the real-time brain activity of movie-watching mice will give them more insight into how neurons receive and compute visual information. \u201cThis is a milestone in our quest to decode how the brain\u2019s computations give rise to perception, behavior, and consciousness,\u201d Christof Koch, a neuroscientist and the chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute, said in a statement . To get a close-up view of each animal\u2019s neurons in action, the researchers performed neurosurgery on the mice. \u201c[The mouse] gets outfitted with a little, tiny cranial window \u2014 a little porthole,\u201d Amy Bernard, a researcher at the Allen Institute, explained to Wired . Scientists removed a small piece of each mouse\u2019s skull atop the visual cortex to provide an opening for a microscope. Advertisement As the animals watched images of natural scenes and movies, including \u201cTouch of Evil,\u201d researchers recorded what each neuron responded to. One neuron, for example, fired every time the camera panned. The same neuron also fired in response to two different images of butterflies in a series of photos.

This New Technology Could Help Batteries Last Longer Than They Ever Have Before It involves incredible, super-tiny nanowires. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 23, 2016, 09:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Imagine a battery that can be recharged hundreds of thousands of times without ever corroding. A team of researchers at the University of California, Irvine, recently has invented just that using a nanowire-based battery material. This doesn't mean that we'll soon see such batteries on store shelves. The new research was intended to test nanowires and not a practical battery, research co-author Dr. Reginald Penner, chemistry professor at the university , told The Huffington Post on Friday. Advertisement The new battery technology, however, could edge us closer to possibly developing longer lasting commercial batteries for computers, smartphones, cars and spacecraft in the future. \"Scientists are interested in nanowires because they allow high power to be obtained, without reducing the total amount of energy that is stored,\" Penner said. \"But nanowires are fragile,\" he added. \"Any corrosion or dissolution of the nanowire material leads very quickly to breakage of the nanowire, and a loss of its capacity -- which is bad. Our research is important because it demonstrates that a very simple modification to a battery or capacitor may allow nanowire electrode materials to last a lot longer, up to 40 times longer in our studies.\" Advertisement For the research, published in the journal Energy Letters on Wednesday, gold nanowires were coated with a manganese dioxide shell and encased in an electrolyte made of a Plexiglas-like gel. The nanowires are each thousands of times thinner than a human hair. Mya Le Thai, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Irvine, holding the nanowire-based technology that allows lithium-ion batteries to be recharged hundreds of thousands of times. Steve Zylius / UCI Next, the researchers tested the power of the electrode up to 200,000 times over three months. They were shocked to find that, despite all of the tests, there was no loss of capacity or power and the nanowires didn't fracture. Advertisement \"We were not attempting to extend the cycle life of these electrodes -- we just were trying to prepare a solid state version of them by substituting a gel electrolyte for the liquid electrolyte,\" Penner said. Such batteries so far have been engineered to withstand only a certain number of cycles. Previous studies by other scientists have yielded nanowires that could only achieve 7,000 cycles, Discovery News reported . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The researchers concluded that the gel may plasticize the metal oxide in the battery and give it added flexibility, while also preventing any cracking -- allowing it to last longer than expected. Advertisement \"The coated electrode holds its shape much better, making it a more reliable option,\" said research lead author Mya Le Thai, a UCI doctoral candidate, in a statement . \"This research proves that a nanowire-based battery electrode can have a long lifetime and that we can make these kinds of batteries a reality.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Behold The Most Realistic Black Hole Simulation Yet Behold The Most Realistic Black Hole Simulation Yet By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 22, 2015, 08:26 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT What happens when two black holes collide? Spectacular new simulations show the swirling action like never before, and they're definitely worth a watch. Dr. Stuart Shapiro, professor of physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana\u2013Champaign, presented the simulations in Baltimore on April 13 at a meeting of the American Physical Society . Advertisement \"Our simulations of binary black holes merging in circumbinary magnetized disks of gas allow us to probe a cosmic event that astronomers believe occurs in distant active galaxies and quasars,\" Shapiro told The Huffington Post in an email. (Story continues below.) A sped-up version of one of the video simulations. (Click to see original). Using Einstein's theory. What sets these black hole simulations apart from previous examples? The researchers used a full-blown treatment of Einstein's general theory of relativity to build their 3D simulation models on supercomputers -- marking the first time such simulations were done without having to guesstimate the data, Nature reported. Einstein's equations describe the gravitational field around a black hole, and the researchers developed a mathematical model to pair the equations with equations that account for the motion of matter and magnetic fields. Advertisement \u201cAs a technical achievement, there\u2019s no doubt that this is a giant step forward,\u201d Dr. Cole Miller, a University of Maryland astronomer who was not involved in the research, told Nature. Timely simulations. The new simulations come at just the right time. Last March, astronomers provided evidence of two black holes on paths to collide . Their research -- along with the new simulations -- could shed light on how black holes get close enough to merge. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Thor's Helmet' Nebula Glows In Brilliant Neon Hues In New ESA Photo LOOK: 'Thor's Helmet' Glows In Brilliant Neon Hues By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 22, 2015, 08:23 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT If Thor's looking for his helmet, he should look to the stars. Nebula NGC 2359, or \"Thor's helmet\" -- so called for its remarkable likeness to the Norse god's winged headgear -- glows in bright neon hues in a newly released image from the European Space Agency. Check it out below, and see if you can make out the resemblance. (Story continues below images.) Intense X-rays sculpt Thor\u2019s neon-hued helmet. Image courtesy of J.A. Toala and M.A. Guerrero (IAA-CSIC), Y.-H. Chu (UIUC/ASIAA), R.A. Gruendl (UIUC), S. Mazlin, J. Harvey, D. Verschatse and R. Gilbert (SSRO-South) and ESA. Advertisement Thor's helmet is located about 15,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Canis Major. The new composite-color image combines optical observations from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile (shown in green and red) with X-ray emissions (blue) captured by the ESA\u2019s XMM-Newton space observatory in 2013. The massive star at the nebula's center, dubbed HD 56925, is known as a \" Wolf-Rayet star .\" Near the end of its life, it's shedding massive amounts of gas at speeds of up to 3.4 million mph . According to ESA, that gas can reach temperatures of tens of millions of degrees. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Do Carrots Really Help You See Better? Here's What Science Says Do Carrots Really Help You See Better? By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 1, 2015, 11:03 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Mom always said eating carrots would boost your eyesight. Was she right? Carrots are a good source of vitamin A (in the form of beta-carotene), a nutrient that's essential for healthy eyes, according to a new video from the American Chemical Society's Reactions series (above). But you can get add the vitamin A you need from peas, spinach, mangoes, and other foods--even cheese. So why are carrots often singled out? Advertisement The answer to that question dates back to World War II, when the Brits were trying hard to keep new radar technology a secret from the enemy. \"This fancy new radar system gave pilots a huge advantage,\" Chad Jones, a chemist and host of the Collapsed Wavefunction podcast, says in the video. \"To keep the advantage a secret, the British Royal Air Force started a rumor that their pilots ate lots of carrots to help them see the enemy better at night.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Yes, The Calorie Is Broken. Here's Why. Calories consumed minus calories burned: it\u2019s the simple formula for weight loss or gain. Except it often doesn\u2019t work. Cynthia Graber and Nicola Twilley \u2014 Mosaic Science Jan 29, 2016, 07:37 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT \u00a9 Catherine Losing \u201cFor me, a calorie is a unit of measurement that\u2019s a real pain in the rear.\u201d Bo Nash is 38. He lives in Arlington, Texas, where he\u2019s a technology director for a textbook publisher. And he\u2019s 5\u201910\u201d and 245 pounds \u2013 which means he is classed as obese. In an effort to lose weight, Nash uses an app to record the calories he consumes and a Fitbit band to track the energy he expends. These tools bring an apparent precision: Nash can quantify the calories in each cracker crunched and stair climbed. But when it comes to weight gain, he finds that not all calories are equal. How much weight he gains or loses seems to depend less on the total number of calories, and more on where the calories come from and how he consumes them. The unit, he says, has a \u201cnebulous quality to it\u201d. Advertisement Tara Haelle is also obese. She had her second son on St Patrick\u2019s Day in 2014, and hasn\u2019t been able to lose the 70 pounds she gained during pregnancy. Haelle is a freelance science journalist, based in Illinois. She understands the science of weight loss, but, like Nash, doesn\u2019t see it translate into practice. \u201cIt makes sense from a mathematical and scientific and even visceral level that what you put in and what you take out, measured in the discrete unit of the calorie, should balance,\u201d says Haelle. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem to work that way.\u201d Nash and Haelle are in good company: more than two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. For many of them, the cure is diet: one in three are attempting to lose weight in this way at any given moment. Yet there is ample evidence that diets rarely lead to sustained weight loss. These are expensive failures. This inability to curb the extraordinary prevalence of obesity costs the United States more than $147 billion in healthcare, as well as $4.3 billion in job absenteeism and yet more in lost productivity. At the heart of this issue is a single unit of measurement \u2013 the calorie \u2013 and some seemingly straightforward arithmetic. \u201cTo lose weight, you must use up more calories than you take in,\u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dieters like Nash and Haelle could eat all their meals at McDonald\u2019s and still lose weight, provided they burn enough calories, says Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cReally, that\u2019s all it takes.\u201d Advertisement But Nash and Haelle do not find weight control so simple. And part of the problem goes way beyond individual self-control. The numbers logged in Nash\u2019s Fitbit, or printed on the food labels that Haelle reads religiously, are at best good guesses. Worse yet, as scientists are increasingly finding, some of those calorie counts are flat-out wrong \u2013 off by more than enough, for instance, to wipe out the calories Haelle burns by running an extra mile on a treadmill. A calorie isn\u2019t just a calorie. And our mistaken faith in the power of this seemingly simple measurement may be hindering the fight against obesity. \u00a7 \u00a9 Catherine Losing The process of counting calories begins in an anonymous office block in Maryland. The building is home to the Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, a facility run by the US Department of Agriculture. When we visit, the kitchen staff are preparing dinner for people enrolled in a study. Plastic dinner trays are laid out with meatloaf, mashed potatoes, corn, brown bread, a chocolate-chip scone, vanilla yoghurt and a can of tomato juice. The staff weigh and bag each item, sometimes adding an extra two-centimeter sliver of bread to ensure a tray\u2019s contents add up to the exact calorie requirements of each participant. \u201cWe actually get compliments about the food,\u201d says David Baer, a supervisory research physiologist with the Department. Advertisement The work that Baer and colleagues do draws on centuries-old techniques. Nestle traces modern attempts to understand food and energy back to a French aristocrat and chemist named Antoine Lavoisier. In the early 1780s, Lavoisier developed a triple-walled metal canister large enough to house a guinea pig. Inside the walls was a layer of ice. Lavoisier knew how much energy was required to melt ice, so he could estimate the heat the animal emitted by measuring the amount of water that dripped from the canister. What Lavoisier didn\u2019t realize \u2013 and never had time to find out; he was put to the guillotine during the Revolution \u2013 was that measuring the heat emitted by his guinea pigs was a way to estimate the amount of energy they had extracted from the food they were digesting. Until recently, the scientists at Beltsville used what was essentially a scaled-up version of Lavoisier\u2019s canister to estimate the energy used by humans: a small room in which a person could sleep, eat, excrete, and walk on a treadmill, while temperature sensors embedded in the walls measured the heat given off and thus the calories burned. (We now measure this energy in calories. Roughly speaking, one calorie is the heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.) Today, those \u2018direct-heat\u2019 calorimeters have largely been replaced by \u2018indirect-heat\u2019 systems, in which sensors measure oxygen intake and carbon dioxide exhalations. Scientists know how much energy is used during the metabolic processes that create the carbon dioxide we breathe out, so they can work backwards to deduce that, for example, a human who has exhaled 15 liters of carbon dioxide must have used 94 calories of energy. The facility\u2019s three indirect calorimeters are down the halls from the research kitchen. \u201cThey\u2019re basically nothing more than walk-in coolers, modified to allow people to live in here,\u201d physiologist William Rumpler explains as he shows us around. Inside each white room, a single bed is folded up against the wall, alongside a toilet, sink, a small desk and chair, and a short treadmill. A couple of airlocks allow food, urine, feces and blood samples to be passed back and forth. Apart from these reminders of the room\u2019s purpose, the vinyl-floored, fluorescent-lit units resemble a 1970s dorm room. Rumpler explains that subjects typically spend 24 to 48 hours inside the calorimeter, following a highly structured schedule. A notice pinned to the door outlines the protocol for the latest study: 6:00 to 6:45pm \u2013 Dinner, 11:00pm \u2013 Latest bedtime, mandatory lights out, 11:00pm to 6:30am \u2013 Sleep, remain in bed even if not sleeping. In between meals, blood tests and bowel movements, calorimeter residents are asked to walk on the treadmill at 3 miles per hour for 30 minutes. They fill the rest of the day with what Rumpler calls \u201clow activity\u201d. \u201cWe encourage people to bring knitting or books to read,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you give people free hand, you\u2019ll be surprised by what they\u2019ll do inside the chamber.\u201d He tells us that one of his less cooperative subjects smuggled in a bag of M&Ms, and then gave himself away by dropping them on the floor. Advertisement Using a bank of screens just outside the rooms, Rumpler can monitor exactly how many calories each subject is burning at any moment. Over the years, he and his colleagues have aggregated these individual results to arrive at numbers for general use: how many calories a 120-pound woman burns while running at 4.0 miles an hour, say, or the calories a sedentary man in his 60s needs to consume every day. It\u2019s the averages derived from thousands of extremely precise measurements that provide the numbers in Bo Nash\u2019s movement tracker and help Tara Haelle set a daily calorie intake target that is based on her height and weight. Measuring the calories in food itself relies on another modification of Lavoisier\u2019s device. In 1848, an Irish chemist called Thomas Andrews realized that he could estimate calorie content by setting food on fire in a chamber and measuring the temperature change in the surrounding water. (Burning food is chemically similar to the ways in which our bodies break food down, despite being much faster and less controlled.) Versions of Andrews\u2019s \u2018bomb calorimeter\u2019 are used to measure the calories in food today. At the Beltsville centre, samples of the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and tomato juice have been incinerated in the lab\u2019s bomb calorimeter. \u201cWe freeze-dry it, crush into a powder, and fire it,\u201d says Baer. Humans are not bomb calorimeters, of course, and we don\u2019t extract every calorie from the food we eat. This problem was addressed at the end of the 19th century, in one of the more epic experiments in the history of nutrition science. Wilbur Atwater, a Department of Agriculture scientist, began by measuring the calories contained in more than 4,000 foods. Then he fed those foods to volunteers and collected their feces, which he incinerated in a bomb calorimeter. After subtracting the energy measured in the feces from that in the food, he arrived at the Atwater values, numbers that represent the available energy in each gram of protein, carbohydrate and fat. These century-old figures remain the basis for today\u2019s standards. When Baer wants to know the calories per gram figure for that night\u2019s meatloaf, he corrects the bomb calorimeter results using Atwater values. Advertisement \u00a7 \u00a9 Catherine Losing This entire enterprise, from the Beltsville facility to the numbers on the packets of the food we buy, creates an aura of scientific precision around the business of counting calories. That precision is illusory. Advertisement The trouble begins at source, with the lists compiled by Atwater and others. Companies are allowed to incinerate freeze-dried pellets of product in a bomb calorimeter to arrive at calorie counts, though most avoid that hassle, says Marion Nestle. Some use the data developed by Atwater in the late 1800s. But the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also allows companies to use a modified set of values, published by the Department of Agriculture in 1955, that take into account our ability to digest different foods in different ways. Atwater\u2019s numbers say that Tara Haelle can extract 8.9 calories per gram of fat in a plate of her favorite Tex-Mex refried beans; the modified table shows that, thanks to the indigestibility of some of the plant fibers in legumes, she only gets 8.3 calories per gram. Depending on the calorie-measuring method that a company chooses \u2013 the FDA allows two more variations on the theme, for a total of five \u2013 a given serving of spaghetti can contain from 200 to 210 calories. These uncertainties can add up. Haelle and Bo Nash might deny themselves a snack or sweat out another few floors on the StairMaster to make sure they don\u2019t go 100 calories over their daily limit. If the data in their calorie counts is wrong, they can go over regardless. There\u2019s also the issue of serving size. After visiting over 40 US chain restaurants, including Olive Garden, Outback Steak House and PF Chang\u2019s China Bistro, Susan Roberts of Tufts University\u2019s nutrition research centre and colleagues discovered that a dish listed as having, say, 500 calories could contain 800 instead. The difference could easily have been caused, says Roberts, by local chefs heaping on extra french fries or pouring a dollop more sauce. It would be almost impossible for a calorie-counting dieter to accurately estimate their intake given this kind of variation. Advertisement Even if the calorie counts themselves were accurate, dieters like Haelle and Nash would have to contend with the significant variations between the total calories in the food and the amount our bodies extract. These variations, which scientists have only recently started to understand, go beyond the inaccuracies in the numbers on the back of food packaging. In fact, the new research calls into question the validity of nutrition science\u2019s core belief that a calorie is a calorie. Using the Beltsville facilities, for instance, Baer and his colleagues found that our bodies sometimes extract fewer calories than the number listed on the label. Participants in their studies absorbed around a third fewer calories from almonds than the modified Atwater values suggest. For walnuts, the difference was 21 per cent. This is good news for someone who is counting calories and likes to snack on almonds or walnuts: he or she is absorbing far fewer calories than expected. The difference, Baer suspects, is due to the nuts\u2019 particular structure: \u201cAll the nutrients \u2013 the fat and the protein and things like that \u2013 they\u2019re inside this plant cell wall.\u201d Unless those walls are broken down \u2013 by processing, chewing or cooking \u2013 some of the calories remain off-limits to the body, and thus are excreted rather than absorbed. Another striking insight came from an attempt to eat like a chimp. In the early 1970s, Richard Wrangham, an anthropologist at Harvard University and author of the book Catching Fire: How cooking made us human , observed wild chimps in Africa. Wrangham attempted to follow the entirely raw diet he saw the animals eating, snacking only on fruit, seeds, leaves, and insects such as termites and army ants. \u201cI discovered that it left me incredibly hungry,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then I realized that every human eats their food cooked.\u201d Wrangham and his colleagues have since shown that cooking unlaces microscopic structures that bind energy in foods, reducing the work our gut would otherwise have to do. It effectively outsources digestion to ovens and frying pans. Wrangham found that mice fed raw peanuts, for instance, lost significantly more weight than mice fed the equivalent amount of roasted peanut butter. The same effect holds true for meat: there are many more usable calories in a burger than in steak tartare. Different cooking methods matter, too. In 2015, Sri Lankan scientists discovered that they could more than halve the available calories in rice by adding coconut oil during cooking and then cooling the rice in the refrigerator. Wrangham\u2019s findings have significant consequences for dieters. If Nash likes his porterhouse steak bloody, for example, he will likely be consuming several hundred calories less than if he has it well-done. Yet the FDA\u2019s methods for creating a nutrition label do not for the most part account for the differences between raw and cooked food, or pureed versus whole, let alone the structure of plant versus animal cells. A steak is a steak, as far as the FDA is concerned. Advertisement Industrial food processing, which subjects foods to extremely high temperatures and pressures, might be freeing up even more calories. The food industry, says Wrangham, has been \u201cincreasingly turning our food to mush, to the maximum calories you can get out of it. Which, of course, is all very ironic, because in the West there\u2019s tremendous pressure to reduce the number of calories you\u2019re getting out of your food.\u201d He expects to find examples of structural differences that affect caloric availability in many more foods. \u201cI think there is work here for hundreds and probably thousands of nutritionists for years,\u201d he says. There\u2019s also the problem that no two people are identical. Differences in height, body fat, liver size, levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and other factors influence the energy required to maintain the body\u2019s basic functions. Between two people of the same sex, weight and age, this number may differ by up to 600 calories a day \u2013 over a quarter of the recommended intake for a moderately active woman. Even something as seemingly insignificant as the time at which we eat may affect how we process energy. In one recent study, researchers found that mice fed a high-fat diet between 9am and 5pm gained 28 per cent less weight than mice fed the exact same food across a 24-hour period. The researchers suggested that irregular feedings affect the circadian cycle of the liver and the way it metabolizes food, thus influencing overall energy balance. Such differences would not emerge under the feeding schedules in the Beltsville experiments. Until recently, the idea that genetics plays a significant role in obesity had some traction: researchers hypothesized that evolutionary pressures may have favored genes that predisposed some people to hold on to more calories in the form of added fat. Today, however, most scientists believe we can\u2019t blame DNA for making us overweight. \u201cThe prevalence of obesity started to rise quite sharply in the 1980s,\u201d says Nestle. \u201cGenetics did not change in that ten- or twenty-year period. So genetics can only account for part of it.\u201d Instead, researchers are beginning to attribute much of the variation to the trillions of tiny creatures that line the coiled tubes inside our midriffs. The microbes in our intestines digest some of the tough or fibrous matter that our stomachs cannot break down, releasing a flow of additional calories in the process. But different species and strains of microbes vary in how effective they are at releasing those extra calories, as well as how generously they share them with their host human. In 2013, researchers in Jeffrey Gordon\u2019s lab at Washington University tracked down pairs of twins of whom one was obese and one lean. He took gut microbes from each, and inserted them into the intestines of microbe-free mice. Mice that got microbes from an obese twin gained weight; the others remained lean, despite eating the exact same diet. \u201cThat was really striking,\u201d said Peter Turnbaugh, who used to work with Gordon and now heads his own lab at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIt suggested for the first time that these microbes might actually be contributing to the energy that we gain from our diet.\u201d Advertisement The diversity of microbes that each of us hosts is as individual as a fingerprint and yet easily transformed by diet and our environment. And though it is poorly understood, new findings about how our gut microbes affect our overall energy balance are emerging almost daily. For example, it seems that medications that are known to cause weight gain might be doing so by modifying the populations of microbes in our gut. In November 2015, researchers showed that risperidone, an antipsychotic drug, altered the gut microbes of mice who received it. The microbial changes slowed the animals\u2019 resting metabolisms, causing them to increase their body mass by 10 per cent in two months. The authors liken the effects to a 30-pound weight gain over one year for an average human, which they say would be the equivalent of an extra cheeseburger every day. Other evidence suggests that gut microbes might affect weight gain in humans as they do in lab animals. Take the case of the woman who gained more than 40 pounds after receiving a transplant of gut microbes from her overweight teenage daughter. The transplant successfully treated the mother\u2019s intestinal infection of Clostridium difficile , which had resisted antibiotics. But, as of the study\u2019s publication last year, she hadn\u2019t been able to shed the excess weight through diet or exercise. The only aspect of her physiology that had changed was her gut microbes. Advertisement All of these factors introduce a disturbingly large margin of error for an individual who is trying, like Nash, Haelle and millions of others, to count calories. The discrepancies between the number on the label and the calories that are actually available in our food, combined with individual variations in how we metabolize that food, can add up to much more than the 200 calories a day that nutritionists often advise cutting in order to lose weight. Nash and Haelle can do everything right and still not lose weight. None of this means that the calorie is a useless concept. Inaccurate as they are, calorie counts remain a helpful guide to relative energy values: standing burns more calories than sitting; cookies contain more calories than spinach. But the calorie is broken in many ways, and there\u2019s a strong case to be made for moving our food accounting system away from that one particular number. It\u2019s time to take a more holistic look at what we eat. \u00a7 \u00a9 Catherine Losing Advertisement Wilbur Atwater worked in a world with different problems. At the beginning of the 20th century, nutritionists wanted to ensure people were well fed. The calorie was a useful way to quantify a person\u2019s needs. Today, excess weight affects more people than hunger; 1.9 billion adults around the world are considered overweight, 600 million of them obese. Obesity brings with it a higher risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. This is a new challenge, and it is likely to require a new metric. One option is to focus on something other than energy intake. Like satiety, for instance. Picture a 300-calorie slice of cheesecake: it is going to be small. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to feel very dissatisfied with that meal,\u201d says Susan Roberts. If you eat 300 calories of a chicken salad instead, with nuts, olive oil and roasted vegetables, \u201cyou\u2019ve got a lot of different nutrients that are hitting all the signals quite nicely,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to feel full after you\u2019ve eaten it. That fullness is going to last for several hours.\u201d As a result of her research, Roberts has created a weight-loss plan that focuses on satiety rather than a straight calorie count. The idea is that foods that help people feel satisfied and full for longer should prevent them from overeating at lunch or searching for a snack soon after cleaning the table. Whole apples, white fish and Greek yoghurt are on her list of the best foods for keeping hunger at bay. Advertisement There\u2019s evidence to back up this idea: in one study, Roberts and colleagues found that people lost three times more weight by following her satiety plan compared with a traditional calorie-based one \u2013 and kept it off. Harvard nutritionist David Ludwig, who also proposes evaluating food on the basis of satiety instead of calories, has shown that teens given instant oats for breakfast consumed 650 more calories at lunch than their peers who were given the same number of breakfast calories in the form of a more satisfying omelette and fruit. Meanwhile, Adam Drewnowski, a epidemiologist at the University of Washington, has his own calorie upgrade: a nutrient density score. This system ranks food in terms of nutrition per calorie, rather than simply overall caloric value. Dark green vegetables and legumes score highly. Though the details of their approaches differ, all three agree: changing how we measure our food can transform our relationship with it for the better. Individual consumers could start using these ideas now. But persuading the food industry and its watchdogs, such as the FDA, to adopt an entirely new labelling system based on one of these alternative measures is much more of a challenge. Consumers are unlikely to see the calorie replaced by Roberts\u2019s or Drewnowski\u2019s units on their labels any time soon; nonetheless, this work is an important reminder that there are other ways to measure food, ones that might be more useful for both weight loss and overall health. Advertisement Down the line, another approach might eventually prove even more useful: personalized nutrition. Since 2005, David Wishart of the University of Alberta has been cataloguing the hundreds of thousands of chemical compounds in our bodies, which make up what\u2019s known as the human metabolome. There are now 42,000 chemicals on his list, and many of them help digest the food we eat. His food metabolome database is a more recent effort: it contains about 30,000 chemicals derived directly from food. Wishart estimates that both databases may end up listing more than a million compounds. \u201cHumans eat an incredible variety of foods,\u201d he says. \u201cThen those are all transformed by our body. And they\u2019re turned into all kinds of other compounds.\u201d We have no idea what they all are, he adds \u2013 or what they do. According to Wishart, these chemicals and their interactions affect energy balance. He points to research demonstrating that high-fructose corn syrup and other forms of added fructose (as opposed to fructose found in fruit) can trigger the creation of compounds that lead us to form an excess of fat cells, unrelated to additional calorie consumption. \u201cIf we cut back on some of these things,\u201d he says, \u201cit seems to revert our body back to more appropriate, arguably less efficient metabolism, so that we aren\u2019t accumulating fat cells in our body.\u201d It increasingly seems that there are significant variations in the way each one of us metabolizes food, based on the tens of thousands \u2013 perhaps millions \u2013 of chemicals that make up each of our metabolomes. This, in combination with the individuality of each person\u2019s gut microbiome, could lead to the development of personalized dietary recommendations. Wishart imagines a future where you could hold up your smartphone, snap a picture of a dish, and receive a verdict on how that food will affect you as well as how many calories you\u2019ll extract from it. Your partner might receive completely different information from the same dish. Advertisement Or maybe the focus will shift to tweaking your microbial community: if you\u2019re trying to lose weight, perhaps you will curate your gut microbiome so as to extract fewer calories without harming your overall health. Peter Turnbaugh cautions that the science is not yet able to recommend a particular set of microbes, let alone how best to get them inside your gut, but he takes comfort from the fact that our microbial populations are \u201cvery plastic and very malleable\u201d \u2013 we already know that they change when we take antibiotics, when we travel and when we eat different foods. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to figure this out,\u201d he says, \u201cthere is the chance that someday you might be able to tailor your microbiome\u201d to get the outcomes you want. None of these alternatives is ready to replace the calorie tomorrow. Yet the need for a new system of food accounting is clear. Just ask Haelle. \u201cI\u2019m kind of pissed at the scientific community for not coming up with something better for us,\u201d she confesses, recalling a recent meltdown at TGI Friday\u2019s as she navigated a confusing datasheet to find a low-calorie dish she could eat. There should be a better metric for people like her and Nash \u2013 people who know the health risks that come with being overweight and work hard to counter them. And it\u2019s likely there will be. Science has already shown that the calorie is broken. Now it has to find a replacement.

Don't Let This Pile Of Pasta Fool You.. It's Alive! The \"flying spaghetti monster\" is actually a complex colony of zooids. By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Aug 12, 2015, 11:47 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It's not surprising to find alien-like creatures lurking in the deep sea. But what about something that looks like it fell off your dinner plate, then grew a head? A team from energy giant BP recently stumbled upon a wiggly, pasta-like creature more than 4,000 feet under water off the Angola coast while using a remotely operated deep-sea vehicle for oil well maintenance, according to the journal New Scientist. They nicknamed it the \"flying spaghetti monster,\" after the satirical Internet diety of the fake Pastafarian religion, and sent the vehicle's video footage to Daniel Jones , a researcher who specializes in deep-sea ecology at the National Oceanography Centre in the U.K. As part of the SERPENT Project (a collaboration between researchers and energy company teams that operate remotely operated vehicles), Jones and his colleague Phil Pugh identified the creature as a species of bathyphysa conifera, in the order of the siphonophorae. \"To my knowledge this creature has only been observed a handful of times,\" Jones told The Huffington Post. Advertisement Siphonophores are colonial animals, according to researchers at Brown University's Dunn Lab , which means they actually are entire colonies of individual zooids . Each siphonophore begins as a single fertilized egg that reproduces asexually by cloning itself, sometimes thousands of times. Each new zooid has its own role within the colony and functions with the other clones as one living siphonophore. According to Jones, these colonies consist of a large anterior float (the grape-like \"head\" we see on the creature above) and a long, narrow stem which the feeding polyps (the tentacles) are inserted at fairly regular intervals. Advertisement \"The creature appears spaghetti-like because the stem is contracted up so that all the feeding zooids are jam-packed together,\" Jones told HuffPost. Some of the feeding polyps are not yet fully developed. \"In a way these specialized bodies function as organs ,\" Stefan Siebert, a marine biologists at Brown University, told Wired in 2014. \u201cSome move the colony, some feed for the colony, some take care of reproduction.\" Siphonophores are extremely fragile and can easily break into pieces . They can grow up to 160 feet, according to National Geographic, making them among the world's longest creatures .

It's Official: February Was The Warmest Month On Record \"It is yet another warning of the urgency of reducing global carbon emissions.\" By Lydia O'Connor Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 17, 2016, 03:25 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NOAA February shattered all-time monthly heat records, government agencies confirmed this week, inching global temperatures closer to the 2 degrees Celsius threshold at which some of climate change\u2019s effects will be beyond repair. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday that February was 1.21 degrees Celsius above the 20th-century average, making it the hottest month ever recorded since the agency began tracking data in 1880. It claims the title from December 2015, which previously set a record as the hottest month with temperatures 1.12 degrees above the 20th-century average. Advertisement NOAA's findings confirm records reported last weekend by NASA, which uses slightly different dates to determine the long-term average. According to its data, February was 1.35 degrees above base temperatures. In addition to being the hottest month ever recorded, February marks the 10th consecutive time a month has broken the all-time heat record for that particular month. NOAA Advertisement But by other accounts, February might have crossed one of the most significant climate benchmarks: a 2 degrees Celsius rise. The two government agencies derived their base period average temperature from the latter half of the 20th century, which is problematic because the industrial revolution and subsequent rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations started in the late 18th century, says Michael Mann, the director of Penn State Earth System Science Center and one of the scientists to spark a conversation about climate change . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Using an earlier base period, Mann says, February stands out. \"For the first time on record, we crossed the 2 degree C 'dangerous' level of warming (for the Northern Hemisphere, the best-measured part of the globe),\" he told The Huffington Post over email. \"It is unlikely we will see this anomalous warmth sustained for the remainder of the year, but it is a reminder of how perilously close we are now to permanent dangerous-levels of warmth.

Spacecraft Lifts Off In Search For Life On Mars The European-Russian mission is the latest to seek out Martian life. Maria Sheahan Mar 14, 2016, 10:02 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A Russian Proton-M rocket carrying the ExoMars 2016 spacecraft blasts off from the launch pad at the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodrome on March 14, 2016. KIRILL KUDRYAVTSEV via Getty Images Europe and Russia launched a spacecraft on Monday in a joint mission to sniff out signs of life on Mars and bring humans a step closer to flying to the red planet themselves. The craft, part of the ExoMars program, blasted off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan on board a Proton rocket, starting a seven-month journey through space. Advertisement It carries an atmospheric probe that is to study trace gases such as methane -- a chemical that on Earth is strongly tied to life -- that previous Mars missions have detected in the planet's atmosphere. \"Why are we so interested in Mars? We are trying to understand how life originated in our solar system,\" Pascale Ehrenfreund, chair of German space agency DLR's executive board, said at a launch event held by the European Space Agency. Scientists believe the methane could stem from micro-organisms, called methanogenes, that either became extinct millions of years ago and left gas frozen below the planet's surface, or that some methane-producing organisms still survive. Advertisement Another explanation for the methane in Mars's atmosphere could be that it is produced by geological phenomena, such as the oxidation of iron. The spacecraft will deploy a lander that will test technologies needed for a rover due to follow in 2018, one step in overcoming the practical and technological challenges facing possible future human flights to Mars. \"I'm sure in 20 years or 30 years the moment will come when humans will go to the planet,\" Thomas Reiter, director of Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration at the European agency, said. Advertisement EARLY LIFE? The second part of the ExoMars mission in 2018 will deliver a European rover to the surface of Mars. It will be the first with the ability to both move across the planet's surface and drill into the ground to collect and analyze samples. \"If there was early life it could have found refuge in the sub-surface, and the methane could be connected to that,\" ExoMars project scientist Jorge Vago said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Landing on Mars is a notoriously difficult task that has bedeviled nearly all of Russia's previous efforts and has given U.S. agency NASA trouble as well. The United States currently has two operational rovers on Mars, Curiosity and Opportunity.

Scientists Map Acorn Worm DNA, And Learn A Lot About Humans In The Process Turns out we share DNA with a lot of unexpected critters -- and bananas. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 20, 2015, 10:42 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT You'd never know at first glance, but human beings have a surprising amount in common with acorn worms . More than 500 million years ago, humans and these soft-bodied invertebrates had a common ancestor, as Live Science reports. And to this day, we share about 14,000 genes. In fact, in terms of genetic makeup, we are 70 percent similar, according to the findings of a new study . Advertisement Humans, meet your slithering underwater cousins. An adult acorn worm with its proboscis on the bottom right and tail on the top left. Ariel Pani/Marine Biological Laboratory For the study, published in the journal Nature , researchers analyzed genes from two acorn worm species collected off Hawaii and from the Atlantic Ocean. As Berkeley News reports, the newly sequenced genomes are shedding light on the evolution of pharyngeal slits (which acorn worms use to filter food from seawater) into gills and then into the pharynx, the organ that gives humans the ability to bite, chew, swallow and speak. Advertisement \u201cThe presence of these slits in acorn worms and vertebrates tells us that our last common ancestor also had them, and was likely a filter feeder like acorn worms today,\u201d Daniel Rokhsar, a leader of the sequencing effort and a University of California Berkeley professor, told Berkeley News. These worms aren't the only bizarre critters humans share a significant percentage of genes with. While numbers vary depending on the source, here's a look at just how similar our DNA is to everything from chimpanzees to yeast. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Mountain Lion Tracked By Scientists Is Found Dead Near Malibu Road The loss of the famed cougar is one more reason for a California wildlife corridor to protect the big cats, animal advocates say. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Feb 2, 2018, 01:11 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT P-23 is gone. Courtesy National Park Service A mother cougar has been found dead near Malibu Canyon Road after apparently being struck by a vehicle, officials have revealed. \u201cUnfortunately, her life came to an end prematurely due to the challenge of navigating the complex road network in this area,\u201d Jeff Sikich, biologist for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area , said in a statement. Advertisement We're saddened to report that mountain lion P-23 appears to have been struck and killed by a vehicle on Malibu Canyon Rd. We found her remains a few days ago near the road. She's the 18th mountain lion killed by a vehicle since our study began in 2002. pic.twitter.com/7N6nKL2c2p \u2014 Santa Monica Mtns (@SantaMonicaMtns) February 1, 2018 The nearly 6-year-old California mountain lion , dubbed P-23 by scientists tracking her, was the mother of two kittens (including P-54 ) born about a year ago, her third litter. Their fate is unknown , but they\u2019re close to the age when kittens typically leave their mother to strike out on their own, said a statement by the National Park Service. We've been tracking P-23 since she was just a few weeks old, through her dispersal from mom and the birth of three of her own litters. She was 5.5 years old. pic.twitter.com/GrDEwq2vTn \u2014 Santa Monica Mtns (@SantaMonicaMtns) February 1, 2018 Advertisement The death this week is the latest sign of the difficult battle for survival the big cats face in the Santa Monica and Santa Ana mountains of the Los Angeles area as housing and highways increasingly encroach on their habitat and inhibit their searches for prey and mates. Los Angeles is one of only two major cities in the world, along with Mumbai, that have big cats living within the city limits. \u201cMountain lions are incredible animals that have adapted to live in California\u2019s mountains, canyons and deserts. But these big cats are no match for the network of roads, highways, and sprawl that we\u2019ve built with little regard for their impacts on lions or wildlife connectivity,\u201d J.P. Rose, lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity , told Huffpost. The National Park Service has studied about 60 mountain lions in and around the Santa Monica Mountains. About 20 adult cougars are believed to live in the Santa Ana Mountains. Advertisement P-23 is the 18th mountain lion to be killed in a road collision in the region since 2002. Wildlife and environmental activists have been advocating for the construction of a wildlife crossing over U.S. 101, which would allow for safe, freer access throughout the area by the big cats. The Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing would create a 200-foot-long, 165-foot-wide overpass bridging U.S. 101 west of Liberty Canyon Road in the city of Agoura Hills, but the mission has lagged due to a lack of funds. The California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, released an environmental assessment in September and is reviewing public comments on the project. The Center for Biological Diversity and other groups support use of state funds for the project. \u201cThe crossing is necessary to preserve wildlife connectivity in Southern California that has been disrupted by poor land use and transportation planning,\u201d said Rose. The center last month joined with the Sierra Club and the Mountain Lion Foundation in a lawsuit against the Altair housing development approved by the city of Temecula in the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California. The suit argues that the 200-acre development and a multi-lane highway would impede the only passage left in the area for wildlife to move between coastal and inland mountains. Advertisement P-23 had been a favorite of mountain lion watchers ever since she was spotted by a cyclist in 2013 astride a dead deer on Mulholland Highway in Los Angeles. She's probably most famous for this incredible photo from 2013, when she was dragging a deer off Mulholland Hwy and a cyclist happened to ride by. Went viral on our Facebook page! pic.twitter.com/NcEkNKWY88 \u2014 Santa Monica Mtns (@SantaMonicaMtns) February 1, 2018 P-23\u2032s first two litters were preyed upon by mountain lions or other wildlife. Two kittens from her first litter, P-36 and P-37, were photographed in 2015 being attacked and eaten by P-27, a dominant male in the Santa Monica Mountains. The other dominant male at the time was the kittens\u2019 father, P-12. Advertisement Two kittens from P-23\u2032s second litter were also killed by a mountain lion or other wildlife. But a third, surprise, survivor (P-53) was later discovered by researchers. P-23's kittens from her first litter, P-36 and P-37, were later attacked and eaten by an adult male mountain lion in 2015. National Park Service Adult male P-27 is photographed about to attack one of P-23's kittens in 2015. Courtesy National Park Service Advertisement Here\u2019s a 2015 video of P-53, making the characteristic \u201cchirping\u201d sounds of a mountain lion kitten. P-23 was a prime example of what\u2019s known as \u201cfirst-order\u201d inbreeding among the cougars of the area, another problem caused by territory constraints from housing developments and highways. Such inbreeding threatens the survival of the species. P-23 was the result of a mating of P-12 and his daughter. P-23 later also mated with P-12, who was both her father and grandfather, to produce P-36 and P-37. P-23\u2032s half sibling is suspected of being the father of her latest litter. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Rare Oarfish, Stuff Of Sea Monster Legends, Washes Up In New Zealand, Then Vanishes Creature Of Sea Monster Legends Washes Up Near Harbor, Then Vanishes By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 21, 2015, 10:16 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A bizarre-looking ocean fish that marine experts say could be the origin of some \u201csea monster\u201d legends washed ashore in New Zealand last week -- then mysteriously disappeared. The nearly 10-foot-long oarfish was found at a salt marsh near Otago Harbor in Aramoana on Thursday , the Otago Daily Times reports. The local who found the scaly animal called Department of Conservation service manager David Agnew, who said it\u2019s the first time he's spotted such a creature in his 20 years on the job. Agnew told the Daily Mail he had never even heard of an oarfish before. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly rare to see them in New Zealand,\u201d he said. Advertisement Researchers from the Otago Museum took some samples of the fish for study, but did not have the resources to remove and preserve the entire carcass, natural science curator Emma Burns told the Otago Daily Times. She noted they had not determined the sex and age of the fish, but did know that the critter consumed a \u201cbig feed of krill\u201d before its demise. By Friday, the fish had disappeared, and it\u2019s unclear if the body was washed away by the tide or removed by humans. Agnew warned anyone who may come in contact with the fish not to eat it, since no one knows the cause of death. Plus, the meat doesn\u2019t even taste good, according to Burns. She told the Daily Times the flesh is \u201cquite gelatinous.\u201d Advertisement \u201cOarfish\u201d describes a group of fish that includes four species. One of these, the giant oarfish -- also known as the \u201cking of herrings\u201d -- can grow up to 36 feet long. Oarfish can be found worldwide, though sightings of live oarfish are relatively uncommon. The fish are known for the ability to \u201cself-amputate.\u201d Though some media sources say the fish accomplishes self-amputation by biting off their tails, FishBase.org and the Encyclopedia of Life both indicate that oarfish -- which are toothless -- simply detach the back part of their bodies. Though it\u2019s unknown why oarfish self-amputate, they do so several times over the course of their lives, according to the Encyclopedia of Life. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Since the huge fish have a history of washing up on beaches and floating near the surface of water, they \u201cmay be the origin of some \u2018sea monster\u2019 myths,\u201d according to a Facebook post by the New Zealand Marine Studies Centre and Aquarium.

New NASA Photo Shows Saturn In A Whole New Light Saturn the fearsome. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 12, 2015, 03:29 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The ancient Romans saw Saturn as the god of agriculture and fertility, a generally benevolent and peaceful deity. Saturn's sometime partner, Lua , on the other hand, brought illness to Roman enemies and oversaw the destruction of their weapons. In this image published on Monday, NASA seems to have captured two parts Lua and one part Saturn with the mix of shadows and light. Advertisement Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute NASA's Cassini spacecraft captured the photo, titled \"Darkness Descending,\" in May of this year, using a wide-angle lens and an infrared filter at a distance of about 930,000 miles from the planet's surface. Per a release from the space agency, this particular infrared filter helps scientists locate methane on the planet, which is useful in determining the dynamics of Saturn's atmosphere: Advertisement Methane is not a major component of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, but enough of it is present to make a difference in how much light is reflected by different clouds. The darker areas reveal clouds that are lower in the atmosphere, therefore under more methane. Bright areas on Saturn are higher altitude clouds. Scientists think that these lower-altitude clouds are in regions where \u201cair\u201d is descending while the higher-altitude clouds are in regions where air is rising. Thus, images like this one can help us map the vertical air movements on Saturn. NASA also released a near-infrared photo of the planet last week (see below), in which two of the planet's moons, Dione (left) and Mimas (right), straddle Saturn's rings brightly in the foreground, while Saturn looms ominously behind: Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute Advertisement While Saturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system, it appears particularly large in the above photo as Dione has a diameter of only 698 miles and Mimas' is just 246 miles. For comparison, Earth is just over 7,900 miles in diameter while Saturn stretches 75,400 miles.

A 'Super Blue Blood Moon' Is Going To Light Up The Sky. Here's Where To See It. NASA is calling it a \"lunar trifecta.\" By Carol Kuruvilla Religion Reporter, HuffPost Jan 24, 2018, 05:50 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Scientists and space enthusiasts are preparing for a lunar event so rare that it only happens once in a blue moon \u2015 or, to be more specific, once in a super blue blood moon. People living in certain parts of the Western Hemisphere will be able to see a reddish and unusually large moon glowing on the celestial stage early in the morning on Jan. 31. NASA is calling it a \u201clunar trifecta,\u201d since it\u2019s a combination of three distinct events. Advertisement An illustration of a super blue blood moon from NASA. NASA First, the moon that morning will be a \u201csupermoon,\u201d since it\u2019s occurring near a perigee, or a time in the moon\u2019s orbit when it is closest to the Earth. This means that the moon will be about 14 percent brighter than usual, according to NASA . Secondly, it is the second full moon of the month. Full moons are typically separated by 29 days . Usually, every calendar month only has one full moon, but sometimes, a second one squeezes in. When this happens, as it will on Jan. 31, the event is commonly referred to as a \u201cblue\u201d moon. Advertisement But what will really make the Jan. 31 moon spectacular for some viewers is the fact that it will be happening during a total lunar eclipse. That means the moon will pass through the Earth\u2019s shadow and take on a reddish glow \u2015 which gives it the nickname \u201cblood moon.\u201d This is the second supermoon to light up the sky this January. The first occurred on Jan. 1 , and was the biggest Americans will see year. The last time people in North America were treated to a blue moon occurring simultaneously with a total lunar eclipse was over 150 years ago, according to Space.com . Advertisement A NASA graphic showcases a timeline for the upcoming eclipse. NASA The \u201csuper blue blood moon\u201d will be most visible to people on western part of North America, Alaska, and the Hawaiian islands, according to Gordon Johnston, program executive and lunar blogger at NASA. People on the East Coast will not have as great a view, since the eclipse begins just as the moon is about to set and the sky is getting lighter. Johnston advises East Coasters who want to give moon viewing a chance to be outside at about 6:45 a.m. EST. It\u2019s best to head to a viewing point at a higher elevation, with a clear line of sight to the horizon toward the west. Advertisement Americans living in the Central time zone will have a better view. The Earth\u2019s reddish shadow will be noticeable on the moon by about 6:15 a.m. CST. The best viewing will be on the West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska. The eclipse begins at 3:48 a.m. PST and will reach a peak between 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. \u201cWeather permitting, the West Coast, Alaska and Hawaii will have a spectacular view of totality [the eclipse] from start to finish,\u201d said Johnston. Advertisement While the Jan. 31 lunar eclipse will be tough to see from some parts of the United States, there are other spectacular heavenly displays in store for Americans in the future. Johnston said another lunar eclipse will occur on Jan. 21, 2019, that will be visible throughout the country. Although that one will be a supermoon, it won\u2019t be a blue moon.

Joseph Okpako via Getty Images So if you\u2019re on the West Coast, the \u201csuper blue blood moon\u201d may be worth waking up early for. \u201cSet your alarm early and go out and take a look,\u201d Johnston said. Use this site to see when and how long the upcoming super blue blood moon will be visible near you. The Virtual Telescope Project will be livestreaming the eclipse here.

What's Happening In Your Brain During 'Microsleep' Here's what you need to know about one of the most dangerous consequences of sleep deprivation. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 12, 2016, 07:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Microsleep can cause you to nod off at the computer for just a few seconds. Jan Stromme/Getty Images We've all experienced it: You're completely exhausted after pulling an all-nighter, and despite your best efforts to stay awake, your eyelids keep closing and closing until suddenly you nod off for just a second -- only to awake with a jerk. This phenomenon is what's known as \"microsleep,\" a momentary and involuntary pocket of temporary unconsciousness lasting from a fraction of a second up to roughly 10 seconds, ending in a sudden head jolt. Advertisement Why does our brain enter these periods of microsleep? They're typically caused by extreme fatigue. Sleep is a basic biological necessity, and when we force ourselves to go without it for too long, the brain will eventually shut down -- even if just for a few seconds. During microsleep, your brain is essentially taking a forced nap, because its current level of sleep deprivation is preventing certain areas and networks from functioning. Here's a look at the science of microsleep -- and why it can be so dangerous. It's your brain's losing struggle between sleep and wakefulness. In the battle to stay awake, sometimes your brain loses. A study published in the journal Neuroimage investigated microsleep by keeping a group of volunteers awake for 22 hours. The volunteers were then put in a dark fMRI machine and asked not to fall asleep. The brain scanner detected when they nodded off periodically, and looked at what was going on in their brains. During these bursts of microsleep, there was reduced activity in the thalamus, a region of the brain involved in regulating sleep. Interestingly, there was also increased activity in brain regions responsible for sensory processing and paying attention -- functions that are, of course, critical to wakefulness. This suggests that parts of the brain are in \"waking\" mode while other areas temporarily succumb to the urge to sleep. Advertisement You may not even be aware of it happening. While sleep deprivation affects the whole brain, it's possible for certain parts of the brain to be affected much more severely. During microsleep, certain parts of the brain can nod off while others remain active. A 2011 University of Wisconsin study found that some nerve cells in a sleep-deprived but awake brain can go briefly \"offline,\" entering a sleep-like state while the rest of the brain remains awake. \"We know that when we are sleepy, we make mistakes, our attention wanders and our vigilance goes down,\" Dr. Chiara Cirelli, a professor of psychiatry at the university and one of the study's authors, said in a statement at the time . \"We have seen with EEGs that even while we are awake, we can experience short periods of 'microsleep.'\" It's a frighteningly common factor in drowsy driving accidents. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of microsleep episodes is that they're common at the wheel, and they can lead to accidents. In fact, microsleep has been said to be the most common cause of falling asleep behind the wheel. Advertisement According to the U.K. road safety charity Brake , 45 percent of men and 22 percent of women surveyed admitted to microsleeping while driving. Shift workers driving home after night shifts are at a high risk for crashes caused by microsleep. A small study published in December found that night shift workers are significantly more likely to have a crash when they're coming off a shift as compared to when they're fully rested, largely due to microsleep. An alarming study conducted in 2012 found that many of these accidents could have been prevented if drivers got off the road at the early signs of drowsiness. The findings showed that many people continue driving drowsily even after they experience microsleep episodes. Advertisement \"People may know they are too sleepy to drive safely but they are pushing themselves to stay awake,\" Dr. Chris Watling, study author and researcher at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said in a 2012 statement . \"That's when we can get into difficulty with driving.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Bear Known For Lounging Shows She *Nose* Computers Who knew bears were so brainy? By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jul 15, 2016, 12:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Migwan, a brainy black bear at the Detroit Zoo. Patti Truesdell/Detroit Zoological Society Are bears brainier than we thought? New research on Migwan, a North American black bear at the Detroit Zoo, shows that bears are able to connect photographs of objects with the objects themselves . It\u2019s believed to be the first time that Ursus americanus or any other bear species has been shown to have this ability, which has been seen in dogs, monkeys, pigeons and other animals. Migwan was born in the wild but was brought to the zoo as a cub in 2002 after being found with her face full of porcupine quills. She spends her days sitting in odd positions with her legs out or lounging at the front of her habitat with her arms crossed, according to the zoo\u2019s website. Advertisement But Migwan took a break from lounging to participate in the research, in which she showed that she was able to press her nose to a computer screen to \u201cchoose\u201d the images of playthings she had been trained to recognize. Pretty impressive, for sure. But exactly what Migwan knows about the link between images viewed on a computer screen and their real-world counterparts isn\u2019t quite clear. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if she is \u2018representing\u2019 the photographs as real objects because we don\u2019t know if she thinks the photograph IS the object, or understands the representational nature, in that photos are like objects but not exactly the same,\u201d Zoe Johnson-Ulrich, a graduate student in psychology at the University of Oakland in Michigan and one of the researchers, told The Huffington Post in an email. Advertisement For example, she added, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat a photograph of an apple.\u201d No, but you can use a photograph to show what you like to eat. In subsequent research, Johnson-Ulrich said, Migwan was able to show by touching her nose to the computer screen that she really, really likes grapes \u2015 beets, not so much. Migwan in another dramatic pose. Roy Lewis Johnson-Ulrich, who co-authored a paper about the research which was published online June 24 in the journal Animal Cognition, said there was no reason to believe that Migwan is a special bear.

Far-Out Photos Reveal The Beautiful Bacteria Living In Our Teeth Here's a fluorescent look at the ecosystem in your mouth. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 30, 2016, 07:01 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Who knew the microbes in our mouths could look so magnificent? A team of researchers in Massachusetts used a novel fluorescence imaging technique and DNA sequencing to build colorful maps of bacteria found in our teeth. The images are not only stunning to look at, but also shed light on how various kinds of bacteria organize as colonies , Dr. Jessica Mark Welch, a co-author of the study and an associate research scientist at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, said in a statement. \"Microbes behave very differently depending on where they are and who they are next to,\" she said. \"They will secrete entirely different sets of chemicals and metabolites depending on who their microbial neighbors are. So, if we want to accurately describe what these microbes are doing -- really, what they are -- we need to know where they are.\" Advertisement The researchers collected the bacteria from the dental plaque of 22 healthy men and women , National Geographic reported. They published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Jan. 25. The researchers concluded that the fluorescent imaging technology they used could be used again to map the microbes lurking in our guts and skin. \"Our research provides the map, which will allow us to answer important questions about the relationship between the bacteria and the body -- and ultimately help us to understand the effect on our overall health,\" said Dr. Gary Borisy, a co-author of the study and senior research investigator in the Forsyth Institute's department of microbiology .

Dinosaur Skeleton Reveals Babies May Have Lived On Their Own From Birth Giant dinosaurs were small and cute at birth, a study of baby Rapetosaurus bones reveals. By Michael McLaughlin Reporter, HuffPost Apr 21, 2016, 07:36 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The rare discovery of a fossilized skeleton from a newborn dinosaur suggests that some long-necked plant eaters lived on their own from the moment they hatched from eggs. Paleontologists who recently examined the fossils of a weeks-old Rapetosaurus, found in Madagascar, said the partial skeleton may lead to a new understanding of the group of dinosaurs known as sauropods, which included some of the largest creatures to ever walk on land. Advertisement The fossils also suggest that a baby Rapetosaurus grew rapidly toward its gigantic adult dimensions. \"We never knew anything about what they looked like when they were babies. We haven't had any data that can shed light on the question until now,\" Kristi Curry Rogers, paleontologist at Macalester College in Minnesota, said in a video (above) announcing the research. She added that the skeleton was \"the smallest of its kind out of an egg.\" The remains were small enough that they were initially misidentified as coming from a fossilized crocodile . They were mixed among other fossils until Rogers recognized their significance. Rogers and her team published their findings in the journal Science on Thursday. Advertisement A comparison of an adult Rapetosaurus , a baby Rapetosaurus and a human. Kristi Curry Rogers Living about 67 million years ago, an adult Rapetosaurus -- a type of titanosaur -- could reach a length of 15 meters, or 49 feet. The fossils were from a specimen that \"was probably only about 35 centimeters, or knee height,\" Rogers said. \"You could have picked this animal up and carried it just like you could carry a golden retriever.\" After analyzing the fossils, the researchers estimated that the baby dinosaur may have grown from being around 7.5 pounds (3.4 kilograms) when it hatched to about 88 pounds (40 kilograms) when it died, National Geographic reported . Advertisement \"That\u2019s like going from chihuahua to a Great Dane in six weeks,\" Sarah Werning , a paleontologist at Des Moines University who was not involved in the study, told National Geographic. The egg that it hatched from was likely the size of a soccer ball, according to the National Science Foundation , which funded the research. The baby dinosaur not only was small, but also likely adorable. \"There is no doubt that these baby titanosaurs would have had some of the features we would normally associate with cuteness or baby-ness: short snout, large eyes, big head for a body -- like a puppy,\" Luis Chiappe, director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, who wasn't involved in the research but praised it, told The Associated Press . Advertisement The preserved skeleton of the baby Rapetosaurus , including several vertebrae from the hip and tail. Kristi Curry Rogers From birth, the Rapetosaurus was more coordinated than full-grown adults and survived without parental care, according to the scientists. \"These little sauropods would hatch from their eggs and they would really be on their own in a really rough environment,\" said Rogers in the video. Advertisement An analysis of the cartilage growth plates of this particular dinosaur suggests it may have died of starvation. Rogers also published a paper in 2001 about discovering the first fossils of an adult Rapetosaurus in Madagascar in 1996, when she was a graduate student . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Earlier this week, other scientists published a report concluding that dinosaurs may have already been dying off tens of millions of years before a devastating asteroid led to their demise. According to that paper, sauropods like the Rapetosaurus were the kinds of dinosaurs dying at the fastest rate.

New Evidence of Prehistoric Trade With Asia Found at Bering Land Bridge Site Now another newly analyzed object from the University of Colorado-led Cape Espenberg dig is providing more evidence of prehistoric trade or contacts between the residents of Northwest Alaska and their neighbors across the Bering Strait.

Four years ago, archaeologists announced they had found evidence on the Alaska side of the Bering Strait of trade with Asia that dated back about 1,000 years. The evidence was a bronze fastener, possibly a belt buckle, that was created in eastern Asia and found at a site at Cape Espenberg in Alaska's archaeologically rich Bering Land Bridge National Preserve. Now another newly analyzed object from the University of Colorado-led Cape Espenberg dig is providing more evidence of prehistoric trade or contacts between the residents of Northwest Alaska and their neighbors across the Bering Strait. Advertisement A flake of obsidian, a glassy volcanic rock, found at the site has been traced to Russia's Chukotka peninsula. Obsidian, formed from molten rock that hardens too quickly to form crystals, carries the chemical fingerprint of its source. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 12, 2015, 02:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The longest space travel simulation ever conducted on U.S. soil is about to begin on Hawaii's Big Island. On Aug. 28, the fourth Hawaii Space Exploration and Analog and Simulation mission will begin, with six scientists spending a full year inside an isolated, solar-powered dome atop the Mauna Loa volcano. Their goal: Prepare humans for life on Mars. A HI-SEAS scientist atop a ridge near the habitat. Sian Proctor/HI-SEAS, University of Hawaii Advertisement The mission, which is scheduled to last four months longer than the last HI-SEAS undertaking, will allow researchers to better understand the risks associated with space travel. The crew of three men and three women will live inside a 1,000-square-foot Mars-like habitat, located 8,200 feet above sea level. They'll only be allowed to venture outside while dressed in full spacesuits, and contact with the outside world will be limited to email messages -- which will be artificially delayed 20 minutes to simulate communication in space. Advertisement Using cameras, body movement trackers and electronic surveys, researchers will gather data on a wide range of cognitive, social and emotional factors that could affect team performance in actual outer space. \u201cWe hope that this upcoming mission will build on our current understanding of the social and psychological factors involved in long duration space exploration and give  solid data on how best to select and support a flight crew that will work cohesively as a team while in space,\" Kim Binsted, HI-SEAS principal investigator and a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said in a statement last month.

Credit: Zak Wilson/ HI-SEAS, University of Hawaii Advertisement It may not be the Hawaii vacation that most people dream of, but hundreds of people applied to be part of the simulated Mars mission nonetheless. \"They actually competed for it,\" Binsted told The Huffington Post of the scientists selected. Sheyna Gifford, a researcher in astrophysics, neuroscience and psychology from St. Louis, is among those chosen for the upcoming mission and will serve as the team's medical officer. In an interview with OnStL Radio, Gifford said she always dreamed of becoming an astronaut and that she'd even consider going to Mars, if the opportunity ever came along. Advertisement \"I'm more concerned that we get there as a society,\" she told OnStL. \"And then if I have the opportunity, maybe later on in my life, that would be a really neat thing to do. But first things first. Let's take the first step.\" According to goals outlined in the U.S. National Space Policy, NASA hopes to send astronauts to Mars at some point in the 2030s. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Already Threatened Polar Bears Face Food Shortage Crisis Amid Climate Change We're certainly not making it easier for them. By Andy McDonald Writer, HuffPost Feb 2, 2018, 04:23 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The situation is becoming more and more grim for the polar bear. New research published in the journal Science on Thursday found that polar bears have metabolic rates 60 percent higher than scientists previously thought, meaning the animals require more food to survive their harsh Arctic environment than was previously known. Polar bears already face challenges due to the effects of climate change on natural habitats, and the new information means it will become even more difficult for them to adapt to receding sea ice. The polar bear\u2019s diet is high in fat, supplied largely by hunting seals, but with less Arctic ice, scientists worry that the bears will have to walk or swim greater and greater distances for food with each passing year. Advertisement The researchers used radio collars to track nine female polar bears near the Beaufort Sea. Using collected blood samples, scientists found that five of the bears lost body mass due to malnutrition. Four of the bears lost 10 percent body weight in just a 10-day period. Olaf Kruger In 2017, the world\u2019s oceans reached their hottest temperatures on record. And since 2010, the Earth has experienced the five warmest years ever recorded . Advertisement Over 77,000 square miles of winter sea ice have disappeared in the last 40 years, according to The Guardian . \u201cThat process takes them [polar bears] further and further away from land \u2015 and there is likely to be a limit about the distance they can tolerate,\u201d Leeds University professor of Earth observation Andrew Shepherd told The Guardian last year. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Josef Friedhuber via Getty Images Advertisement Lead author of the new study , research wildlife biologist Anthony Pagano, said the new findings require further study. \u201cThe next step is to use this information to really start to quantify how changes in movement patterns might be affecting the energy demands of these bears.\u201d Unfortunately, if global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, the impact on the Arctic ecosystem will likely continue to making things worse for polar bears.

New Study Decodes When Working From Home Is Actually Productive Researchers found there are a few key things that indicate whether it's a good idea for an employee to work remotely. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Sep 26, 2015, 08:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Kelvin Murray via Getty Images Working from home can be pretty great. You can send emails from the comfort of your couch and avoid commuting. Plus, away from the stress of the office, you might actually get more done while also enjoying better work-life balance. But remote working can also be ... well, not so productive . So far, scientists have reached somewhat mixed conclusions about the merits of WFH. Some studies have pointed to benefits like increased productivity , better performance on tasks, higher job satisfaction, lower work stress and an enhanced work-life balance. Others have found issues with the practice, including possible conflicts with family demands . Advertisement Now, a comprehensive scientific review of the literature finds that how you work from home can predict whether you and your company will reap the benefits. The report, recently published in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest , finds that working from home is most effective if implemented in a way that meets the needs of both the individual and the organization. \"There are a variety of factors to consider, such as job responsibilities, individual desires and capabilities, and organizational needs and practices,\" Dr. Tammy Allen, an organizational psychologist at the University of South Florida and co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"It is important to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\" Advertisement Positive outcomes were most likely if specific conditions were met. Employees and employers reaped the greatest benefits from telecommuting when it was practiced in moderation and workers still had plenty of face time at the office. \"Telecommuting appears to work best when it is practiced to a moderate degree,\" Allen said. \"Face-to-face meetings may be especially important during the early stage of new projects.\" It also worked better when employees were given the freedom to decide when they wanted to WFH, and when they had more flexible timelines for submitting their work. Advertisement Still, telecommuting isn't without its challenges, as the study's authors note. The report highlighted potential challenges of WFH, including fuzzy boundaries between work and family roles, long hours that may result in overwork, and lack of face-to-face interactions with coworkers. Based on their findings, the researchers suggest that employers \"ensure that remote workers are carefully selected and ... that opportunities for interactions with coworkers are provided.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Pecking Pigeons Detect Breast Cancer Through food reinforcement training, the birds had a \"remarkable ability\" to distinguish malignant and benign tissue. By Whitney Meers Trends Writer, The Huffington Post Nov 20, 2015, 11:21 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Pigeons are no bird brains. These animals could help scientists make big advances in the world of breast cancer research, according to a peer-reviewed research article published this week in PLOS One titled \"Pigeons (Columba livia) as Trainable Observers of Pathology and Radiology Breast Cancer Images.\" Study leaders trained 16 birds to review digitized renderings from mammograms and biopsy slides, rewarding them with food for correct answers. Advertisement The researchers taught the pigeons to peck colored buttons to differentiate between benign and malignant slides and mammograms , and the birds learned through trial and error, Smithsonian Magazine reports. To avoid the Clever Hans effect , which refers to a horse that was once believed to be able to do arithmetic but was in actuality simply responding to his human audience, the pigeons did all their learning in a box with no humans visible, according to Science . University of Iowa Advertisement With food reinforcement training, the pigeons had a \"remarkable ability\" to distinguish between malignant and benign tissue, and were able to generalize their knowledge and apply it to images they'd never seen before, according to the study. \u201cPigeons may not be able to write poetry, but they\u2019ve had millions of years to develop the abilities that they need to navigate a very complicated and dangerous world,\u201d study leader Richard Levenson, a professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of California, Davis, told Smithsonian . \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t surprise me that they can do pathology!\" Pathologists and radiologists work for years to refine their visual skills in order to identify problems, but based on the rapid speed at which pigeons were able to learn to tell the difference between the malignant and benign images, it seems they could potentially serve as surrogate observers of medical images in the future. Advertisement The researchers found that the pigeons improved their ability to tell the difference between malignant and benign breast tissue from 50 percent at the start of the study to 85 percent by day 15. By day 25, they were correct 90 percent of the time. However, the birds' pecks aren't a fail-safe way to tell if a person has cancer. Color and image quality both affected the bird's selections. When it came to radiology, the pigeons were also able to detect cancer-relevant microcalcifications -- calcium deposits that could be indicative of breast cancer. But they had a harder time identifying certain tissue densities that were indicative of breast cancer. Advertisement Humans often encounter the same problem, as spotting suspicious densities in mammogram images is notoriously difficult. Pigeons share many visual systems properties with humans, the paper says, which inspired the study. The findings suggest pigeons can help evaluate new imaging technologies. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Billionaire Paul Allen's Yacht Wrecks Cayman Islands Coral Reef He faces fines of up to $600,000. By Michael McLaughlin Reporter, HuffPost Jan 29, 2016, 08:02 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT One of the world's largest yachts , owned by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, destroyed 14,000 square feet of reef in the Cayman Islands. The anchor chain of the 300-foot luxury boat, named the MV Tatoosh, damaged more than 80 percent of the coral in about a quarter-acre of protected territory earlier this month, according to the Cayman News Service . The damage occurred near an area popular with scuba divers. Advertisement Allen, 63, was not on board at the time, according to his company Vulcan, which blamed the local port officials for telling the boat's crew where to position the Tatoosh. Reuters said the five-decker vessel is the 49th-largest yacht in the world. Winds reportedly shifted to push the boat into the reef. The crew left the area when the damage was discovered. The irony of the mishap is that Allen is a conservationist \"working to save endangered species [and] improve ocean health,\" according to his corporate biography . Allen, 63, is the world's 26th richest man, with a net worth of $19.2 billion, according to Forbes . He also owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trailblazers. Advertisement A Cayman Island environmental department will release a full report about the reef's damage next week, according to the Cayman News Service. Allen faces fines of up to $600,000. He and the crew are cooperating with investigators, CNN reported.

By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post and Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Sep 26, 2015, 09:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Why are some people sharp as a tack at 95 years old, while others begin struggling with mental clarity in their 50s? A lot of it has to do with genetics, but certain lifestyle factors also play an important role in how our brain ages. So while you can't control your genes, you can take advantage of the latest science to keep your grey cells strong: Get your olive oil Foods high in sugar, unhealthy fats and processed foods -- i.e., the typical American diet -- can wreak havoc on your brain over time. Studies have shown that excess sugar consumption can impair learning and memory, and increase your vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Some scientists have even referred to Alzheimer's as \"Type 3 Diabetes,\" suggesting that diet may have some role in an individual's risk for developing the disease. Advertisement A Mediterranean-based diet, on the other hand, can help protect the brain from signs of aging and ward off cognitive decline. A recent study showed that following this type of diet -- which is a good source of brain-healthy nutrients and includes a lot of fish, healthy fats, whole grains and vegetables -- could slash Alzheimer's risk by up to 50 percent . Location, location, location! Living in a smoggy city might be bad news for your brain. According to research published this earlier this year in the journal Stroke , exposure to air pollution is linked with premature aging of the brain. Advertisement The researchers found that people who lived closer to a major highway had greater markers of pollution in their lungs and blood, which increased their risk for a form of brain damage known as \"silent strokes,\" or symptomless strokes. Increased pollution volume was also linked to decreased brain volume -- a major sign of aging. Nix happy hour Don Draper's daily cigarettes and two-martini lunches might seem glamorous on \"Mad Men,\" but research suggests that they're a fast track to neurodegeneration. Advertisement It should come as no surprise that excessive drinking and cigarette smoking at any stage of life can have a negative effect on the brain, damaging brain tissue and leading to cognitive impairment. Alcoholism can cause or accelerate aging of the brain. But just a couple of glasses of wine a night could pose a risk to brain health, even though there are some cardiovascular benefits. A 2012 Rutgers University study found that moderate to binge drinking -- drinking relatively lightly during the week and then more on the weekends -- can decrease adult brain cell production by 40 percent. \"In the short term there may not be any noticeable motor skills or overall functioning problems, but in the long term this type of behavior could have an adverse effect on learning and memory,\" one of the study's authors, Rutgers neuroscience graduate student Megan Anderson, said in a statement . Advertisement Take a chill pill Living a stressful lifestyle may be the worst thing you can do for your health as you age. Chronic stress is known to shorten the length of telomeres, the sequences at the end of DNA strands that help determine how fast (or slow) the cells in our body age. By shortening telomeres, stress can accelerate the onset of age-related health problems. What about the brain? Well, some research has suggested that high levels of stress hormones can increase an individual's risk for age-related brain damage. Advertisement \"Over the course of a lifetime, the effects of chronic stress can accumulate and become a risk factor for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease,\" Howard Fillit, a clinical professor of geriatric medicine at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine, wrote in Psychology Today . \"Several studies have shown that stress, and particularly one's individual way of reacting to stress (the propensity to become 'dis-stressed' often found in neurotic people for example), increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease.\" If you're feeling stressed out, try picking up a meditation practice. Research has shown that meditation is effective in lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol and protecting the brain from aging . Advertisement Get 8 hours There are a number of scary health effects associated with sleep deprivation, from a higher risk of stroke and diabetes to impaired cognitive functioning. Over the years, losing shut-eye can also accelerate brain aging. In a study conducted last year , researchers from Singapore found that the less that older adults slept, the faster their brains aged. The study's lead author explained in a statement that among older adults, \"sleeping less will increase the rate their brain ages and speed up the decline in their cognitive functions.\" Advertisement Stand up It's a well-established fact that sitting for long periods is terrible for your health. A growing body of research has linked a sedentary lifestyle with health risks including heart disease, diabetes, cancer and early death, even among people who get the recommended daily amount of exercise. And it turns out that sitting is also pretty bad for your brain. Research has linked physical inactivity with cognitive decline. Moreover, weight gain in older adults -- which may result from too much sitting -- has been linked with shrinkage in brain areas associated with memory. So when in doubt, move around. Physical activity has been linked with a number of brain health benefits, including improved learning and memory. Advertisement Use it or lose! If you want to keep your brain sharp, keep it engaged . It doesn't have to be a challenging intellectual task or a brain-training game, either -- simply engaging in everyday activities like reading, cooking or having a conversation (as opposed to vegging out in front of the TV or computer) can make a difference. But mental exercises like crossword puzzles and sudoku can help, too. A 2013 study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that brain exercises are more effective than drugs in preventing cognitive decline. Advertisement The bottom line? Doing new and novel things promotes neurogenesis , the creation of new neurons in the brain. So get outside, learn, discover and try something new to keep your brain sharp through the decades. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Extensive Coral Reef Found Hidden At The Mouth Of The Amazon River But it may be in serious danger. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 23, 2016, 01:27 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Researchers have discovered a massive coral reef in the muddy waters of the Amazon River. The international team made the discovery on a 2012 expedition to the Amazon plume , where the river\u2019s fresh water empties into the Atlantic Ocean near northeastern Brazil, but their findings were published Thursday in the journal Science Advances. Sponge collected during the 2012 expedition. University of Georgia The primary goal of the trip was to research how the plume influences the way that the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide, University of Georgia oceanography and climate change professor Patricia Yager told The Atlantic. Advertisement But one scientist on the team, reef ecologist Rodrigo Moura, had other ideas. \u201cHe pulls out this paper from 1977, saying these researchers had managed to catch a few fish that would indicate reefs are there. He said, \u2018Let\u2019s see if we can find these,\u2019\u201d Yager told the outlet. Moura\u2019s instincts were correct. The researchers used sonar to figure out which areas they wanted to investigate more closely, then dredged up samples from the ocean floor. They believe the reef, which lies between 164 and 329 feet deep, covers about 5,900 square miles. The instincts of Rodrigo Moura that such a reef existed were spot on. University of Georgia Advertisement \"We brought up the most amazing and colorful animals I had ever seen on an expedition,\" Yager said in a University of Georgia statement. Those animals included sea fans, brightly colored-fish, yellow and red sponges and pink coral-like crusted algae, National Geographic reports. Scientists were surprised to find such a thriving reef in areas with no light and low levels of oxygen. \"We found a reef where the textbooks said there shouldn't be one,\u201d study co-author Fabiano Thompson told National Geographic. Advertisement The published study explores the relationship between the river movement and the reef, and how the reef transforms from one location to the next. \u201cIn the far south, it gets more light exposure, so many of the animals are more typical reef corals and things that photosynthesize for food,\u201d Yager said. \u201cBut as you move north, many of those become less abundant, and the reef transitions to sponges and other reef builders that are likely growing on the food that the river plume delivers. So the two systems are intricately linked.\" Researchers have gathered more samples of the reef\u2019s inhabitants since 2012, including brittle and basket stars, huge sponges and 73 different species of fish. However, the strong currents and muddy water have prevented researchers from diving down to see the reef firsthand.

However, the Amazon reef may also be in danger, particularly from industrial oil exploration. The Brazilian government has sold a significant amount of land to companies for oil exploration, some of which encompasses the reef.

So That's Why Our Eyes Dart Around As We Sleep New sleep study confirms that we see things similarly to when we're awake. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 13, 2015, 08:27 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The new research suggests that during dreams, our eyes and brains respond similarly to how they react to images when we\u2019re awake. Radius Images Scientists have long known that when we enter the phase of sleep in which dreams occur, our eyes dart about rapidly. But what exactly are eyes doing when we experience rapid eye movement (REM) sleep? A new study suggests that our eyes are essentially visualizing new images that we \"see\" in our dreams. In fact, our eyes seem to respond to those images in much the same way they would respond to seeing something while awake. Advertisement \"Our goal was to examine what happens inside the brain when we dream , specifically at moments when rapid eye movements occur,\" Dr. Yuval Nir, a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel and co-author of the study, said in a written statement. \"We discovered that the electrical brain activity during REM sleep is very similar to what occurs when the viewer sees new images for the first time.\" For the study, the brain activity of 19 epilepsy patients whose brains had been fitted with electrodes was monitored for two weeks -- both while the patients were awake and while they were asleep. The researchers observed that neurons in the medial temporal lobe -- a brain region associated with visual perception and memory -- showed a surge of activity around a quarter of a second after patients moved their eyes during REM sleep, New Scientist reported. The researchers concluded that after the rapid eye movements occur the dreaming brain produces new images. Advertisement \"Even people who are congenitally blind... can still dream about their aunt coming to visit from Florida: her voice, the emotions and all the associations that go with that,\" Nir told BBC News. \"And when the dream changes from meeting this aunt to, say, taking your dog for a stroll in the park, then the brain activity changes and this happens in sync with eye movements .\" The scientists hope that, with additional research, they might be able to link brain activity in dreaming patients to specific dream imagery. The study was published online in the journal Nature Communications on August 11, 2015. Why do we dream? Check out the \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" video below to learn more about the elusive world of dreaming.

Light Round The Clock Speeds Up Aging In Mice The implications for city-dwelling humans aren't great either. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jul 14, 2016, 04:31 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Tetra Images via Getty Images If you are one of the millions of people living in cities so luminous that the night sky never turns dark , you might want to run home, shut the curtains and turn off the lights. Researchers have found that mice exposed to artificial light around the clock suffer a range of health consequences, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. Advertisement The light-bombarded mice showed inflammation, muscle weakness and bone loss. In other words, the classic signs of frailty, which is typically a normal part of aging in people and animals\u2014except that the mice in the study were not old. Most of us do not live under uninterrupted light for six months like these mice did, but the findings highlight the consequences of meddling with the natural day-night cycle. \u201cWe used to think of light and darkness as harmless or neutral stimuli with respect to health,\u201d study co-author Johanna Meijer, of the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said in a statement . But growing evidence from laboratories all over the world suggests the opposite, she added. Advertisement \u201cPossibly this is not surprising as life evolved under the constant pressure of the light-dark cycle,\u201d Meijer said. \u201cWe seem to be optimized to live under these cycles, and the other side of the coin is that we are now affected by a lack of such cycles.\u201d A Light-Powered Clock In The Brain The premature aging in the mice can likely be traced to the nighttime light\u2019s harmful effect on their brains\u2019 circadian clock, according to the researchers. After living for six months in brightly lit cages, the animals showed a 70 percent reduction of the normal rhythmic patterns in their brains\u2019 central clock, a tiny group of 20,000 neurons in the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Advertisement Guided by the information from light-sensitive cells in the eyes, the SCN controls daily hormonal activities in the body over a 24-hour cycle. In the case of the mice, the SCN constantly received signals from those light-sensitive cells for six months. (Even with the eyes closed during sleep, a portion of the light still reaches the cells on the retina.) Though mice are not people, a host of other studies suggest that light has similar effects on our own circadian clock : Too much exposure to artificial light breaks our natural sleep patterns. This in turn leads to health problems ranging from mood disorders to diabetes. Shift workers, for example, have an increased risk for heart disease . Sleep-deprived people may gain weight because their brains respond differently to high-calorie food. People with disrupted rest due to sleep apnea show poor bone health . Turn The Darkness Back On As for the darkness-deprived mice, they exhibited less strength and lower skeletal muscle function in standard tests. Their bone density decreased, and they showed signs of an activated immune system. Advertisement The good news, researchers said, was that those effects were reversible. Two week after the mice were returned to a normal light-dark cycle, their SCN neurons got back in normal rhythm, and their health problems improved. A map of light pollution in North America, recently released in the journal Science, reveals areas where the glow from artificial lighting obscures the stars and the night sky never truly goes dark. Falchi, et al., Science Advances; Jakob Grothe/National Park Service, Matthew Price/Cires/CU-Boulder People don\u2019t need to be part of a study to experience a disturbed day-night cycle. Up to 80 percent of the world\u2019s population lives under artificial light during the night. Light pollution may grow even more as energy-efficient but high-intensity LED streetlights replace traditional street lamps, a Science research article noted last month. Advertisement Recently the American Medical Association also warned against the health effects of LED streetlights . Rich in blue light , LEDs may have up to five times greater impact on circadian rhythms than conventional street lamps, according to the AMA. The medical group pointed out that b righter residential nighttime lighting is linked with reduced sleep, low sleep quality, sleepiness, impaired daytime functioning and obesity. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Say Hello To One Of Our Neighbors, Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy This elusive galaxy sits only 280,000 light-years from Earth. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Sep 21, 2015, 08:48 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Astronomers at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) are taking a new, up-close look at one of our most elusive neighbors: the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy . Located some 280,000 light-years from Earth in the Sculptor constellation , the dwarf galaxy can easily be mistaken for a simple cloud of faint stars. But on Sept. 16, the ESO released a new moving image (above) of the dwarf galaxy, showing its ghostly stars in all of their glory. Advertisement The image was taken by the 2.2-meter telescope at ESO\u2019s La Silla Observatory in Chile. The Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy was first spotted in the late 1930s by American astronomer Harlow Shapley (1885-1972). It's home to ancient stars that have remarkably similar chemical make-up to the oldest stars in our Milky Way. Now astronomers are hoping to examine the dwarf galaxy's stars to learn more about the earliest periods of star formation.

How The Bacteria In Your Gut Could Be Used To Treat Mental Illness New research finds that altering gut bacteria in mice changes the way their brains work. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Apr 23, 2016, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scimat Scimat via Getty Images The trillions of bacteria living in the human gut influence how our brain functions, our mood and behavior. Scientists have linked imbalances in this community of microbes to a range of psychiatric conditions, including depression , anxiety disorders , autism , schizophrenia , obsessive-compulsive disorder , social anxiety and neuroticism ... and the list goes on. Now, medical researchers are turning their attention to finding ways to use the gut's microbiome to actually treat those illnesses. Advertisement New research from scientists with New York City's Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, published Wednesday in the journal eLife , suggests that altering the gut bacteria in a sick person might help alleviate psychiatric conditions, as well as certain diseases that attack myelin in the human body. Myelin forms the protective layer around the axons of nerve cells that increases the speed at which the cell sends electrical impulses. When the myelin sheath is damaged, neural communication is impaired, resulting in neurological and behavioral markers of mental illness. The study showed that when gut bacteria from depressed mice was transferred into healthy mice, there were changes to the myelin sheath in the brains of the healthy mice.

MS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by myelin damage, and depression is common among its patients. Clinicians might be able to improve the functioning of the myelin layer and reduce those depressive symptoms by altering the patients' gut bacteria, the researchers noted. \"The study provides a proof of principle that gut metabolites have the ability to affect myelin content irrespective of the genetic makeup of mice,\" Dr. Patrizia Casaccia, a professor of neuroscience, genetics and genomics, and neurology at the medical school and the study's lead author, said in a statement . \"We are hopeful these metabolites can be targeted for potential future therapies.\" Advertisement It's an exciting time for microbiome research. At MIT, scientists are hacking gut bacteria to create \"synthetic biotics\" -- microbes programmed to perform specific actions in the gut, like detecting inflammation and creating anti-inflammatory molecules. Like probiotics, these live bacteria could be taken in pill form. \"We're sort of like a walking vessel for these bacteria,\" Dr. Timothy Lu, a biological engineer at MIT who is spearheading the synthetic biotics research, recently told The Huffington Post. \"There's a symbiotic relationship between the two sides, human and bacteria.\" How exactly do microbes colonize and control the human body?

Elon Musk Sends Electric Car Into Space Aboard World's Most Powerful Rocket SpaceX's successful maiden flight of its Falcon Heavy rocket puts humans one step closer to Mars. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 6, 2018, 04:10 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT WASHINGTON \u2014 SpaceX made history Tuesday afternoon when it successfully launched its new Falcon Heavy rocket carrying an electric car bound for deep space and returned two of three 15-story boosters back to Earth for perfect vertical landings. The initial test launch of what is now the world\u2019s most powerful operational rocket marks the latest milestone in billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s quest to send humans to Mars and eventually colonize the red planet. Advertisement The Falcon Heavy consists of three Falcon 9 rockets, which SpaceX has been using for years to deploy satellites and run resupply missions to the International Space Station. With 27 engines, Falcon Heavy gives off more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff \u2014 equivalent to 18 Boeing 747 aircraft \u2014 and is capable lifting 140,000 pounds into orbit. That\u2019s equivalent to a fully loaded 737 aircraft. Liftoff! pic.twitter.com/2ypESsi1sF \u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) February 6, 2018 That Tuesday\u2019s launch at 3:45 p.m. from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida went off without a hitch is remarkable. Advertisement \u201cThis is a test mission,\u201d Musk told The New York Times ahead of liftoff. \u201cThere is so much that can go wrong.\u201d In an interview with CNN , Musk warned that spectators could expect either \u201ca great rocket launch or the best fireworks display they\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The payload on the inaugural test flight was, rather appropriately, a product of Musk\u2019s other brainchild, Tesla. The electric car, a red convertible Roadster, is slated to be deployed six hours after liftoff. If all goes well, it and a dummy driver named \u201cStarman\u201d will be sent into orbit around the sun. They will reach a speed of 7 miles per second and travel approximately 250 million miles from Earth, eventually passing close by the red planet. Advertisement View from SpaceX Launch Control. Apparently, there is a car in orbit around Earth. pic.twitter.com/QljN2VnL1O \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 6, 2018 The car could remain in orbit for a billion years. And there\u2019s an \u201cextremely tiny\u201d chance that it could crash into Mars, Musk told The New York Times. \u201cThat was awesome,\u201d a SpaceX commentator said roughly five minutes into the launch. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can really say.\u201d Advertisement A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Feb 4, 2018 at 9:50pm PST Along with a successful maiden launch, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. , or SpaceX, managed to recover two of its boosters. Both were used during previous flights in 2016 and landed simultaneously on land at Cape Canaveral.

But instead of capturing a successful landing, the onboard camera appeared to show smoke before cutting out entirely. More than 45 minutes after the launch, SpaceX had not provided an update on the fate of the center booster. Flight profile #FalconHeavy #SpaceX pic.twitter.com/LlfWXqUaLP \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 6, 2018 In late 2015, the company sent shockwaves through the space community when it landed a booster back on Earth \u2014 the first ever successful attempt to recover a rocket from an orbital flight. At the time a SpaceX commentator compared the feat to \u201claunching a pencil over the Empire State Building, having it reverse, come back down, and land on a shoebox on the ground during a windstorm.\u201d Advertisement Less than a year later, after four failed attempts to land a Falcon 9 on floating platforms in the Atlantic, SpaceX nailed a seemingly impossible at-sea landing aboard a drone ship named \u201cOf Course I Still Love You.\u201d SpaceX is developing rockets that can be reused in an effort to make space flight cheaper and easier. While it costs between $200,000 to $300,000 to refill the rocket, the rocket itself costs $60 million , Musk has said. Advertisement The effort has come with many setbacks. In September 2016, for example, a Falcon 9 burst into flames on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Musk called it \u201c the most difficult and complex failure \u201d the company has had in its 14-year history. In 2016, Musk unveiled plans to make humans a \u201cmulti-planet species.\u201d He hopes to eventually build a self-sustainable Martian colony of 1 million people by building a massive \u201cInterplanetary Transport System.\u201d Like something out of a science fiction film, giant spaceships would shuttle upward of 100 people \u2015 perhaps many more in the future \u2015 plus luggage and other cargo to and from the red planet. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Geckos Caught Playing For The First Time Ever, Scientists Say -- And It All Went Down In Space Geckos Have A Blast During Space Mission By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 22, 2015, 02:23 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Geckos aren't exactly known for their playful nature. Like most reptiles, they're not really known to play at all, which is why scientists believe this video from a 2013 space mission captures something very unusual. It's geckos... at play. The space geckos were sent into orbit in the Bion-M No. 1 satellite , an unmanned Russian spacecraft loaded with animal experiments. Early in the mission, one of the 15 female thick-toed geckos on board lost her collar, which floated around the geckos' pod once they were in orbit. Advertisement The geckos didn't float, thanks to their sticky toe pads. And as The Guardian reports, they first tried to avoid the floating collar, perhaps out of fear . Over time, however, the geckos started to play with it. The researchers wrote in the Journal of Ethology: Four of the five geckos participated in play episodes , which were defined as one-time interactions with the collar, as well in a fuller form of play that included approaching the unmoving collar or observing its approach, manipulations with the collar and further tracking the collar. Manipulations with the collar could take the form of complicated play, such as pressing the snout against the edge of the collar rim, multiple episodes of pushing the collar with the snout, inserting the head into the collar, holding the collar by pressing the head to the container floor and tilting the head with the collar on the snout. Unlike the \" sex geckos \" that were killed during a space mission last year , the playful geckos were safely returned to earth -- and researchers have been analyzing information from the mission ever since, including the video that captured them at play. \"It's the first demonstration of object play in geckos \u2013- something that is rare in any lizard ,\" herpetologist Gordon Burghardt at the University of Tennessee, who was not involved in the study, told New Scientist. As the authors of the study point out, capturing any reptile at all in the act of play is extremely rare. Advertisement \u201cReptiles have quite a complex brain structure and rather well developed cognitive and perceptual abilities, but until recently they were considered unable to demonstrate play behavior,\" the authors wrote. \"Even now, play behavior has been described in sufficient detail and proven in only a few species of reptiles.\" Those species include the American alligator, Nile soft-shelled turtle and monitor lizard. But until now, scientists have had a hard time proving that geckos can play. The Animal Answer Guide from Johns Hopkins University Press has a FAQ on geckos that includes the question, \"Do geckos play?\" The answer: \" Probably not, but it's hard to know .\" The guide says: Geckos explore their environment and may be \u201ccurious\u201d about unfamiliar objects or organisms. However, most of this curiosity is almost certainly related to basic life functions. In other words, geckos want to know things like 'Can I eat it?' 'Will it try to eat me?' or 'Can I mate with it?' Or, in the case of inanimate objects 'Can it help or hinder me from eating, mating, or hiding?' While people might think a pet gecko is playing, \"other more practical explanations probably apply,\" the guide says.

Space Lawyers Are A Thing, And We Talked To One About The Future Of Cosmic Mining Dr. Frans von der Dunk weighs in on the space bill that just passed Congress and what exactly being a \"space lawyer\" entails. By Lila Shapiro Senior Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post Nov 19, 2015, 01:13 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Universal History Archive via Getty Images Humanity is now one step closer to the kind of disastrous extraterrestrial mining operation depicted by James Cameron in Avatar. Incidentally, Cameron is one of the Americans who stands to benefit by a new bill that sailed through Congress this week. The U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act would allow private companies to own a piece of space. More specifically, the bill, which now goes to President Barack Obama to sign, will allow companies to own any resources they mine from an asteroid or moon. Advertisement The financial gains stand to be huge - one large asteroid that passed by Earth this summer was estimated to be worth more than the entire economy of Japan. (The platinum core at that astroid\u2019s center alone was valued at more than $5 trillion dollars .) This potential explains why people like Cameron, along with Ross Perot Jr., Larry Page and Google's Eric Schmidt, have invested in Planetary Resources Inc., a company that is drawing up plans to mine astroids and building the necessary technology to do it. (The company has already launched a test vehicle into orbit.) Planetary Resources says that its mining operation won't just pay dividends to investors, but will also aid further planetary exploration, supplying rocket fuel and water to astronauts and space tourists. Advertisement \u201cMany years from now, we will view this pivotal moment in time as a major step toward humanity becoming a multi-planetary species,\u201d Planetary Resources co-founder Eric Anderson declared in a press release after the bill passed through the Senate. But not all industry observers are thrilled by the proposed law. Some space lawyers (yes, that's a thing) argue that the bill would violate the Outer Space Treaty. A number of countries including the United States and Russia have signed the document, which states that nations can\u2019t own territories in space. Others warn that the the bill leaves out key details necessary for establishing a regulatory structure for the industry. I spoke with Dr. Frans von der Dunk, a professor of space law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, to ask about the intricacies of the new bill, the future of space mining, and how someone becomes a space lawyer, anyway. This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Advertisement Is it currently legal for private companies to mine astroids? Unfortunately, the current status of international law, notably the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (which was drafted when nobody seriously thought this could happen), leaves some room for doubt. Those who are for various reasons not positively inclined to commercial exploitation of outer space use this to argue that it is not legal. In my view, however, it is legal as long as somehow authorized and supervised by the relevant country, in this case the United States. The bill thus is a first step towards such regulation; it already provides that those going into outer space to mine, as long as in conformity with international law, would actually be entitled to property rights over resources once harvested. One issue with the Outer Space Treaty (the only really relevant international document here) was that it had only declared outer space to be non-appropriable by states, essentially like the high seas. Some draw the conclusion from this that you then need an international regime and international permission under such a regime to actually start mining, but the comparison with the high seas for me means that you can certainly, in principle, extract mineral resources. After all, the lack of territorial sovereignty of any country over the high seas has prevented nobody from actually fishing out there. Advertisement I know that some industry observers have been critical of the bill that just passed Congress. Where do you stand on it and why? As long as one realizes that this is a first step, I think it is a careful and balanced step towards allowing bona fide commercial companies to start investigating and investing in such ventures. This should also be seen as an invitation to the international community to consider following this unilateral, national initiative and work towards a more globally applicable legal regime, presumably along the same lines. Do you see any possible unanticipated consequences if this bill does become law? The world is full of surprises, which is certainly also true for outer space and space activities. But as this bill is a mere first step, it should be flexible enough to accommodate unexpected developments in the course of the expected research, investigation and planning stages, which of necessity will have to precede actual exploitation. Advertisement Only once actual exploitation would rapidly come closer do we on the one hand need to establish more detailed laws and regulations, and do we on the other hand also perhaps actually know enough to do so. How close do you think we are to the time when private companies will be landing on astroids and drilling? Is all the technology in place already? From what I understood -- I am merely a lawyer -- it would probably be between 10 and 20 years or so before we\u2019d see the first actual drilling going on. The first phase is clearly reconnoitering and analyzing, first from earth, then, once a few serious candidate asteroids have been singled out, up close by robotic missions probably not even yet landing. The techniques for such first-phase missions are certainly there, those for the close-up analysis probably also, but actual mining is a different ballgame. If we see how much difficulty the multiple-nation European Space Agency had in safely landing a robotic probe on the P-67 comet, that makes one pause -- although on the other hand, a near-earth asteroid would seem to be a much easier target. Advertisement What do you think the true monetary value of space mining is? Is it really a cost-effective technique, in your opinion? Or are companies drawn in for the wow factor more than financial gain? I don\u2019t think companies are in it only for the wow factor. Although the angel investors certainly display an amount of idealism and adventurism (just picture the likes of Richard Branson and Elon Musk) they also see a serious chance for business, even if long-term. (And even if they may turn out to be very wrong, too.) I cannot give you any dollar figures, and much of that has yet to be sorted out. (Although I also suspect the two companies closest to going there, Planetary Resources and Deep Space, may have done some market studies which are commercially confidential). But I remember that Apollo 17 astronaut Jack Schmitt made a fervent plea for harvesting Helium-3 on the Moon, 24 tons of which supposedly could fuel the entire United States for a year. Advertisement There are generically three scenarios at play here. One, the actual use of harvested resources will also be in outer space, e.g. the use of water for rocket fuel for further missions or human habitats on Mars. The cost of hauling anything in outer space is still so immense that being able to refuel in outer space may well present a very interesting business case. Two, the use of the harvested resources will physically take place in outer space, but through some technique or other result in the generation of energy/electricity down on earth. (I have no clue whether that is scientifically feasible, but have seen this several times being suggested.) Three, one actually takes extremely valuable minerals or other resources back to earth, allowing perhaps also to substitute for terrestrial mining, or to be added to minimal existing terrestrial deposits. How did you get into space law? And how has the field changed since you first entered it? Somewhat by accident, actually. I was working as a young assistant with a professor of international law at Leiden University when a position as co-director of space law became available. At the time -- with some exaggeration -- space law was a rather embryonic field, mainly consisting of some international treaties of general or particular scope plus a bit of institutions. Advertisement Since then, however, major paradigm changes occurred and I was allowed to grow with the discipline. Most importantly, outer space moved from being a superpower-dominated domain largely used for military and related purposes to a multifaceted domain with many, by now indispensable, civil, social, economic and commercial implications and angles, drawing numerous smaller states as well as leading developing countries into the game, plus an ever increasing array of private entrepreneurs in increasingly diverse fields of space, space services and space applications. I just finished a Handbook on Space Law (with the help of 11 co-authors) which runs well over a 1,000 pages. The alumni of our unique LLM program in space, cyber and telecommunications law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are getting jobs all over the field as a consequence.

Hubble Captures Breathtaking Portrait Of Blue Bubble In Space The stunning nebula lies about 8,000 light-years away. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Apr 21, 2016, 11:12 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A spectacular new view of the Bubble Nebula to celebrate Hubble's 26th year in space. NASA, ESA, Hubble Heritage Team There's no bursting this bubble. The folks at the Hubble Space Telescope have released magnificent images of a \"gigantic cosmic soap bubble\" to celebrate Hubble's 26th anniversary in space . Named the Bubble Nebula, also known as NGC 7635, this interstellar cloud of gas and dust was first discovered in 1787, but the object is so big that previously it could only be photographed in sections. The new image (seen above) is a mosaic of four images taken by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. Advertisement On April 24, 1990, the space shuttle Discovery lifted off from Earth along with the Hubble Space Telescope. Each year, Hubble releases a new spectacular image to commemorate the anniversary of its launch. The star at the center of the nebula , which gives off a glowing effect, is between ten and twenty times the mass of the Sun. The nebula\u2019s bubble-like form is a result of strong stellar winds pushing gas and dust into a spherical shape. Advertisement To show how far the technology has progressed, NASA/ESA resurfaced an image from 1998 showing the Bubble Nebula. The Bubble Nebula, seen in 1998.

Bizarre Mars Dune Pattern Looks Like A Message In Morse Code Klaatu barada nikto? By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 11, 2016, 11:30 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A newly released NASA image of Mars shows natural patterns on the Red Planet that look a lot like Morse code. \u201c These dunes are influenced by local topography ,\u201d the space agency said in a news release. \u201cThe shape and orientation of dunes can usually tell us about wind direction, but in this image, the dune-forms are very complex, so it\u2019s difficult to know the wind direction.\u201d Advertisement As can be seen in the image, the pattern sits inside a large circular depression : NASA/JPL/University of Arizona NASA said the depression is likely an old and infilled impact crater, which limits the sand available for the wind to form dunes. \u201cThe \u2018dashes\u2019 are linear dunes formed by bi-directional winds, which are not traveling parallel to the dune. Instead, the combined effect of winds from two directions at right angles to the dunes, funnels material into a linear shape. The smaller \u2018dots\u2019 (called \u2018barchanoid dunes\u2019) occur where there is some interruption to the process forming those linear dunes. This process is not well understood at present and is one motivation for HiRISE to image this area.\u201d Here\u2019s a closer look at some of the \u201ccode\u201d in the image: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona The photo was snapped in February by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter . So what does it say? NASA planetary scientist Veronica Bray translated it for Gizmodo : NEE NED ZB 6TNN DEIBEDH SIEFI EBEEE SSIEI ESEE SEEE !! Ok then. That\u2019s it.

In The Future We May All Talk Like Trump, Linguist Warns. Sad. Constant repetitions are worming their way into the circuitry of our brains. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jan 22, 2018, 04:32 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Reuters/Carlo Allegri President Donald Trump is colonizing our brains with his drumbeat of repetitive words and phrases, an American linguist warns. According to George Lakoff , an emeritus professor of cognitive science and linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, constant repetitions actually create physical changes in our brains by forging stronger connections in our neural pathways, Advertisement \u201cLanguage activates an idea and a circuitry in your brain. Every time a circuit is activated, its synapses get stronger ,\u201d Lakoff told Deutsche-Welle in an interview published Sunday. In other words, the more you hear things \u2014 and say things \u2014 the stronger the circuitry becomes. Plus, the absorbed words can begin to reframe our perception of the world. Lakoff pointed to President George W. Bush\u2019s constant use of \u201ctax relief,\u201d which essentially defines taxes as an affliction. Soon Democrats and the media were also using the phrase, and in essence, changed their perception of reality. Even if you disagree with an idea and contradict it, the words still worm their way into your head. \u201cEvery time you deny something overtly using the language of the person you are trying to contradict, you are actually helping that person,\u201d Lakoff said. Advertisement Besides repetitions of his pet phrases, Trump also uses other language-distorting strategies in his tweets. He frames situations in his own terms. He diverts attention from issues he wants to be ignored. He attacks the messenger or blames someone. Finally, he launches a trial balloon by saying something outrageous. What to do? \u201cYou are not puppets,\u201d Lakoff said. \u201cCut the strings.\u201d Don\u2019t use the same language Trump uses. \u201cUse the language that conveys the truth,\u201d Lakoff added.

How To Watch The Quadrantid Meteor Shower, The First Shooting Star Show Of 2015 Catch The Year's Very First Meteor Shower This Weekend Dominique Mosbergen Jan 2, 2015, 12:29 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Skywatchers in the Northern Hemisphere can celebrate the start of 2015 with the year\u2019s very first meteor shower , set to peak this weekend. The Quadrantid meteor shower , always the first of the year, is expected to peak on the night of Saturday, Jan. 3, at 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT). The best viewing hours in the Northern Hemisphere will be between midnight and dawn local time on Sunday, Jan. 4.

This year, the Quadrantids may also be particularly difficult to catch due to an almost-full moon . Still, NASA estimates the meteor shower will boast about 80 meteors an hour at its peak. Those in parts of Europe and Asia should have the best chance of catching a glimpse of the Quadrantids this year. Stargazers are encouraged to find a viewing area away from city lights and streetlights, and to look east. Advertisement For those who can't make it outside to catch the meteor shower in person, the Slooh Space Camera will provide a live broadcast of the meteor shower online starting at 11 p.m. EST on Jan.4.
