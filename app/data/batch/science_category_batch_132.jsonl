Hubble Captures Stunning Image Of Blue 'Bubble' In Deep Space The gas cloud circles a star some 30,000 light-years from Earth. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 28, 2016, 05:15 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Behold this cosmic blue bubble. The stunning celestial sight was recently captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Circling the Wolf-Rayet star known as WR 31a , which is located in the constellation of Carina some 30,000 light-years from Earth, it's actually an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other gases. Scientists think the nebula formed when stellar winds interacted with outer layers of hydrogen ejected by the star. Advertisement The Hubble Space Telescope's website says the bubble is currently expanding outwards at around 136,700 miles per hour. But Wolf-Rayet stars only have a life cycle of a few hundred thousand years, \"the blink of an eye in cosmic terms,\" the site said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Can We Replace Misleading Terms Like 'Mental Illness,' 'Patient,' and 'Schizophrenia' I don't trust clinicians who restrict themselves to reductionistic diagnostic interviews, but I also don't trust clinicians who can't make an accurate diagnosis. Diagnosis and empathy are necessary partners in any therapeutic relationship, fully complementary and in no way incompatible. By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Apr 5, 2015, 04:50 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

The question is, said Alice, whether you can make words mean so many different things. The question is, said Humpty Dumpty, which is to be master - that's all.\" -- Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass You may recall that Humpty's complacent confidence in the power and precision of his words just preceded his very great fall -- and all the king's horses and all the king\"s men could not repair the damage done. Those of us who worked on DSM IV learned first-hand and painfully the limitations of the written word and how it can be tortured and twisted in damaging daily usage, especially when there is a profit to be had. Advertisement The DSM IV was intended to be a very conservative document -- we rejected all but two of 94 suggested new diagnoses. We also field tested carefully to ensure there would not be dramatic and unexpected impacts on rates. This did not stop the widespread misuse of the terms Attention Deficit Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, Paraphilia and others. The lesson: If some wording in DSM can possibly be misused for any purpose, it almost certainly will be. We made Humpty's fundamental error, believing it possible to remain master of our words and to control their usage by, and connotations for, others. Words tend to take on a life of their own, often enough becoming ambiguous and misleading in the process. And once an incorrect usage acquires the tenure of long and wide acceptance, it can be very difficult to control or to replace. Advertisement This brings us to some of my least favorite words that paradoxically I find myself unavoidably using a lot -- \"mental illness,\" \"severely mentally ill,\" \"patient,\" \"schizophrenia.\" Bad as they are, I haven't ever been able to come up with better replacements. \"Mental illness\" is terribly misleading because the \"mental disorders\" we diagnose are no more than descriptions of what clinicians observe people do or say, not at all well established diseases. For example, the term \"schizophrenia\" just describes a heterogeneous set of experiences and behaviors; it doesn't at all explain them and eventually there will be hundreds of different causes and dozens of different treatments. \"Schizophrenia\" is certainly is not one illness. The \"mental illness\" term also lends itself to a simple-minded biological reductionism that pays insufficient attention to the psychological and social factors that are crucial in understanding anyone's problems. Everyone complains about \"mental illness,\" but nobody has come up with a better substitute. Advertisement The terms \"severely mentally ill\" or its alternate, \"seriously mentally ill\" are not only awkward tongue twisters to say, but also misleading in the same way and potentially stigmatizing. They may be taken to mean that the person so labeled is destined to a bad outcome and/or that medication will be not only necessary in the treatment, but also sufficient. But these terms also have no easy replacement and one or the other is necessary because without some clearly recognizable designation, this shamefully neglected group would be even more ignored and shamefully neglected. \"Patient\" has come to imply participation in a hierarchical relationship that brings with it little responsibility for shared decision making. It is a mistake when doctors make unilateral decisions for their patients, because peoples' needs, tastes, and wishes vary so much and there is usually such uncertainty about which treatments from a menu of plausible options might best suit that particular person. But I have also never been comfortable with cold, market-sounding terms like \"client,\" \"consumer,\" \"customer\" or \"service user.\" These are business terms and lack the connotation of caring and responsibility associated with helping a \"patient.\" And surveys show that many \"patients\" actually prefer to be called \"patients.\" Advertisement Unless someone comes up with a better term, I think it would be better to rehabilitate the connotation of \"patient\" rather than replace it, making clear that it implies full partnership in a therapeutic relationship. Anne Cooke. Ph.D is also interested in the power of words. She led a project \"Understanding Psychosis\" on behalf of the British Psychological Society Division of Clinical Psychology. She and I have debated its pros and cons on another post . Dr. Cooke writes: \" The language we use is important not so much in its own right but because it reflects -- and also shapes -- the way we think about things: our 'guiding ideas.' As you rightly point out, Allen, calling certain emotional states, or ways of thinking and acting 'mental illnesses' is just one way of thinking about them, rather than the only way. All we really know is that people sometimes feel or act in certain ways: the rest is our interpretation. Advertisement If I feel sad and hopeless, and stay in bed all day staring at the ceiling, I am likely to be diagnosed with depression. I may be told that I have an illness, and this way of understanding my situation does have its advantages. For example, I can go to my family doctor and hopefully find a sympathetic ear, maybe some tablets to take the edge off things and perhaps be referred on to someone I can talk to. If I'm feeling so bad that I can't work, I can take time off sick and even claim benefits. So the idea of mental illness definitely has its plus sides: it gives us a way of talking about difficult things and a framework for offering help. However, I often wonder whether overall, the whole enterprise of finding medical labels and drug \"treatments\" for what are often arguably problems of living, actually causes more problems than it solves. To continue the example, thinking of myself as mentally ill might well be a huge blow to my self-confidence. I might conclude that there is little I can do to help myself except to keep taking the tablets. Depending on my diagnosis, I might begin to fear turning into people's image of a mental patient -- strange, unable to function and perhaps even potentially violent. Other people who know that I am 'mentally ill' might be prejudiced and treat me as inferior or even frightening. I would also lose some of the human rights I had always taken for granted: people with 'mental disorders' are the only group that can be locked up without trial and injected with drugs against their will. Advertisement As you say though, Allen, we may be na\u00efve to think that logical argument about language and concepts is likely to change anything. There are so many vested interests at stake on all sides. Individually and as a society we want, or perhaps need, to believe that professionals and technology have the answers. It's also clear that the mental health industry certainly isn't going to argue. The American Psychiatric Association profits very directly from the idea that certain experiences are diagnosable 'illnesses'. It makes millions of dollars every year from its publishing monopoly on DSM. Drug companies profit to the tune of billions, not millions, by conducting misleading marketing campaigns selling the notion that expectable life problems are DSM disorders due to a chemical imbalance and requiring a pill solution. Advertisement I disagree with you, actually -- I think there are alternatives to terms like 'mental illness', even for very severe problems. There is a wonderful thing called everyday English. Why not just use people's own language? That way we enable people to define their own experiences and avoid imposing our own ideas on them. If someone hears voices or appears out of contact with reality, why not just say that? Even if the experiences are severe, long-lasting and disabling, why invoke terms like 'schizophrenia' or 'mental illness' that as soon as we use them, impose a particular interpretation of the situation? This is the approach we took in the British Psychological Society report ' Understanding Psychosis and Schizophrenia .' We deliberately chose not to call the report, say 'The causes and treatment of schizophrenia and other psychoses.' Such a title would have reflected only one possible set of guiding ideas about the phenomena in question, namely a medical one. We even considered not using the terms 'psychosis' or 'schizophrenia' in the title. However, since they are the terms people currently often use, we compromised by using everyday language for the subtitle: 'Why people sometimes hear voices, believe things others find strange, or appear out of reality - and what can help.' We explain our use of language at the beginning: 'There is considerable debate about the most helpful way of referring to the experiences described in this report. The different terms used by different people reflect the more general debate...about the nature and causes of these experiences. Traditionally, experiences such as having extremely suspicious thoughts (paranoia) or hearing voices that no-one else can hear, have been seen as signs of mental illness, for example schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. People who experience them have been referred to as 'patients' or 'sufferers'. Whilst some people find this a helpful way of understanding what is going on, others do not, and many people do not see themselves as having an illness. Indeed, over the past twenty years it has become clear that there are many people in the general population who have these experiences but never need any kind of mental health care....We have attempted to use terms which are as neutral as possible, and which do not imply that there is only one correct way of understanding these experiences'.\" Advertisement Thanks, Anne. We certainly join forces in worrying that loose usage and commercial gain have extended the terminology of mental 'illness' to many expectable problems of everyday living that are much better explained by psychological factors and social context and better described using everyday language. But we part company when you suggest that all diagnostic labels can be easily and safely. Your suggestion would have disastrous consequences for those who have severe psychiatric problems. Advertisement Here's why: An adequate differential diagnosis of delusions and hallucinations requires full consideration of whether the problems are best described as: 'Substance Induced Psychotic Disorder', 'Psychotic Disorder Due To A General Medical Condition', \"Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Schizophrenia', Brief Psychosis', Delusional Disorder', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Catatonia', Obsessive Compulsive Disorder', or 'Sleep Disorder'. Each of this has different implications and calls for different actions. Only when all have been ruled out, can one conclude before that the experiences have no clinical significance and can be described adequately with everyday language. The management of severe psychiatric disorder is often an emergency. Missing a delirium, mania, psychotic depression, or a substance or medical illness etiology can have catastrophic effects The next steps in management differ dramatically depending on which label fits best. Recommending the sacrifice of crucial diagnostic distinctions in favor of everyday language simply won't cut it in dealing with the 'severely ill'.

They can hurt a great deal. They can provide clarity, but they can also badly mislead. The words we use in mental health all carry the heavy baggage of misleading and potentially stigmatizing connotation. They are vastly overused to describe mild problems of everyday life better described with everyday language. But we need diagnostic labels for the 'severely ill' and all suggested replacements are much more harmful than helpful. Afterword from Anne: \"Thanks Allen. If you'll allow me one parting shot, to question the value of diagnostic labels is very different to concluding that someone's experiences have no clinical significance. When people have distressing and disabling experiences, professionals need to help in any way we can. All the more reason to sit down with the person and work out between us what might be contributing to their particular problem and what might help, rather than imposing a framework of understanding, a label and a treatment that the person may not find helpful.\" Advertisement Afterword from me: Making a diagnosis is only one small part of getting to know the 'patient', certainly necessary but very far from sufficient. I don't trust clinicians who restrict themselves to reductionistic diagnostic interviews, but I also don't trust clinicians who can't make an accurate diagnosis. Diagnosis and empathy are necessary partners in any therapeutic relationship, fully complementary and in no way incompatible. Allen Frances is a professor emeritus at Duke University and was the chairman of the DSM-IV task force.

North Atlantic Right Whale, One Of The World's Rarest, Spotted Off South Carolina There are a little more than 500 of these majestic whales left. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jan 18, 2016, 04:39 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT One of the rarest whales in the world has been spotted off the coast of South Carolina for the first time in three years. An endangered North Atlantic right whale nicknamed Chiminea was seen earlier this month swimming near Folly Beach, not far from Charleston: Rare right #whale spotted off Folly Beach https://t.co/PBtnClWnMM {\ud83d\udcf7Sea to Shore Alliance} pic.twitter.com/dbvLQF4Zir \u2014 Kate Redman \u24cb (@DolphinSeeker30) January 17, 2016 Advertisement It was the first confirmed sighting of a right whale off South Carolina in three years , according to the Post and Courier newspaper. Right whales reach lengths of up to 55 feet, which is longer than a school bus, and weigh as much as 140,000 pounds, which is nearly the weight of an empty space shuttle. They got their name because they were slow, stayed close to land and floated after being killed due to high levels of valuable blubber -- making them the \"right\" whale to hunt , according to the World Wide Fund For Nature. Advertisement Centuries of hunting brought them to the brink of extinction, with a population of just 263 whales in 1996 , according to the IUCN Red List. Since then, the whales have started to make a comeback, with 526 individuals photographed in 2014 , according to the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium. That's believed to represent most, if not all, of the whales left. As calving season in their breeding grounds off the Georgia coast gets under way this year, there has already been some good news: Advertisement NOAA report on North Atlantic right whale calves - baby pics are cute no matter how big the baby is...   Our right... Posted by Marine Connection on Thursday, January 14, 2016 More calves have since been spotted, bringing the total to six so far , according to the New England Aquarium Right Whale Research Team. While North Atlantic right whales are no longer hunted, they still face manmade threats. Since they live in the busy waters off the East Coast, they routinely get hit by boats, or get caught in fishing ropes and netting. Advertisement Some 83 percent of the whales have scars from having been caught in fishing gear, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. The Inwater Research Group has more about the North Atlantic right whale here .

A sea slug changed my life A sea slug changed my life By Laura Faye Tenenbaum, Contributor Senior Science Editor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Senior Science Editor at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Jun 26, 2016, 07:01 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. This underwater photo of a sea slug was captured with a close-up lens in Monterrey, Calif., by my first SCUBA instructor, Thomas Chapin circa 1985 . At 8 p.m. after a long day of work in the Houston humidity, Derek Rutavic, manager of the NASA Gulfstream-III that will head back to Greenland this fall, and I were in the back of the plane singing One Direction's \"Drag Me Down\" over the high frequency radio system. It was stifling hot, getting dark and we were tired and hungry. But Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) Principal Investigator Josh Willis and Project Manager Steve Dinardo, too busy to take off their sweaty fire retardant flight suits, were troubleshooting electronics at two racks of computers, and they'd asked Rutavic to get on the headset to find out if the headset noise was interfering with the high radio frequency data signal the ocean science probes were sending back to the plane. Rutavic sat on an empty science probe container, while I lounged on one of the sofas singing along in awe of the amount of hard work this team was putting in. Advertisement We'd been up early, flown multiple test flights, worked through lunch. And all of this after days and days of maintenance, and weather delays, and more hard work after more hard work. Earlier in the day, NASA T-38 supersonic jet pilot Bill Rieke flew mind-bogglingly close to the G-III to photograph the science probe deployment and determine if the technique of launching the probes through a hole in the bottom of the plane would succeed. And yes, it did. But that success merely signaled the OMG team to continue working. And I understood exactly why this team kept going, kept moving, kept pushing on into the evening, regardless of being tired and hot and hungry. I knew exactly why they decided to keep working on the challenge. They chose to push through because they'd found something to care about, and that's always more important than our difficulties and problems. When we focus on what we really care about, we get busy doing something, even in the face of trouble. And that's how science works. L essons from a sea slug I first learned to care about the natural world around me during my junior year in college. I was in an oceanography course and we were studying sea slugs. (Yes, sea slugs.) A sea slug changed my life. Before then, I'd been, like many people, disengaged and uninterested in science. In third grade, someone came to our classroom and told us we could be the first female astronaut, and I remember thinking, \"No, I couldn't, not me.\" Advertisement And now? Even though I have a job at NASA, I still feel like I don't belong in the world of science. I feel more comfortable around athletes and artists than I do with a bunch of Ph.D.s. Maybe it's some poorly defined stereotype that I've somehow bought into or some preconceived notion of how someone who does science is supposed to behave. But those sea slugs taught me that I cared more about the natural world than I cared about the struggle of not fitting in or the challenge of the work. They appeared so delicate, small and defenseless, and I identified with that. They helped me feel connected. Noticing them forced me to wonder what else I'd start to notice if I slowed down enough to pay attention. And that connection to the natural world helped me stay committed to science, even when it was hard, even when there were problems, even when I felt like running away. Sure, scientific experimentation, just like much of real life, includes problems, troubles, obstacles and difficulties almost every day. And while it's true that someone, somewhere has to troubleshoot something every step of the way, we can also be excited about the effort. The OMG team understands that problems and hard work are not the exception, they are the norm. They are part of accomplishment. And it's totally possible to thrive on these difficulties and challenges. Advertisement Look, we could be setting the world on fire right now, not by burning fossil fuels, but by our burning desire to understand our environment. Because the whole point of this experimental mission is to find out how quickly the warmer waters around Greenland are melting the second-largest ice sheet on the planet. It's major; it's dire; it's intense. It's one of the most important issues of our time. And sitting there in the back of that plane made me think about how we, as individuals and as a society, have to find something in this world to care about. We have to find something in this world that is more important than our challenges and problems. And you? I hope you decide to find something to care about. I hope you find something that's important enough that you're willing to push through your struggles, your fears and your problems to just do the work.

Inside The NASA Mission To Answer 'What Is Life?' Inside The NASA Mission To Answer 'What Is Life?' Matthew Francis \u2014 Mosaic Science Nov 6, 2015, 02:12 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT \u00a9 Adam Batchelor \u201cWhy would NASA want to study a lake in Canada?\u201d Three different border guards asked me variations on that question, and while they ultimately let me pass, it was obvious they didn\u2019t understand. Why is NASA interested in a lake in Canada? And what business is it of mine? As exotic environments go, Pavilion Lake in British Columbia is rather ordinary. Certainly it\u2019s remote \u2013 the closest major city is Vancouver, a long drive away over the mountains. The closest towns are light dustings of houses over the dry slopes, and the road winds for dozens of kilometers of empty desert country between them. The lake itself lies along a paved highway, and from the road it doesn\u2019t look different to any other modestly sized mountain lake in western North America. Advertisement But below the surface, the bottom of Pavilion Lake is dotted with something resembling coral reefs: domes and cones and weird shapes much like artichokes. These are not corals, though, which are colonies of tiny animals: they are rock formations called microbialites, made by and coated in cyanobacteria. Sometimes misleadingly referred to as \u2018blue-green algae\u2019, these bacteria probably even made the rocks they live on, absorbing nutrients from the water and leaving stone behind. Like plants, they live on sunlight, and they thrive in shallow waters down the steep underwater slope to the point where sunlight fades to gloom. They are the reason for NASA\u2019s interest, and my visit. The people I\u2019ve come here to see have even bigger things in mind. They want to know what the rare formations in Pavilion Lake might tell us about the origins of life on Earth, life on other worlds and, indeed, what life is, exactly. \u00a7 Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was a clever guy. You may know him for the famous \u2018Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat\u2019 thought experiment, the feline in a box that is neither dead nor alive until you look inside. However, one of his most interesting works is a slim book from 1944, based on a set of lectures Schr\u00f6dinger gave in Dublin. It poses a single question: What is life? Advertisement The book is significant for predicting some important properties of DNA before they were discovered. Nearly a decade before the famous double-helix structure of DNA was uncovered, Schr\u00f6dinger correctly recognized the key to how organisms evolve and pass information between generations as an \u2018aperiodic crystal\u2019: a chain of atoms that never precisely repeats itself. Even though each link in the chain contains the same atoms (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and phosphorus), their combination allows an enormous amount of information to be encoded. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s simile was Morse code, which reproduces an entire language with only two \u2018letters\u2019. Today we know the DNA code has four letters (A, C, G and T), which by arranging and pairing can encode everything an organism needs to build proteins, run its metabolism, and live. This seems to be a significant distinction between life and non-life: the ability to pass information beyond simple reproduction. Ordinary crystals reproduce themselves, but they only pass along the repetitious pattern of where the atoms go. They can\u2019t evolve. Or, in the words of Schr\u00f6dinger, it\u2019s like the difference between \u201can ordinary wallpaper in which the same pattern is repeated again and again in regular periodicity and a masterpiece of embroidery, say a Raphael tapestry, which shows no dull repetition, but an elaborate, coherent, meaningful design traced by the great master.\u201d Advertisement \u00a7 \u00a9 Adam Batchelor The pontoon boat is loaded nearly to tipping point with people operating and monitoring submersible remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). These little robotic submarines are equipped with high-resolution cameras, and they\u2019re scoping out the part of the lake where human divers will go later in the week. They also carry sensors to measure water temperature, pH, GPS position, depth and current. To achieve the perfect level of buoyancy, the ROVs are rigged with a weird mix of high-tech and low-tech equipment: state-of-the-art motors, and flotation devices made of Wiffle balls and bright orange swimming pool noodles attached with plastic cable ties. One submersible is snooping around on the lake bottom, taking high-resolution images of microbialites; the other\u2019s job is to keep an eye on the first one and track general water conditions. I\u2019m watching all this from the NASA \u2018Mission Control\u2019 trailer on shore, via a video feed from the ROVs. It\u2019s an alien landscape: irregular green-grey mounds the size of tables, some in clusters, some alone, stretching farther than the camera can see into the submarine gloom. Looking at this lake bottom footage, I wonder how much this resembles early Earth. Based on fossil microbialites, ancient relatives of today\u2019s cyanobacteria were probably some of the earliest life on Earth. The oxygen in our atmosphere was probably made by cyanobacteria billions of years ago, which converted the carbon dioxide-heavy atmosphere of early Earth into today\u2019s balance of nitrogen and oxygen long before plants evolved. Modern cyanobacteria are more likely to make slimy mat-like colonies that cover the bottoms of remote lakes than the elaborate, rocky microbialites we see at Pavilion, so it\u2019s probable that was the case 3.5 billion years ago too. Weird as they look, the microbialites might be the only remotely familiar-looking thing to a time traveller who went back to the earliest days of our planet. Because life didn\u2019t just make the air we breathe: to go anywhere, to observe anything on Earth, is to see an environment created by life. The chemistry of rocks, the oceans, the soil \u2013 everything has been shaped by life. And scientists have found organisms \u2013 mostly bacteria and archaeons, single-celled organisms that thrive in extreme environments \u2013 in every place, from rock fissures deep underground to clouds high in the atmosphere. In each environment, the organisms have adapted to their surroundings and shaped those surroundings to suit themselves in turn. Advertisement Traces of that mutual shaping are known as biosignatures, and they are one of Pavilion\u2019s major draws for Allyson Brady. A geochemist at McMaster University, Brady is looking for ways to distinguish abiotic processes \u2013 those happening without life\u2019s influence \u2013 and unambiguous biosignatures. \u201cOnce the bacteria are long dead,\u201d she says, \u201cthe rock itself might still retain the kind of chemical signature that can say \u2018this was created by a biological influence\u2019, as opposed to a purely abiotic chemical one. We do see that in Pavilion.\u201d Biosignatures could be the key to telling us whether a similar stone reef we find on Mars is a fossil microbialite \u2013 a sign of ancient life that once existed \u2013 or a cruel mimic. The relative amounts of different isotopes or the presence of unusual molecules in the rock could reveal the chemical traces produced by the metabolism of microbes long gone. Obviously, the better situation would be to see living microbes (assuming they exist), but that\u2019s trickier than science fiction makes it sound. Any sample of microorganisms collected by a rover, probe or astronaut would have to survive exposure to the equipment, and then be recognizable as living things under a microscope. That\u2019s a time-consuming process and would require some preliminary chemical hint that there\u2019s something worth looking for at the microscopic level. In the absence of Star Trek tricorders to do automatic scanning, researchers look for biosignatures in the soil on Mars, on the ice of Jupiter\u2019s satellite Europa and in the plumes of water shooting up from the ice volcanoes on Enceladus, the sixth-largest moon of Saturn. Advertisement \u00a7 \u00a9 Adam Batchelor On the banks of Pavilion, I am perpetually buzzed by iridescent blue dragonflies, while a loon paddles by. After two days of ROV-only operations, human divers are now on the scene. To accommodate them, the team is taking an extra boat out to the dive site. This time I\u2019m out on the water with them, although my primary task is to stay out of the way. In fact, my view was better back in the trailer: I am limited to watching the scientists watch the monitors and steer the ROVs, unable to witness what the divers are actually doing. Dragonflies, loons, divers and even unusual bacteria are recognizably alive \u2013 as a Sesame Street song says, they \u2018breathe and eat and grow\u2019. But do all living things? Advertisement The hardest part of finding life elsewhere in the cosmos may be recognizing it when we see it. Most life on Earth is microbial, and though we often associate bacteria with disease, most species care not for humans one way or the other. A huge number of species thrive in places that would kill us, and vice versa: deep water, acid caves, bitter cold or boiling hot. Yet there is still kinship between these organisms and us, though evolution and adaptation have separated us. Because of that kinship, all life on Earth is built from cells; it all uses liquid water as part of its essential structure; it is all built of similar molecules containing carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and a few other common elements; and it all uses DNA and RNA to code information about itself and pass that information along to future generations. Yet we must ask: does life have to be that way? If we replayed the history of our solar system, would life use the same chemistry, make cells and shape its environment in the same way? Life is organic, which simply means \u2018molecules containing carbon\u2019. Organic molecules are pretty common in our galaxy. Astronomers have found hints of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) in comets, and nucleobases (the genetic \u2018letters\u2019 of DNA and RNA) in clouds of gas between stars. Advertisement But although water may be necessary for life, it\u2019s so abundant on other worlds and in interstellar space as to be unremarkable. We\u2019ve yet to find any sign of anything out there that could be construed as \u2018life\u2019. Paradoxical as it may sound, there might be inorganic life, too: \u2018organic\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018living\u2019. The silicon-based life that inhabits the popular sci-fi universes of Star Trek and Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld is the result of that kind of thinking. Silicon sits in the same column on the periodic table as carbon, so it is chemically similar. Ultimately the bonds it makes aren\u2019t quite right, so we don\u2019t see it forming the same kinds of molecules. Carbon seems uniquely able, among all the elements on the periodic table, to form structures with other atoms that are complicated enough for life. DNA is certainly complex, which leads many researchers to wonder how it came to be in the first place. One common hypothesis is that RNA \u2013 which exists as a single chain, unlike DNA\u2019s double chain \u2013 came first, but even RNA is complex. \u201cMaybe life didn't start with RNA, but started with something a little bit simpler,\u201d says John Chaput of Arizona State University. \u201cWhatever that simpler material was, it helped produce RNA.\u201d Advertisement The \u2018D\u2019 in DNA and the \u2018R\u2019 in RNA represent the sugars deoxyribose and ribose, respectively. Deoxyribose and ribose are the ladder struts on which the genetic letters are rungs, but they aren\u2019t the only possible sugars for the job. Artificial genetic molecules called \u2018XNA\u2019 can be built from other sugars: X could be any one of a number of other possibilities. Chaput is most interested in the sugar known as \u2018threose\u2019, because the resulting molecule TNA \u2018recognizes\u2019 RNA and links up with it, just as DNA links up with RNA. TNA is simpler than RNA and DNA, both in chemical structure and in how easy it is to make. Chaput and like-minded researchers wonder if TNA came first on early Earth: \u201cBecause TNA was simpler to synthesize, it arose early but was quickly taken over by RNA.\u201d XNAs are only one possible alternative route for life. Carbon makes many more molecules than are used by life as we know it. Proteins don\u2019t use all the types of amino acids; DNA and RNA don\u2019t use all the nucleobase \u2018letters\u2019 that are chemically possible. It\u2019s possible life forms elsewhere could have the same basic organic chemistry and even have genetic codes similar to ours, but use different molecules in constructing their cells. Advertisement \u00a7 \u00a9 Adam Batchelor The weather is sunny and pleasantly warm, but Tyler Mackey and Frances Rivera-Hernandez are dressed for colder temperatures. They are in drysuits, preparing to dive into the cold waters of the lake to make sure all the equipment works before it is needed for scientific sampling later in the week. Mackey\u2019s focus is how microbes shape and are shaped by their environments, and how those interactions might show up in the fossil record on Earth. Much of his thesis work is based on ice-capped lakes in Antarctica. Rivera-Hernandez works for the Mars Science Laboratory team, which operates the Curiosity Rover currently exploring the surface of Mars. She is interested in seeing whether lakes on Earth might share geological attributes with now-dry lakes on Mars, which in the distant past may have been ice-covered pools. Advertisement There\u2019s a lot of talk about Mars at Pavilion. The divers aren\u2019t just collecting scientific data on the microbialites: they\u2019re testing out software and protocols for doing similar things on the surface of the Red Planet. The divers are acting in the stead of astronauts walking on Mars; the boat they dive from is their \u2018command center\u2019 (like one that may someday reside on Mars\u2019 moon Phobos), and the big NASA trailer on the shore serves as \u2018Mission Control\u2019. To make the simulation even more real, the software they use to communicate builds in a five-minute delay each way between Mission Control and the boat to mimic the travel time of signals across the 55 million kilometers from Mars to Earth at their closest approach. With that delay, the divers can\u2019t get instructions directly from \u2018Earth\u2019, which means most actions they take must be carefully planned in advance. (By contrast, the Apollo astronauts had a less substantial communication delay of roughly one second each way.) Future astronauts on Mars are unlikely to find anything so clearly living as the bacteria in Pavilion, but there might be the remains of dead microbialites. Paleontologists have discovered fossils of the layered microbialites known as stromatolites in Australia, Greenland, Antarctica and beyond. Some from western Australia date back 3.5 billion years, not long after the molten Earth first solidified. If Earth-like microbes arose on Mars during a similar time period, but died out (or moved underground) when the planet dried up, there might be similar fossils. Advertisement Presently, surface water on Mars seems to be ephemeral and very salty , but that wasn\u2019t always the case. \u201cIf there ever was abundant water [on Mars] \u2013 which there is plenty of surface evidence for \u2013 it probably would have been frozen over,\u201d says Rivera-Hernandez. That makes cold-water lakes on Earth particularly interesting for someone with an eye on Martian life. Pavilion freezes every winter, and it might even have been covered with a year-round cap of ice during the last Ice Age. Some microbialite structures seem to be old enough to have survived that freezing-over. \u00a7 \u00a9 Adam Batchelor In the 71 years since Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s book, scientists have come a long way toward understanding how life works, but there is still no clear definition of what life is. Evolution is part of it, as is the related concept of passing genetic information from one generation to the next. Metabolism is part of it, altering the chemical balance of its environment in a way that wouldn\u2019t happen otherwise. But while some things are definitely non-living and others decidedly alive, there\u2019s a shadowy region in between. Advertisement That\u2019s the realm of the viruses and the rogue proteins called prions \u2013 infamous for causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\u2018mad cow disease\u2019). Viruses have DNA or RNA but must invade cells to reproduce. Prions are notable because they can transmit information and reproduce without DNA by hijacking other proteins, most damagingly inside brain tissue. Viruses and prions are often harmful, but some types of yeast benefit from prions, and mammals use virus DNA to keep mothers from rejecting fetuses in the womb. Neither are alive in a strict sense \u2013 they don\u2019t grow or multiply without joining themselves to an organism \u2013 yet they can mutate and evolve under the pressure of natural selection. \u201cClearly [a virus] has the capability of following Darwinian evolutionary principles, but not without a host cell,\u201d says David Lynn of Emory University. To him, life and non-life lie on a continuum: \u201cThere is some transition where we might be able to distinguish something that is evolvable on a chemical level and something that is evolvable at a biological level.\u201d In other words, there\u2019s a blurry division between something that requires an external catalyst \u2013 a host cell, brain tissue \u2013 to evolve, and something that can evolve and reproduce on its own. At some point, lifeless chemical processes slipped across that division and became recognizably alive. Lynn thinks a lot about the biochemical information carried in complex molecules, and how to understand evolution in that context. He and his collaborators are investigating whether proteins (which, in a chemical sense, are relatively long chains of organic molecules used in building cells) could store and pass along the same information that the genetic molecules do, without the need for DNA or RNA. But both DNA and proteins are complicated, so the question is whether something else came first in the history of life on Earth that set the stage for both of those complex chemicals. Advertisement The small Canadian lake of Pavilion is one place we can learn how to ask such questions. The various researchers at Pavilion, the biochemists working with XNA and the astrobiologists pondering life on other worlds \u2013 all of them are trying to understand life\u2019s adaptations using the chemistries and materials in each place. Bacteria like the ones living in Pavilion Lake today rarely build microbialite structures; although Pavilion is slightly more alkaline than other nearby lakes and has a higher mineral content, there\u2019s no obvious reason for the structures\u2019 existence. \u201cWhat\u2019s enabling these microbialites to exist in this lake? What is it that\u2019s potentially so special about this lake?\u201d asks Darlene Lim, the principal researcher at Pavilion. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty complicated thing to solve, and it needs a lot of different angles of perspective on it.\u201d All life on Earth is related, with a common ancestor deep in the geologic past. But perhaps life as we know it once coexisted with other biochemistries. If that\u2019s true, over time our distant ancestors were more successful than organisms based on alternative molecular structures, using and shaping the environment until the other forms of life became extinct. That thought is sobering: the death not of a species, but of an entire avenue that might have grown to dominate the planet if history had taken another path. Advertisement These might-have-beens and never-weres aren\u2019t merely the province of speculation. With Mars, with Europa, with thousands of catalogued exoplanets, the range of chemical possibilities could be huge. We cannot afford to assume all life would follow the same path it did on Earth, biologically or chemically. \u2018What is life?\u2019 is not a single question and doesn\u2019t have a single answer. Perhaps it doesn\u2019t need one. Wise souls such as Charles Darwin skipped over such philosophical shenanigans. A tall chimney of rock stands on the mountainside overlooking Pavilion Lake. The Ts\u2019kw\u2019aylaxw First Nation people, whose land includes this whole area, speak of a great dragon living there, watching over the children of the lake. The cyanobacteria are in some sense the offspring of life from the youth of the world. But they are also modern, as all life is: adapted to its environment by the forces of evolution. And although it\u2019s a vague definition, that\u2019s what life is: the shaper, the shaped, the ever-evolving.

Skeletons And Ancient Gold Coins Found During Pompeii Excavation Archeologists uncovered the remains of four young people who took refuge inside a shop nearly 2,000 years ago. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Jun 26, 2016, 11:56 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT One of three gold coins recently recovered during an excavation at a shop outside Pompeii. pompeiisites.org Nearly 2,000 years after Mount Vesuvius buried the Roman town of Pompeii in smoldering ash and pumice, archaeologists have announced several rare finds in the ancient ruins. Four skeletons and gold artifacts were recently discovered inside the site of a former shop located near Pompeii's Herculaneum gate, on the outskirts of the city, Forbes reported , citing Italy\u2019s Archaeological Superintendency of Pompeii. (Pompeii is located about 18 miles south of Naples .) Advertisement #Pompeii #TempusVita - A limestone tomb from the IV cent B.C., gold coins, skeletons of fugitives, and an oven used to make bronze objects, are just some of the artifacts found during new discoveries made at Herculaneum gate. The excavation was carried out in collaboration with the Ecole Francaise in Rome the Centre Jean Berard. __ Nuove scoperte a Porta Ercolano. Tra i ritrovamenti una tomba a cassa in lastre di calcare del IV sec. a.C. con  corredo funerario completo, che si aggiunge alle rare testimonianze funerarie di et\u00e0 preromana; in botteghe poco pi\u00f9 distanti, monete d\u2019oro e oggetti preziosi ritrovati tra gli scheletri dei fuggiaschi; un forno per la fabbricazione di oggetti in bronzo e ancora una cava utilizzata per l\u2019estrazione di materiale per costruzioni. A photo posted by Pompeii Sites (@pompeiisites) on Jun 24, 2016 at 9:29am PDT Inside the store, archaeologists found a gold pendant necklace, three gold coins and an oven used to make bronze objects. In another area, they uncovered a limestone tomb, dating to the fourth century B.C., which contains a body of a man. Archeologists reported finding a limestone tomb containing the remains of a man. Some of the human bones found during the dig are seen. pompeiisites.org Advertisement The four skeletons, believed to have belonged to young people, were found in the back of the shop. The victims, including an adolescent girl, are believed to have sought refuge inside the store before they were overtaken by the volcano. Sadly, the archaeologists weren\u2019t the first to enter the store\u2019s ancient walls. Looters previously tunneled into the store and in their search of treasure pushed the victims\u2019 bodies against a wall. Several photos shared on the historic city\u2019s Facebook page show piles of scattered bones. The bones\u2019 disarrayed state is far different from the usual Pompeii excavations. When the volcano erupted in 79 A.D., those who were not able to escape were buried in tons of ash. In many cases, this casing preserved them until their discovery hundreds of years later. Advertisement The four young people whose bodies were found inside the shop, pictured, are believed to have sought refuge there before being killed. pompeiisites.org Excavations at the shop, as well as a second in the area, started in May, the Associated Press reported . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

New Hampshire Woman Gets New Face For Second Time In 10 Years Carmen Blandin Tarleton is the first American and only the second person to have two face transplants. AP Aug 7, 2020, 03:03 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING BOSTON (AP) \u2014 For the second time in a decade, a New Hampshire woman has a new face. Carmen Blandin Tarleton, whose face was disfigured in an attack by her ex-husband, became the first American and only the second person globally to undergo the procedure after her first transplant began to fail six years after the operation. The transplant from an anonymous donor took place at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in July. The 52-year-old former nurse is expected to resume her normal routine, which all but ended when the first transplant failed a year ago. Advertisement \u201cI\u2019m elated,\u201d Tarleton told The Associated Press, in an exclusive telephone interview from her home in Manchester. She is still healing from the operation so photos are not being made available of her new face. \u201cThe pain I had is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new chapter in my life. I\u2019ve been waiting for almost a year. I\u2019m really happy. It\u2019s what I needed. I got a great match.\u201d More than 40 patients worldwide have received face transplants, including 16 in the United States. None of the American patients had lost their donor faces until Tarleton. Advertisement But in 2018, a French man whose immune system rejected his donor face eight years after his first transplant underwent a second. The doctor who did the transplant, Dr. Laurent Lantieri of the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris, said that patient is \u201cdoing very well.\u201d Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, who did Tarleton\u2019s first face transplant, was hesitant to do another and favored doing reconstruction surgery instead. But his team became convinced of the merits of a second transplant after Tarleton described how much the first one improved her life. \u201cShe really wanted to try one more time,\u201d said Pomahac, who led the 20-hour, second surgery. A team of around 45 clinicians removed the failing transplant and then prepared sensory nerves and blood vessels in the neck for the surgical connection. The face was then transplanted and Tarleton will gain sensory and motor function in the coming months. Advertisement Unlike her first transplant, the donor this time around was considered a much better tissue match. Because of her previous injuries before the first transplant, 98% of donors were incompatible matches. Even then, the first face led to several cases of acute rejection, in which the body attacks the new face and strong drugs are needed to suppress the immune system. \u201cNow, I am very optimistic and hopeful that it will last a lot longer than the first transplant,\u201d said Pomahac, who has described the match as miraculous. \u201cBut, of course, that is wishful thinking, speculation. I don\u2019t know. She really got lucky.\u201d Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic who led its last two face transplants, said Tarleton\u2019s case illustrates the limitations of these procedures. Advertisement \u201cWhen you look at most organ transplants, there is a shelf life,\u201d Gastman said. \u201cWe are getting to the point where these face transplantations are hitting against the maximum number of years someone can have one in.\u201d Tarleton was burned on over 80% of her body and blinded in 2007 when her estranged husband, Herbert Rodgers, beat her with a baseball bat and doused her body with lye because he thought she was seeing another man. In 2009, Rodgers pleaded guilty to maiming Tarleton in exchange for a prison sentence of at least 30 years. He died in prison in 2017. The first transplant transformed Tarleton\u2019s life. She got off strong medications for her pain, took up the piano and was able to travel and give inspirational speeches \u2014 often talking of how she had forgiven Rodgers. She also became close friends with the daughter of her first donor, a 56-year-old woman who died of a stroke. She also got a synthetic cornea in her left eye. Advertisement But by last year, the face was failing. She began experiencing scarring, tightness and pain because of a loss of blood flow to her face. Black patches appeared on her face. Her eyelids contracted and her lips began disappearing, making it difficult to eat. She was mostly housebound and resumed taking strong pain medications. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI was pretty much in pain.\u201d She requested in October to be put the hospital\u2019s list for a second face. That process took much longer, in part, because she was taken off the list for two months because of the coronavirus pandemic. She was added back on when the state allowed elective surgeries to resume. Now that she has her new face, Tarleton is hoping to once again travel and give inspirational speeches \u2014 those will be on Zoom until there is a coronavirus vaccine. For now, she is still getting used to her new appearance. Advertisement \u201cThis face looks very different than my first one and I can appreciate that. It\u2019s a different person,\u201d she said, adding the new face allows her to \u201cfit in a little better, don\u2019t get stared at so easily.\u201d \u201cIt is strange. I am not going to lie,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ll have to get used to it. My sister will have to get used to it. It takes a while for my friends and family to get used to what I look like now.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA's Kepler Spacecraft Recovers From Unexplained Emergency Mode This was the first time the spacecraft has gone into emergency mode during its seven years in space. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Apr 11, 2016, 03:15 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which is seen in an artist's composite, has recovered after switching into emergency mode last week. NASA via Reuters NASA announced Monday that its planet-seeking Kepler spacecraft has recovered after switching into emergency mode, though the reason for the anomaly has yet to be determined. On Thursday, the spacecraft mysteriously went haywire while nearly 75 million miles from Earth. Officials said they were able to get it into a low, fuel-burning stable state Sunday morning. While in emergency mode it was fuel intensive. Advertisement \"It was the quick response and determination of the engineers throughout the weekend that led to the recovery ,\" NASA officials said in a release. \"We are deeply appreciative of their efforts, and for the outpouring of support from the mission's fans and followers from around the world.\" The Kepler spacecraft was launched into space in 2009 with the goal of finding Earth-like planets in the Milky Way galaxy, some of which are seen here. Associated Press Mission operations engineers say they are now working to download data as it\u2019s sent from the spacecraft. They noted in a previous release that it takes about 13 minutes for a signal to travel to the spacecraft and back because of its distance. Advertisement \"Once data is on the ground, the team will thoroughly assess all on board systems to ensure the spacecraft is healthy enough to return to science mode,\" the statement said. As soon as that's a success, the team will work to begin another portion of Kepler's \"K2\" mission. That mission was halted Thursday when NASA discovered the spacecraft was in emergency mode. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Though the spacecraft has had some problems in the past -- notably its significant loss of two of its four reaction wheels in 2013. This was the first time the spacecraft has gone into emergency mode during its seven years in space. Advertisement They said they'll work toward determining the reason for the crisis, but will keep their main focus on returning it to its regular science operations. Its current mission is to find exoplanets while conducting research on young stars, supernovae and other astronomical objects.

Astronaut's Bubbly Experiment Shows Off Incredible New ISS Camera NASA just sent a dragon into space -- an Epic Dragon by RED to be exact. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Jul 30, 2015, 12:24 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Astronauts aboard the International Space Station have a new camera that gives incredible hi-def clarity to the videos they shoot. They're using the device to record all sorts of things, including whimsical little experiments -- just watch what happens when Terry Virts slips an Alka-Seltzer tablet inside a weightless blob of water. NASA Advertisement Just how good is the RED \"Epic Dragon\" camera? A typical digital camera might shoot at 2,000 to 4,000 pixels resolution. The astronauts' \"Epic Dragon\" camera has a resolution a 6,000 pixel resolution. \"This is a huge leap in camera technology for spaceflight,\" Rodney Grubbs, project manger for NASA's Imagery Experts Program, said in a written statement. \"These cameras have large sensors capable of very high resolution imaging at high frame rates. NASA is making this new space footage available to the public on it's ReelNASA YouTube channel -- just be sure to change resolution under \"Settings\" to \"2160p 4K.\" Advertisement NASA Although the videos are only available in 4K resolution right now, they will eventually be available in 6K. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Neuroscientist And Former Addict Explains What We Get Wrong About Addiction He says addiction is \"not a disease\" -- and recognizing that may be the first step to better treating it. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Nov 7, 2015, 10:56 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Ben Goode via Getty Images The prevailing view that addiction is a disease, just like depression or diabetes, is wrong, according to a leading neuroscientist. Marc Lewis, the author of Memoirs of an Addicted Brain and The Biology of Desire , insists that addiction is not a disease and that presenting it as such is harmful. Advertisement The brain changes seen in addiction have more to do with learning and development -- not a chronic brain disease, said Lewis, who became addicted to opiates during his undergraduate years at Berkeley but got clean at age 30 and earned a PhD in developmental psychology. Viewing addiction as a behavioral issue, which has drawn critics and supporters , may pave the way for new approaches to recovery that target the psychological roots of addictive behavior. Addiction is one of the most pressing public health issues in America. An estimated one in 10 Americans suffer from alcohol or drug dependency, while others have behavioral addictions, including porn, sex and gambling. HuffPost Science caught up with Lewis to learn more about the neurobiology of addiction, his challenge to the disease model and some promising new directions for addiction treatment. Advertisement What's wrong with the disease model of addiction? I know what scientists are looking at when they say addiction is a disease. I don't dispute the findings, but I dispute the interpretation of them. They see addiction as a chronic brain disease -- that's how they define it in very explicit terms. My training is in emotional and personality development. I see addiction as a developmental process. So the brain changes that people talk about and have shown reliably in research can be seen as changes that are due to learning, to recurrent and deep learning experiences. But it's not an abnormal experience and there's nothing static or chronic about it, because people continue to change when they recover and come out of addiction. So the chronic label doesn't make much sense. What's problematic about the way we treat addiction, based on the disease model? Well, lots. The rehab industry is a terrible mess -- you either wait on a long list for state-sponsored rehabs that are poorly run or almost entirely 12-Step, or else you pay vast amounts of money for residential rehabs that usually last for 30-90 days and people often go about five to six times. It's very difficult to maintain your sobriety when you go home and you're back in your lonely little apartment. Advertisement What I emphasize is that the disease label makes it worse. You have experts saying, \"You have a chronic brain disease and you need to get it treated. Why don't you come here and spend $100,000 and we'll help you treat it?\" There's a very strong motivation from the family, if not the individual, to go through this process, and then the treatments offered in these places are very seldom evidence-based, and the success rates are low. \u201cThere are lots of ways to trigger a humanistic response besides calling something a disease.\u201d So you would say that telling people who are in recovery for addiction that they have a \"chronic disease\" is actually doing them a disservice? Advertisement Well, the chronic part is really a yoke that people carry around their necks. [Proponents of the disease model] say that this is important because this is how to prevent the stigmatization of addicts, which has been a standard part of our culture since Victorian times. But I think that's just bullshit. I don't think it feels good when someone tells you that you have a chronic disease that makes you do bad things. There are ways to reduce stigmatization by recognizing the humanity involved in addiction, the fact that it happens to many people and the fact that people really do try to get better -- and most of them do. There are lots of ways to trigger a humanistic response besides calling something a disease. It can be difficult to comprehend the idea that something as severe as a heroin addiction is a developmental process. Can you explain that? Advertisement First of all, let's include the whole bouquet of addictions. So there's substances -- drugs and alcohol -- and there's gambling, sex, porn and some eating disorders. The main brain changes that we see in addiction are common to all of them, so they're not specific to taking a drug like heroin, which creates a physical dependence. We see similar brain changes in a region called the striatum , which is an area that's very central to addiction, which is involved in attraction and motivational drive. You see that with gambling as much as you do with cocaine or heroin. So that's the first step of the argument -- it's not drugs, per se. From there, it's important to recognize that certain drugs, like opiates, create physical dependency. There's a double whammy there. They're hard to get off because they're addictive, like sex or porn is, but they also make you uncomfortable when you stop taking them. People try to go off of them and get extremely uncomfortable and then they're drawn back to it -- now for physical as well as psychological reasons. In the case of any type of addiction, what's going on in the brain? The main region of interest is the striatum, and the nucleus accumbens , which is a part of the striatum. That region is responsible for goal pursuit, and it's been around since before mammals. When we are attracted to goals, that region becomes activated by cues that tell you that the goal is available, in response to a stimulus. So you feel attraction, excitement and anticipation in response to this stimulus, and then you keep going after it. The more you go after that stimulus, the more you activate the system and the more you build and then refine synaptic pathways within the system. Advertisement The other part of the brain here that's very important is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in conscious, deliberate control -- reflection, judgment and decision-making. Usually there's a balance between the prefrontal cortex and the striatum, so that you don't get carried away by your impulses. With all kinds of addictions -- drugs, behavior, people -- the prefrontal system becomes less involved in the behavior because the behavior is repeated so many times. It becomes automatic, like riding a bike. What would a scientifically informed approach to addiction look like? That's a really hard question because the fact that we know what's happening in the brain doesn't mean that we know what to do about it. A lot of recent voices have emphasized that addiction tends to be a social problem. Often addicts are isolated; they very often have difficult backgrounds in terms of childhood trauma, stress, abuse or neglect -- so they're struggling with some degree of depression or anxiety -- and then they are socially isolated, they don't know how to make friends and they don't know how to feel good without their addiction. Advertisement So what can we do about that? Other than certain drugs that can reduce withdrawal symptoms, there's nothing much medicine can offer, so we have to turn to psychology, and psychology actually offers a fair bit. There's cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, dialectic behavioral therapy, and now there are mindfulness-based approaches, which I think are really exciting. There's been good research from Sarah Bowen in Seattle [ on Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention ] showing that mindfulness practices can have a significant impact on people, even on people who are deeply addicted to opiates. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Florida Python Challenge Nets 106 Snakes During Monthlong Hunt Daniel Moniz, who said he took a snakebite to the face while wrestling a 13-footer, snagged two of the top prizes. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Feb 28, 2016, 02:32 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Daniel Moniz is seen showcasing two of his catches, the one on the left measuring 13 feet and the one on the right measuring 12 feet. Daniel Moniz More than 1,000 hunters armed with pillowcases and their bare hands removed 106 invasive Burmese pythons from the Florida Everglades, the largest of which was 15 feet long. The results of the monthlong 2016 Python Challenge were announced Saturday by state wildlife officials, with a landscaper from New Jersey taking two of the top cash prizes. Advertisement Daniel Moniz, 22, of Brick Township managed to bag 13 pythons, the most by any individual, as well as the longest by any individual, measuring 13 feet. Winners: Daniel Moniz, center, is seen with two members of the winning team, Cypress Boys. FWC The longest snake captured, which was 15 feet long, was a group effort pulled off by Bill Booth, Duane Clark, Dusty Crum and Craig Nicks. That same team captured the most collective pythons with 33. Advertisement The annual hunt targeted the invasive species because of its detrimental effects on the local ecosystem. The snakes are capable of growing up to 26 feet long and prove to be a top predator of the natural wildlife, including alligators and deer. Hunting Burmese pythons was what brought Moniz down to Florida after growing up catching snakes in the Garden State. That's not to say he had ever caught a python before. His largest catch before the Everglades trip was a 6-foot black rat snake, he told The Huffington Post. Advertisement Daniel Moniz is seen holding one of his catches during the Python Challenge in the Florida Everglades. Daniel Moniz \"I've caught a few venomous snakes before, which may have been smaller but equally as dangerous,\" Moniz said by email Sunday. Asked if there were any particularly rattling moments during his hunt, he boldly replied: \"I never really felt fear as I was hunting snakes.\" Advertisement \"My biggest fear was probably scaring my mom too much -- especially the pictures of my bloody face,\" he said. Those pictures were taken after he was chomped on by a 13-footer. The New Jersey landscaper is seen showing off his battle wounds after wrestling a 13-footer. Daniel Moniz While Moniz was wrestling the snake, the monster reptile was able to sink its teeth into his cheek and neck. Once he pried it off him, it got another bite of his arm. Advertisement Fortunately for Moniz, he said none of the bites were major, and he didn't seek medical help. On his blog he documented the dramatic fight, as well as the rest of his adventures while riding around on a bicycle with pillowcases. One such incident was his wrestling what he described as a 12-foot \u201cmonster female\u201d that put up a tough fight before being successfully bagged. \"This python even managed to ankle-cuff me, making it hard to move!

An Alzheimer's Treatment on the Horizon? Biogen Inc.'s recent revelation of promising early data from an experimental Alzheimer's treatment is something of a breakthrough: it's the first time that we have seen positive human data about a new Alzheimer's drug that can both reduce the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain and improve cognitive function. By Howard Fillit, MD, Contributor Geriatrician, neuroscientist, and Founding Executive Director and Chief Science Officer of the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation Geriatrician, neuroscientist, and Founding Executive Director and Chief Science Officer of the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation Apr 3, 2015, 05:50 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Biogen Inc.'s recent revelation of promising early data from an experimental Alzheimer's treatment is something of a breakthrough: it's the first time that we have seen positive human data about a new Alzheimer's drug that can both reduce the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain and improve cognitive function. An estimated 5.3 million Americans are believed to be living with Alzheimer's and currently there are no FDA-approved drugs that slow or prevent the neurodegenerative disease. Advertisement In the past, despite early stage (phase 2) positive results, late-stage Alzheimer's research has repeatedly failed in expensive phase 3 tests, so when Biogen, a Cambridge, Massachusetts biotech company, announced some of the most promising Alzheimer's phase 1b results it grabbed our attention. We routinely hear hype about potential new drugs for Alzheimer's disease. What's often missing from the reporting is the fact that these drugs are typically only at the \"preclinical\" stage of research. This means that a new drug is being studied in test tubes or animal models for its effect on simulations of Alzheimer's disease. Drugs at this stage might offer great promise for patients with Alzheimer's, but they're a long way from testing in humans and any chance of FDA-approval. Biogen's results suggest that attacking amyloid may be a therapeutic strategy that could be available for patients living with Alzheimer's disease in the next few years. Advertisement The drug, called aducanumab, is a monoclonal antibody vaccine -- a large biological agent that needs to be administered intravenously, probably every month. Most FDA-approved drugs are small molecules, which can be ingested in pill form. The Biogen compound is similar to the molecules the immune system normally produces in response to infections or to clear debris from areas of injured tissue. These antibodies are very specific to their beta-amyloid target, which are involved in genetic, familial forms of Alzheimer's, and may also be involved in the senile, old-age forms of Alzheimer's. The results that Biogen unveiled in Nice, France were the culmination of several years of costly and time-intensive preclinical and clinical research. The monoclonal antibody Biogen presented binds together amyloid plaques and crosses the blood-brain barrier. These results are especially meaningful because the study was conducted in human populations, part of a phase 1b clinical trial. The primary purpose of the study was safety, but the company also included biomarkers of the disease and cognitive function as secondary outcomes. Advertisement These biomarkers included Amyvid, the beta-amyloid PET brain imaging test that the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation helped to develop. The brain scan technology was used to enroll patients in the study and to ensure that they had a verifiable Alzheimer's diagnosis. The results showed, probably for the first time in a well-designed clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease, a believable, dose-related stabilization or slowing of cognitive and functional decline. They also demonstrated the first-ever dose-related reduction in brain amyloid, suggesting that the drug was hitting its target in the brain. The fact that the results were dose related adds credibility to the evidence that the positive clinical trial results were due to the drug rather than chance. Researchers also saw improvement on other biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. Advertisement These are very hopeful results, but they are not without caveats. This was an early stage, phase 1b study with a relatively small number of patients. In total, only 166 patients enrolled in the study, broken into four groups of about 40 each: three groups taking different doses of aducanumab and one group taking a placebo. For a safety study that enables a drug to move further in clinical testing, this relatively small number of patients is reasonable. But for a study designed to prove efficacy, it is too small to draw truly reliable conclusions and creates the possibility that the results happened by chance. Studies that prove efficacy in later stages of clinical research often enroll 3000 or more patients. There were also many people who dropped out of the study because of serious side effects, especially patients in the highest dose group--the same group that had the highest efficacy rates. These dropouts confound the statistical analysis of the trial and create concerns about safety. Advertisement But none of this takes away from the fact that the results of this Alzheimer's clinical trial are the most hopeful I have ever seen. Biogen is taking a big risk -- one that should be applauded -- by aiming to go directly from this phase 1b trial to a phase 3 trial enrolling a few thousand patients. Usually, research progresses through phase 2 trials -- which study a drug in an affected population of several hundred patients -- and then to phase 3 trials to demonstrate efficacy. Generally, the FDA requires two phase 3 trials to provide a regulatory approval. Given the scale of the Alzheimer's epidemic (and the absence of any FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments), it is possible that the FDA might grant some form of special approval if Biogen sees very positive results in its forthcoming phase 3 trial. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Science is always incremental, building on what has been done before. This clinical trial learned from previous trials by studying patients with earlier stage mild Alzheimer's disease at which time treatment might be more effective. It also exclusively enrolled patients with a positive amyloid brain PET scan to be certain they had the biological markers of Alzheimer's, rather than exhibiting only clinical indications of the disease. (Previous studies were confounded by the presence of up 30 percent of patients who turned out not to have the disease on subsequent amyloid brain scanning.) Advertisement If the phase 3 test is also positive, a pathway for the development of other new drugs for Alzheimer's based on this model will also have been established. That alone is a very important outcome for Alzheimer's drug discovery research.

By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post and Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Sep 6, 2015, 08:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There's a big difference between science and science fiction, but sci-fi books and movies have inspired some of the greatest minds of today. \"The best of the science fiction films will stimulate a curiosity and an interest in a topic,\" astrophysicist Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of New York's Hayden Planetarium, told Vanity Fair in a June 2014 interview. HuffPost Science reached out to top scientists and science enthusiasts to ask which science fiction movies and classics were their favorites. Here is a slightly condensed version of their responses. Advertisement Jane Goodall Primatologist, founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and UN Messenger of Peace \" Three books of my childhood probably had the greatest impact on my life . The Story of Doctor Dolittle' (by Hugh Lofting) and 'Tarzan of the Apes' (by Edgar Rice Burroughs) inspired me to understand what animals were trying to tell us and instilled within me an equally strong determination to travel to Africa, live with animals, and write books about them. 'The Miracle of Life' was a large book my grandmother got for free by saving up coupons from cereal packets. It was by no means a book intended for children.\" Temple Grandin Animal scientist and author of \"The Autistic Brain\" \"I\u2019m a Star trek fan... The one I've always liked the best was the one about the whales. It had them coming to Earth and dressing up as Earth people. Some of the later movies haven\u2019t been as good. They\u2019re going with too 'whizz-bam' special effects.\" Advertisement Michael Shermer Historian of science and founding publisher of Skeptic magazine \"My favorite sci-fi film is the 1951 The Day the Earth Stood Still , a Christ allegory in which an alien named Klaatu (who takes the name 'Mr. Carpenter' while visiting Earth) admonishes humans for threatening nuclear annihilation and insists that they will not be allowed to join the planetary community as long as they retain nuclear weapons.\" Advertisement Seth Shostak Senior astronomer and director at the Center for SETI Research \"Stanislaw Lem wrote a short story, 'Golem XIV,' in the early 1980s that is my go-to reference when anyone asks me, 'What will the aliens be like?' No, they\u2019re not short, hairless, gray guys -- they\u2019re intelligent machines. And while Lem wasn\u2019t talking about aliens in his story, I figure that any extraterrestrials we ever detect really are likely to have moved on from biological brains to cybernetic cerebellums... [My favorite sci-fi movie] has got to be the first incarnation of H.G. Wells\u2019 War of the Worlds, dating back to 1953.\" Chris Stringer Anthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London \"Brazil -- quirky, with humour and horror juxtaposed, and full of little details about the alternative world that Terry Gilliam creates. And Michael Palin outstanding as a nice man turned into a torturer by the system.\" Advertisement Adam Riess Astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University \"As a 'card carrying' astrophysicist I tend to like my science fiction to be plausible-science fiction. My usual rule for such work is you can make up one outlandish concept that has some foundation in science and then the story should follow the consequences of that concept. Here are ones I like, 'Contact'-Carl Sagan; ' The Fountains of Paradise'-Arthur C. Clarke; 'Childhood's End'-Arthur C. Clarke; 'The Songs of Distant Earth'-Arthur C. Clarke; 'The Martian Chronicles'-Ray Bradbury; 'Fahrenheit 451'-Ray Bradbury; 'Foundation' series-Isaac Asimov; 'Silo' saga-Hugh Howey; 'The Stand'-Stephen King; ' Watership Down '-Richard Adams; 'The Day of the Triffids'-John Wyndham.\" Advertisement Jack Horner Paleontologist at Montana State University and consultant for Jurassic Park films \" Jurassic Park is my favorite movie because the paleontologist Alan Grant says all the things I would have said if it had not been a movie!! And bringing back dinosaurs is a goal.\" Steven Strogatz Professor of mathematics at Cornell University \"'The Andromeda Strain' kept me riveted from the first sentence: 'A man with binoculars'... [and] Colossus: The Forbin Project terrified me as a kid growing up at the end of the Cold War. And like everyone else, I'm still trying to figure out 2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Advertisement Ainissa Ramirez Materials scientist and author of \"Newton's Football\" \"'Parable of the Sower: Octavia Butler' made me pause because it described what the future could be in a very believable way. Star Wars excited all of my senses and made me think that anything was possible. We all have a hero within.\" Advertisement Mario Livio Astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute \"The books that fascinated me the most as a child were those by Jules Verne. I count here in particular, 'Around the World in Eighty Days,' 'Journey to the Center of the Earth,' and 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.' In terms of films, I remember having been impressed very much at the time with 2001: A Space Odyssey, with Dr. Strangelove, and with Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" Olympia LePoint Rocket scientist and author of \"Mathaphobia\" \"One of my favorite science-fiction movies is Gravity starring Sandra Bullock. As a rocket scientist, I was blown away by the stunning visual effects and three-dimensional-like movement. Plus, I am thankful that producers and writers cast a woman as an astronaut to bring science concerns to the forefront of American and international discussion... [Also] Back to The Future starring Michael J. Fox. Time travel in movies wasn't uncommon before 1985, but the concept of building a ground propulsion machine from a DeLorean car inspired me to investigate aerospace engineering.\" Advertisement Danielle Lee Biologist and author of Scientific American's The Urban Scientist \" Dune -- the old one with Sting. I love that movie with its messages of imperialism, environmental conservation, and social justice. 'The Spice must flow. The Spice must flow!\" Advertisement Neil deGrasse Tyson Astrophysicist, cosmologist, and director of the Hayden Planetarium Last year, he told the Los Angeles Times , \"The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). The story was so strong and compelling that the film did not require heavy special effects or monsters or violence to be simultaneously hopeful and terrifying.... [and] 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)... Planet of the Apes (1968)... The Terminator (1984)... The Quiet Earth (1985)... Contact (1997)... Deep Impact (1998)... The Matrix (1999)... The Island (2005)...

That Space Flower Is Still A Big Deal, Even If It's Not The First (UPDATED) Now it's even more pathetic if you can't keep your desk plant alive. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 18, 2016, 11:29 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT UPDATE: Jan. 22 -- A zinnia that recently blossomed on the International Space Station is an incredible scientific accomplishment. But it is not the first flower grown in space, as was announced by astronaut Scott Kelly in a tweet, and as was reported here and elsewhere. The Washington Post notes that while the latest blooms are \"the first grown from start-to-finish in an official NASA mission,\" flowers have bloomed on the ISS before. Astronaut Don Petit, conducting an unofficial experiment in 2012, documented a \" space zucchini \" that bloomed in the company of a sunflower on the space station. Advertisement Before that, in the early 1980s, a Soviet cosmonaut managed to get blossoms from a batch of rockcress, Gizmodo notes , an accomplishment that's listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the \"first species of plant to flower in space.\" Space.com, however, tracked down an account of a unmanned 1966 Russian space probe that carried a crop of haricot beans that sprouted and flowered. Previously: This flower is out of this world. The 13-petaled orange zinnia is the first ever to be grown in the zero gravity of space. And after a rocky start to its life on board the International Space Station, it appears to finally be blooming. #SpaceFlower out in the sun for the first time! #YearInSpace pic.twitter.com/Cghu9XGv1J \u2014 Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) January 17, 2016 Advertisement U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly proudly tweeted a snap of the plant on Sunday. \" #SpaceFlower out in the sun for the first time! #YearInSpace,\" he wrote. \" Yes, there are other life forms in space!\" he added in a later post. Kelly is right to be pleased. The zinnia's flowering is a landmark moment in science and also testament to his hard work in saving the specimen after it nearly died. On Dec. 27 he tweeted a sad image showing the plants leaves' curled and covered in mold. \"Our plants aren't looking too good. Would be a problem on Mars,\" he wrote. Advertisement Our plants aren't looking too good. Would be a problem on Mars. I'm going to have to channel my inner Mark Watney. pic.twitter.com/m30bwCKA3w \u2014 Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) December 27, 2015 According to a NASA blog about the experiment, the seed containers were leaking and the plants roots' were being flooded . After vowing to channel his \"inner Mark Watney\" -- the stranded NASA astronaut Matt Damon plays in \"The Martian\" -- Kelly quickly set about reviving them. Advertisement He changed the watering of the plants and instead of following a strict schedule just topped them up when he felt they needed it, according to Engadget. \"If we're going to Mars, and we were growing stuff, we would be responsible for deciding when the stuff needed water,\" he said at the time. Some of my space flowers are on the rebound! No longer looking sad! #YearInSpace pic.twitter.com/HJzXaTItIf \u2014 Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) January 8, 2016 Advertisement After a hairy few days when some of the plants ended up dying, he succeeded in nurturing a couple until one flowered. The dead flowers will be taken back to Earth and analyzed, per the NASA blog. NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid grew wheat stalks on the Russian Mir space station in 1996 and others have successfully grown lettuce in June 2014 on the ISS. But this is the first time a flower has bloomed. Wheat stalks were previously grown in space, but this is the first time a flower has bloomed. Adam Gault/Getty Images Advertisement \"The zinnia plant is very different from lettuce,\" said Trent Smith, project manager of the ISS Veggie facility. Smith said they were \"more sensitive\" to light characteristics and had a longer growth duration of 60 to 80 days. \"Thus, it is a more difficult plant to grow, and allowing it to flower, along with the longer growth duration, makes it a good precursor to a tomato plant,\" Smith added, according to NASA's blog. Alexandra Whitmire, of the NASA Human Research Program, said growing plants in space could raise crew morale. \"Plants can indeed enhance long-duration missions in isolated, confined and extreme environments -- environments that are artificial and deprived of nature.\" Advertisement Scientists will continue to monitor the zinnia crop. And, according to Engadget, the next step in producing organic space food could be sending tomato seeds to the ISS in 2018.

Nobel Laureate\u2019s Tongue-In-Cheek Resume Deserves A Prize Of Its Own \"October 1941: Conceived by optimistic parents,\" is one highlight of Jacques Dubochet's professional record. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Oct 4, 2017, 07:43 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING The world\u2019s top scientists can have a sense of humor, too, you know. Just check out the resume of new Nobel laureate Jacques Dubochet. The professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland was one of three scientists to scoop the 2017 Nobel Prize for Chemistry on Wednesday. But as Twitter user Oliver Fuchs discovered, the researcher took a rather lighthearted approach when working up his CV: Advertisement The CV of the Swiss #NobelPrize -Laureate at @unil , Jacques Dubochet, is really funny. https://t.co/4DyUo6Ojjy pic.twitter.com/wzyTSd7NwG \u2014 Oliver Fuchs (@oliphox) October 4, 2017 Dubochet detailed how he was \u201cconceived by optimistic parents\u201d in October 1941. He also noted the date of when he was \u201cno longer scared of the dark\u201d and explained why becoming the \u201cfirst official dyslexic in the canton of Vaud\u201d in 1955 ended up benefitting him. Read his entire CV on his university\u2019s website . The Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences awarded the Nobel Prize, and $1.1 million, to Dubochet, Joachim Frank from New York\u2019s Columbia University and Richard Henderson of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, for their developments in electron microscopy.

Remains Of Prehistoric Monument Discovered Near Stonehenge \"Everything written previously about the Stonehenge landscape and the ancient monuments within it will need to be re-written.\" By Lydia O'Connor Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sep 7, 2015, 02:22 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Archaeologists announced Monday that they've discovered the remains of another prehistoric stone monument less than two miles from Stonehenge, and it's completely reshaping how researchers understand the history of the area. The arrangement, believed to be about 4,500 years old, was revealed by the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project on the first day of the British Science Festival at the University of Bradford. Advertisement It is composed of about 30 intact stones and 60 fragments of possible stones buried three feet beneath the Durrington Walls \"super-henge\" and though to be a Neolithic ritual site. The stones, some of which stand up to 14 feet high, appear as if they were once lined up to form a C-shaped \"arena\" surrounding a valley and springs leading to the River Avon. None have been excavated, and they were found using \"non-invasive geophysical prospection and remote sensing technologies,\" a press release from the project said. The archaeologists believe this new discovery could predate Stonehenge and presents the possibility that monumental architecture was happening in the area earlier than previously thought. Advertisement \"The extraordinary scale, detail and novelty of the evidence produced by the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, which the new discoveries at Durrington Walls exemplify, is changing fundamentally our understanding of Stonehenge and the world around it,\" Paul Garwood, the principal prehistorian on the project, said in the press release. \"Everything written previously about the Stonehenge landscape and the ancient monuments within it will need to be re-written .\" It may also be the largest Neolithic site yet discovered. \u201cWhat we are starting to see is the largest surviving stone monument , preserved underneath a bank, that has ever been discovered in Britain and possibly in Europe,\u201d Vince Gaffney, who leads the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape project, told The Guardian. \u201cThis is archaeology on steroids.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 30, 2015, 04:41 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Skywatchers are in for a rare treat tomorrow in the form of a blue moon . Of course, a blue moon isn't actually blue. That's just the term used to describe the moon when it's full for the second time in a single calendar month--in this case July. The month's first full moon occurred on July 2. Its second occurs officially at 6:43 a.m. EDT tomorrow, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory. If you don't want to get up early, Slooh Space Camera will live-stream the moon at 8:30 p.m. EDT. Advertisement In a typical year, there are 12 full moons--one every 29.5 days or so. But this year there are 13 (including tomorrow's blue moon). The last time we saw two full moons in a single month was August 2012. There won't be another blue moon until January 2018 , CNN reported. Send us your photos of the blue moon by tweeting us at @HuffPostScience or use the hashtag #HPBlueMoon. We'll be collecting user photos from all over the world and yours just may appear on HuffPost Science! How did Earth get its moon in the first place?

There's A Good Chance Your Brain Will Fall For This Color Trick Looks can be deceiving. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Jun 24, 2016, 01:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Focus on the green dot and you just might learn something. Your brain is pretty remarkable when it comes to deciphering colors, but it does have the ability to play tricks on you. This video from the folks at AsapSCIENCE demonstrates the effect of afterimaging , which happens when the cones in your eyes become fatigued as their supply of photopigment is exhausted and photo signals to the brain halt. Advertisement After a quick color test, the video proceeds to a crash course on all things color and your brain. Why do bananas appear yellow? Why are plants green, but not flowers?

Super Strypi Rocket Explodes During Inaugural Flight From Hawaii Thirteen satellites were destroyed in the launch. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 4, 2015, 06:06 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT An experimental U.S. military rocket broke apart Tuesday about a minute into its maiden flight from Hawaii's Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai. A video posted by a spectator shows the 67-foot Super Strypi rocket -- a technology aimed at providing a cheaper way of launching smaller payloads into space -- make a clean lift off before erratically spinning out of control. Advertisement In a statement Tuesday, the U.S. Air Force confirmed the ORS-4 mission \" failed in mid-flight \" after liftoff at 5:45 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time. James Spellman Jr. of the U.S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center told The Huffington Post in an email Wednesday that it's \"too early in the investigative process to speculate\" about what may have caused the failure. Thirteen satellites were destroyed in the crash, including the University of Hawaii's HiakaSat, a 121-pound satellite with a hyperspectral imaging camera to test new Earth observation technologies for military and scientific applications. Advertisement The Air Force\u2019s ORS office, established by the Pentagon in 2007, spent more than $45 million on the ORS-4 mission before Tuesday\u2019s demo flight, according to Spaceflight Now. The inaugural flight was originally scheduled for October 2013, but was pushed back multiple times due to technology and timing issues , the Star Advertiser reported. The University of Hawaii said in a statement that despite the mishap, the project is still a \"tremendous success.\" Advertisement \" About 150 students worked on the payload , a hyperspectral imager called HiakaSat,\" the university wrote. \"All milestones for the payload were met and the students received real-world aerospace experience in building a sophisticated satellite.\" Super Strypi, also known as SPARK (Space-borne Payload Assist Rocket - Kauai), was developed by Sandia National Laboratories, the University of Hawaii and Aerojet Rocketdyne. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Reuters Oct 2, 2017, 06:22 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING STOCKHOLM \u2015 U.S.-born scientists Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young won the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling our biological clocks, the award-giving body said on Monday. The mechanisms help explain issues such as why people traveling long distances over several time zones often suffer jet lag, and they have wider implications for health such as increased risk for certain diseases. Advertisement \u2033(The three scientists\u2019) discoveries explain how plants, animals and humans adapt their biological rhythm so that it is synchronized with the Earth\u2019s revolutions,\u201d the Nobel Assembly at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute said in a statement. The laureates used fruit flies to isolate a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythm and showed how this gene encoded a protein that accumulates in the cell during the night and degrades during the day. \u201cThe clock regulates critical functions such as behavior, hormone levels, sleep, body temperature and metabolism,\u201d the assembly said on awarding the prize of 9 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million). Advertisement Thomas Perlmann, secretary at the Karolinska Institute Nobel Committee, described the reaction of Rosbash when first informed of the award: \u201cHe was silent and then he said \u2018you are kidding me\u2019.\u201d Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

'Moby Dick' May Be More Than Just A Whale Of A Tale New research suggests sperm whales can use their huge heads as battering rams against ships and each other. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Apr 9, 2016, 11:07 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A new study suggests that the structure of a sperm whale's forehead evolved to function as a massive battering ram for when males compete for mates. Photo by Reinhard Dirscherl / Ullstein Bild Debate has swirled for nearly 200 years around whether sperm whales rammed whaling ships with their foreheads to sink them. Director Ron Howard's 2015 film, \" In the Heart of the Sea ,\" details the story of such an attack in 1820 involving the gentle giants, which can reach up to more than 60 feet in length . The sinking of that American whaling ship -- the Essex -- was also the inspiration for Herman Melville's 1851 novel, \"Moby Dick.\" Advertisement Now, new research suggests that the structure of a sperm whale's forehead evolved to function as a massive battering ram for when males compete with each other for mates . And this behavior might be capable of sinking ships without the whales hurting themselves during such a collision, according to a study, published in the peer-reviewed journal PeerJ on Tuesday. Researchers used simulations to determine if the structure of the forehead significantly reduces stress in a sperm whale's skull during impacts. Advertisement The forehead of a sperm whale contains two large oil-filled compartments -- one called the \" spermaceti organ \" and the other known as \"junk\" -- that may play a role in these ocean creatures' ramming capabilities, the study found. This oil was the main target of the 19th century whaling industry. \"The forehead of the sperm whale is one of the strangest structures in the animal kingdom,\" said study lead author Dr. Olga Panagiotopoulou, an expert in the anatomy, bone biology and mechanics of large animals in a statement . \"Our findings show that connective tissue partitions within 'the junk' of the sperm whale forehead may function as a shock absorber.\" The forehead of a sperm whale contains two large oil-filled compartments that may play a role in these ocean creatures' ramming capabilities, the study finds. Dr. Ali Nabavizadeh/University of Chicago Advertisement The controversial theory that a sperm whale's head has a battering ram function emerged in the 19th century following a specific incident. \"After a large male rammed and sank his ship in the Pacific in 1820, whaler Owen Chase described the whale's head as admirably designed for this mode of attack,\" said Panagiotopoulou. \"Until our research, its mechanical feasibility had never been addressed. The scientific community received the ramming hypothesis with reluctance,\" she added. \"This was mainly because the front part of the sperm whale head houses sensitive anatomical structures that are essential for sonar communication between whales, and they would be in harm's way in a ramming event. Also, not many people had actually observed sperm whales ramming.\" Advertisement Conservation investigator Sandra Lanham sent the researchers a report last year detailing how she saw two sperm whales ramming while flying over the Gulf of California in 1997.

The scientists now want to learn more about how whales are able to continue this activity while avoiding fatal skull fractures. Advertisement \"Our study has limitations, but we hope it might stimulate future research to unravel the mechanical function of the head during head-butting events in other species, where aggressive behavior has been observed but remains unmodeled,\" Panagiotopoulou said.

Giant Artwork Reflects The Gorgeous Complexity of The Human Brain The new work at The Franklin Institute may be the most complex and detailed artistic depiction of the brain ever. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jun 25, 2016, 08:54 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A computer image of \"Self Reflected,\" an etching of a human brain created by artists Greg Dunn and Brian Edwards. Greg Dunn and Brian Edwards Your brain has approximately 86 billion neurons joined together through some 100 trillion connections, giving rise to a complex biological machine capable of pulling off amazing feats. Yet it's difficult to truly grasp the sophistication of this interconnected web of cells. Now, a new work of art based on actual scientific data provides a glimpse into this complexity. The 8-by-12-foot gold panel, depicting a sagittal slice of the human brain, blends hand drawing and multiple human brain datasets from several universities. The work was created by Greg Dunn , a neuroscientist-turned-artist , and Brian Edwards, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania, and goes on display Saturday at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. There will be a public unveiling and a lecture by the artists at 3 p.m. Advertisement \"The human brain is insanely complicated,\" Dunn said. \"Rather than being told that your brain has 80 billion neurons, you can see with your own eyes what the activity of 500,000 of them looks like, and that has a much greater capacity to make an emotional impact than does a factoid in a book someplace.\" Artists Greg Dunn and Brian Edwards present their work at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. Will Drinker To reflect the neural activity within the brain, Dunn and Edwards have developed a technique called micro-etching: They paint the neurons by making microscopic ridges on a reflective sheet in such a way that they catch and reflect light from certain angles. When the light source moves in relation to the gold panel, the image appears to be animated, as if waves of activity are sweeping through it. Advertisement First, the visual cortex at the back of the brain lights up, then light propagates to the rest of the brain, gleaming and dimming in various regions -- just as neurons would signal inside a real brain when you look at a piece of art. That's the idea behind the name of Dunn and Edwards' piece: \"Self Reflected.\" It's basically an animated painting of your brain perceiving itself in an animated painting. Here's a video (made by Will Drinker) to give you an idea of how the etched neurons light up as the light source moves: Advertisement To make the artwork resemble a real brain as closely as possible, the artists used actual MRI scans and human brain maps, but the datasets were not detailed enough. \"There were a lot of holes to fill in,\" Dunn said. Several students working with the duo explored scientific literature to figure out what types of neurons are in a given brain region, what they look like and what they are connected to. Then the artists drew each neuron. A close-up of the cerebellum in the finished work. Will Drinker and Greg Dunn Advertisement A close-up of the motor cortex in the finished work. Will Drinker and Greg Dunn Dunn and Edwards then used data from DTI scans -- a special type of imaging that maps bundles of white matter connecting different regions of the brain. This completed the picture, and the results were scanned into a computer. Using photolithography, the artists etched the image onto a panel covered with gold leaf. Then, they switched on the lights: Advertisement This is what \"Self Reflected\" looks like when it's illuminated with all white light. Will Drinker and Greg Dunn \"A lot of times in science and engineering, we take a complex object and distill it down to its bare essential components, and study that component really well\" Edwards said. But when it comes to the brain, understanding one neuron is very different from understanding how billions of neurons work together and give rise to consciousness. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Advertisement The artists hope their work will inspire people, even professional neuroscientists, \"to take a moment and remember that our brains are absolutely insanely beautiful and they are buzzing with activity every instant of our lives,\" Dunn said. \"Everybody takes it for granted, but we have, at the very core of our being, the most complex machine in the entire universe.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.
