Weird Green Ice Floats In Antarctic Harbor Scientists want to know why the green hue shows up at certain times each year. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Mar 14, 2017, 09:11 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT On March 5, 2017, NASA\u2019s Operational Land Imager captured this view of water, sea ice and phytoplankton above Antarctica\u2019s Granite Harbor near the Ross Sea. This first image shows a wide view of the area. The next two images show detailed views of the green slush ice. NASA Just in time for St. Patrick\u2019s Day, NASA has released images of a region in Antarctica called Granite Harbor \u2015 a cove near the Ross Sea. (See main image above.) These pictures \u2015 taken by the Operational Land Imager on the Landsat 8 satellite on March 5 \u2015 offer details of what is apparently green slush ice, according to NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory site . Advertisement The following images are zoomed-in areas of the Granite Harbor region. This is the first zoomed-in area showing the green hue of the Antarctic ice. NASA This is the second zoomed-in area showing the green hue of the Antarctic ice. NASA Earth Observatory reports that marine glaciologist Jan Lieser , of the Australia Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Center, believes the green hue in the ice is a result of a bloom of phytoplankton on the water, which has discolored the ice. Advertisement According to the National Ocean Service , phytoplankton are microscopic marine plants, part of the oceanic food chain that provides nourishment for many aquatic creatures, like whales, shrimp, snails and jellyfish. (See image below.) Phytoplankton, microscopic marine plants, part of the oceanic food chain that provides nourishment for many aquatic creatures, like whales, shrimp, snails and jellyfish. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA Mesa Project This isn\u2019t the first time that scientists have discovered phytoplankton in an icy region of the world. In 2011, at the opposite end of Earth in Arctic waters, NASA researchers were stunned when they found a massive phytoplankton bloom growing beneath the sea ice, as shown in the following video: Advertisement Microalgae abounds in the Antarctic, but Earth Observatory indicates the following factors are necessary for plankton to survive in large amounts that would make it visible from space: sea ice, winds, sunlight, nutrient availability and predators. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These 9 Discovered Species Made 2015 A Dinomite Year One species has been described as \"feathery, fluffy, winged Chickens from Hell.\" By Chloe Fox Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Dec 19, 2015, 07:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Most of us can only name a handful of dinosaur groups and species, namely those that were represented in \" The Land Before Time .\" Dinosaurs like the Apatosaurus (aka Little Foot), Triceratops (aka Cera), Stegosaurus (aka Spike) and Tyrannosaurus (aka Chomper) get all the glory, even though scientists have named approximately 700 dinosaur species. Making sense of fossils from 100 million years ago, however, is tricky business. Many scientists have a hard time agreeing on distinctions and some studies suggest there isn't enough evidence to fully support the uniqueness of half of the named dinosaur species. Advertisement Still, paleontologists think there are least 700 to 900 species still waiting to be discovered -- and 2015 helped us inch toward that enlightenment. Below, check out nine totally weird species discovered this year, as well as what we imagine their names should have been. Because dino-love never goes extinct. Qijianglong, or The Long-Necked Dragon Illustration: Lida Xing Believed to have roamed Asia about 160 million years ago , the Qijianglong was identified by skull and vertebrae fossils unearthed by construction workers in 2006 near Quiang City, China. The dino's neck is extremely long, making up more than half of the creature's 49-foot body. Yi qi, or The Mysterious Bat Pigeon Dinostar Co. Ltd./AP Yi qi is Mandarin for \"strange wing,\" which is appropriate since this tiny dino has totally puzzled scientists . Fossils dating back about 160 million years were discovered in China's Hebei Province and suggest the pigeon-sized creature had wings made of skin, like a bat's, instead of feathers. Scientists can't determine if these creatures flapped, glided or couldn't fly at all. Saurornitholestes sullivani, or The Even More Lethal Velociraptor Illustration: MARY P. WILLIAMS See those smaller dinos harassing a larger -- but helpless -- hadrosaur? That's S. sullivani, a newly identified raptor that is thought to be totally deadly thanks to a powerful sense of smell and its agility. \u201cAlthough it was not large,\" one scientist said, \"this was not a dinosaur you would want to mess with.\" Advertisement Zhenyuanlong suni, aka The Fluffy Chicken From Hell The University of Edinburgh Well-preserved fossils found in China turned out to belong to a close relative of the Velociraptor. They suggest that real Velociraptors (not the \"Jurassic Park\" versions) were feathery and fluffy -- but just as lethal as they've always been known to be. \"The real Velociraptors,\" a paleontologist said, \"would have been feathery, fluffy, winged Chickens from Hell.\" While Zhenyuanlong suni may have had a set of birdlike wings, it was too short to fly and was likely used for show and egg protection. Lightning Claw, aka T. Rex's Little Cousin JULIUS CSOTONYI With 10-inch claws, what else could scientists name this thing? The extraordinary meat-eating dinosaur was discovered in an opal mine in Australia, making its fossils a gorgeous blue color . The 22-foot-long beast was certainly no match for T. rex, but its huge hook-like claws definitely made it ferocious. Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, aka The Arctic Nightowl James Havens Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis were \"truly polar,\" according to scientists. Their fossils were discovered in northern Alaska, which means the large, duck-billed herbivore had the resilience to live in darkness for months at a time and endure the unforgiving environment. Scientists still aren't sure what they did for food during the long, hard winters. Advertisement Hualianceratops wucaiwanensis, aka The Big-Headed Dog Dino Portia Sloan Rollings Fossils found in China suggest the Triceratops had a super-weird relative. \"It was probably about the size of a spaniel dog, with a relatively large head , and walked on its hind legs,\" a paleontologist told HuffPost. H. wucaiwanensis is thought to be the oldest known member of the ceratopsians genus (which includes the Triceratops) and its remains have helped scientists better understand the early evolution of horned dinosaurs. Morelladon, aka The Humpback Sail Carlos de Miguel Chaves Some 125 million years ago, these strange fellows wandered around what is now Spain. Their sail-like humpback stood about 2 feet tall and was likely used to either help regulate heat or to store fat . Most interesting is that these structures appear in many vertebrates throughout history, even those not closely related to each other.

Jupiter's Moon Europa May Be Venting Water Plumes, NASA Says The discovery could hasten the search for alien life. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post and Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Sep 26, 2016, 02:52 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A new mosaic made from images taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990's is shown of the surface of Jupiter's icy moon, Europa. NASA NASA / Reuters Plumes of water vapor appear to be escaping from the surface of Jupiter\u2019s icy moon, Europa, scientists announced today in a dramatic news briefing held by NASA. Evidence of the plumes is visible in recent observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope, William Sparks, an astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said in the briefing. The new report confirms similar observations that were made in 2013. Advertisement We've spotted possible water plumes erupting on Jupiter's moon Europa using @NASA_Hubble : https://t.co/UvnkSeM4D3 pic.twitter.com/oEeBmogSNw \u2014 NASA (@NASA) September 26, 2016 The plumes provide additional evidence that beneath Europa\u2019s icy surface lies a vast underground ocean of liquid water. In addition, they suggest that it might be easier than some had thought to search for signs of life on the moon, which has long been considered one of the likeliest places to find extraterrestrial life in the solar system. \u201cIf there are plumes emerging from Europa, it\u2019s significant because it means we may be able to explore that ocean of Europa for organic chemicals or even signs of life without having to drill through unknown miles of ice,\u201d Sparks said. Advertisement Here\u2019s an artist\u2019s illustration of water vapor plumes erupting from Europa\u2019s surface: Scientists estimate the plumes rise about 125 miles from Europa\u2019s surface before raining back down. If there\u2019s life in the subsurface ocean, it could be brought to the surface by the water jets, becoming visible to a visiting spacecraft. \u201cWho could ask for more?\u201d Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute and a noted expert on the search for extraterrestrial life, said in an email to The Huffington Post. \u201cEuropa, one of the choice locations in the solar system for biology, is possibly offering it up to us on a platter. Rather than sending a lander and a drilling rig capable of making a 10-mile hole in granite-hard ice, all we may have to do is send an orbiter around this intriguing moon, outfitted with a catcher\u2019s mitt. We grab some of that plume, bring it back to Earth, and look for evidence of alien microbes in the comfort of our labs.\u201d Advertisement The live-streamed announcement capped days of intense speculation over just what NASA would reveal at the briefing. Some had wondered if the space agency might announce that alien life had been found. But in the hours leading up to the briefing, NASA threw cold water on that idea, saying \u201cSpoiler alert: NOT aliens\u201d in a pair of blunt tweets, including this one: Today at 2pm ET: We\u2019ll announce new findings from Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa. Spoiler alert: NOT aliens! Listen here: https://t.co/n8fLgFICzs pic.twitter.com/tZFtIYGJLG \u2014 NASA (@NASA) September 26, 2016 Advertisement Europa is one of at least 67 known moons of Jupiter . Scientists have long speculated that its cracked crust hid a vast ocean. In fact, the suspected ocean might hold more water than all of Earth\u2019s oceans combined , The Washington Post reported. \u201cWe know that on Earth, everywhere that there\u2019s water, we find life ,\u201d Robert Pappalardo, a scientist with a planned Europa mission, said in a video released earlier by the space agency. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Hubble Telescope Spots A Double-Bladed Celestial 'Lightsaber' Even the universe is excited about the new \"Star Wars\" movie, it seems. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Dec 17, 2015, 12:46 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT How does one bring down a fully armed and operational battle station ? Maybe try a celestial, double-bladed lightsaber. This celestial \"lightsaber\" spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope was formed by superheated matter ejected from the poles of a newborn star. NASA/ESA NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted the \"lightsaber\" above inside a star birthing ground known as the Orion B molecular cloud complex a mere 1,350 light-years away from Earth -- right here in the Milky Way galaxy. The space agency released a photo of the phenomenon Thursday , just in time for the release of the new \"Star Wars\" film. \u201cScience fiction has been an inspiration to generations of scientists and engineers, and the film series Star Wars is no exception ,\u201d John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. \u201cThere is no stronger case for the motivational power of real science than the discoveries that come from the Hubble Space Telescope as it unravels the mysteries of the universe.\" Advertisement Unfortunately for the Rebel Alliance, it's unclear if the twin jets of energy could be harnessed for the purposes of bringing down the Death Star. Unlike a lightsaber , which derives its deadly force from a contained crystal-powered laser, the matter emitted from the nascent star would probably be too hot to handle. NASA explains : When stars form within giant clouds of cool molecular hydrogen, some of the surrounding material collapses under gravity to form a rotating, flattened disk encircling the newborn star. Superheated material spills away and is shot outward from the star in opposite directions along an uncluttered escape route \u2014 the star\u2019s rotation axis. Shock fronts develop along the jets and heat the surrounding gas to thousands of degrees Fahrenheit. The jets collide with the surrounding gas and dust and clear vast spaces, like a stream of water plowing into a hill of sand. The shock fronts form tangled, knotted clumps of nebulosity and are collectively known as Herbig-Haro (HH) objects . The twin jets that make up this particular \"lightsaber\" are known as HH 24.

In Hawaii, You Can Actually Hear Evolution In Action Show this video to anyone who doubts Darwin. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 18, 2015, 06:30 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT There's a strange quiet on the small, remote Hawaiian island of Kauai that suggests Charles Darwin got it right. There, in order to protect themselves against parasitic predatory flies, crickets have rapidly evolved to ensure their own survival . A field cricket, like those found in Hawaii. Leoshoot Advertisement From the late 1990s to 2003 -- \" just 20 or so cricket generations ,\" according to one study -- male crickets' wings evolved to prevent them from making their signature chirping sound. The mutation, while a challenge for mating, means the predatory flies can't locate them. \"Silence saved their lives,\" says biologist and science writer Joe Hanson in an episode of \" It's Okay To Be Smart .\" \"Not only did we see natural selection in action, it happened in the blink of an eye.\" The video below -- part of an ongoing series called \" 12 Days Of Evolution \" -- is for all your evolution-denying friends out there.

Jupiter's Great Red Spot Glows A Pretty Pink In Luminous New Photo Great Red Spot Shines Pink In Observatory's New Photo By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 11, 2015, 10:24 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Jupiter looks blue and its Great Red Spot takes on a strange pinkish hue in a spectacular new photo released Jan. 15 by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. That's because the photo shows our solar system's largest planet not in visible but in infrared light. (Story continues below image.) The photo was taken July 26, 2012 by a camera mounted on the organization's Subaru Telescope , an 8.2-meter instrument perched atop Mauna Kea volcano on Hawaii's Big Island. Advertisement In addition to the Great Red Spot --actually a swirling storm so vast that three Earths would fit within its boundaries--the photo shows the Jovian moon Ganymede in the upper right. One of more than 60 moons known to orbit Jupiter , Ganymede looks stretched out because it moved during the time required to take the photo. | Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement Close From Our Partner What's Hot More In Science NEWS POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE VOICES HUFFPOST PERSONAL SHOPPING NEWSLETTERS About Us Advertise Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers User Agreement Comment Policy DMCA Policy HuffPost Press Room Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy Consent Preferences Privacy Settings Part of HuffPost Science. \u00a92025 BuzzFeed, Inc.

Study Shows Dogs Exhibit Human-Like Altruism, Especially For Their Friends \u201cGood dog\u201d is getting a whole new meaning. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Dec 17, 2015, 04:21 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Two dogs are seen during a behavioral experiment in Vienna. A donor dog, right, is able to choose whether the dog on the left will receive a treat. MYL\u00c3NE QUERVEL-CHAUMETTE/VETMEDUNI VIENNA A pawsitively endearing behavioral study on dogs has discovered our four-legged friends exhibit human-like levels of empathy and giving toward each other -- but with special preference for ones they know. Man's best friend exhibits an altruistic trait that\u2019s commonly seen in humans and apes called prosocial behavior, according to a study published Wednesday in Nature Publishing Group that researchers say is the first of its kind. Advertisement Ethologists at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna studied dogs\u2019 readiness to help dogs that were both familiar and unfamiliar to them. They divided 16 animals into pairs and designated one dog in each duo as the \u201cdonor dog.\u201d \"In the test, the donor dogs used their mouths to pull a string to bring a tray toward a second dog. They could choose either an empty tray or a tray containing a treat on the partner's side,\" the study\u2019s lead researcher, Friederike Range of the Messerli Research Institute, said Wednesday in a press release. What researchers found was that donor dogs were typically willing to throw their counterpart a bone (figuratively and literally), especially if the two dogs already knew each other. Donor dogs that didn\u2019t already know their partners, however, were less inclined. Advertisement \"Prosocial behavior was exhibited less frequently toward unfamiliar dogs than toward familiar ones,\" Range said. Researchers don't think the unfamiliar dog distracting the donor dog played a role in the latter dog's judgment, Range said. \"Only rarely did a donor dog interact with the unfamiliar dog,\" he explained. The dogs seemed to understand which string would do what, as the dogs were given the option to feed themselves at the end of each series of tests and generally chose the string attached to the treat. Advertisement People have long wondered whether the good-natured attitude of most dogs is inherent or if it has developed after years of humans domesticating them, and Range's research provides some insight into this question. \"Dogs and their nearest relatives, the wolves, exhibit social and cooperative behavior, so there are grounds to assume that these animals also behave prosocially toward conspecifics,\" Range said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

A NASA Engineer Explains How You Give Directions in Space Navigation requires a reference frame. We need reference frames to tell us where we are with respect to other objects and we need reference frames to tell us how we are oriented with respect to other objects. There is no single universal frame that is used for all operations.

How do you give directions in space? : originally appeared on Quora : The best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google+ . Answer by Robert Frost , NASA Engineer with specialization in spacecraft operations, orbital mechanics, and guidance, navigation and control systems Navigation requires a reference frame. We need reference frames to tell us where we are with respect to other objects and we need reference frames to tell us how we are oriented with respect to other objects. There is no single universal frame that is used for all operations. Typically, the reference frame that most simplifies the mathematics and visualization is used for a particular objective. For example, just for the International Space Station (ISS), we use more than 15 reference frames. Advertisement There is a reference frame that is helpful for pinpointing a location within the ISS. It is Cartesian and gives locations with respect to forward and aft, starboard and port, overhead and deck. Another frame is used for structural calculations and gives ISS hardware locations in terms of X, Y, and Z. But since that body frame is with respect to the center of mass of the ISS, it doesn't really help us understand the orientation of the vehicle, so we need an additional frame for that, one that can take that X, Y, Z body frame and describe it as rotations about the local vertical and local horizontal. And, although that frame (LVLH) is great for telling us the vehicle attitude, it isn't helpful for telling us the vehicle location. We need a frame for that, too. Most commonly we use a frame called J2000 to describe the location of the vehicle. J2000 has its origin at the center of the Earth. As the ISS moves forward in its orbit and as its altitude changes because of either decay or thruster burns, J2000 can provide a precise understanding of the ISS location with respect to the Earth, below. It gets a bit more complicated, though. Individual systems and sensors often use their own frames and then the software converts from one to another. For example, GPS provides the ISS location in the CTRS (Conventional Terrestrial Reference System) and the software converts that to J2000 for use by the vehicle GNC software and by the flight controllers. But, now we're getting to the heart of your question. What happens when a spacecraft is no longer in Earth orbit? How do we define its location, then? The answer is to identify the primary body that the vehicle is respondent to. For spacecraft traveling throughout the solar system, the ideal reference frame is one centered on the Sun. But, once the spacecraft is close to its destination (e.g. Saturn), it would make sense to also begin to report coordinates with respect to that body. Advertisement And what about when we leave the solar system? Well, we haven't really done that yet. Although Voyager has technically left the solar system, it still makes sense to describe its location with respect to the Sun. As we move far beyond the Sun, we would need to look for a frame that optimizes the situation. It might make sense to use a frame that is centered on the center of our galaxy, because our Sun, the spacecraft, and whatever star we are going to visit will all be in orbit about the center of the galaxy. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

But, currently we care about how things are located with respect to our solar system. For that, a frame called ICRS (International Celestial Reference System) is commonly used. It is a quasi-inertial frame centered on the barycenter of our solar system. It is maintained by tracking the positions of almost three hundred sources outside our galaxy (e.g. quasars). Advertisement While coordinates of a frame like J2000 are given in cartesian X, Y, Z, a frame like ICRS uses the spherical coordinate system of Right Ascension, Declination, and Distance.

How I Became The NPR Math Guy Most people think that mathematics is just about numbers, but that\u2019s not true at all.

LEAVE A COMMENT ferar via Getty Images Since 1995, Stanford mathematician Keith Devlin has intrigued (and occasionally baffled) listeners to NPR\u2019s popular Saturday morning magazine program \u2018 Weekend Edition \u2019 with Scott Simon, with his discussions of mathematical topics that somehow manage to find their way into the news. It all started by chance (mostly). As a young mathematics graduate student at the University of Bristol in my native England, back at the end of the 1960s, my role models were the mathematicians who had made major mathematical discoveries\u2014mathematical giants such as Leonard Euler, Karl Friedrich Gauss, Pierre De Fermat, and Kurt G\u00f6del. Like many young people starting out on a mathematical career, I dreamt of joining the ranks of the greatest\u2014of proving a major theorem or solving a difficult problem that had baffled the best minds for decades. Advertisement Some of my contemporaries succeeded. In 1963, only a few years ahead of me, the young American mathematician Paul Cohen solved Cantor\u2019s Continuum Problem, a puzzle that had resisted all attempts at resolution for over sixty years. But as happens to the vast majority of mathematicians, eventually I had to settle for far less. During the course of my career, like most of the world\u2019s 25,000 professional mathematicians listed in the International Directory of Mathematicians , I solved a number of minor problems and proved several respectable, but largely unremarkable theorems. I taught at various universities, in Scotland, Norway, Germany, Canada, and the United States (where I moved permanently in 1987), and I wrote a number of textbooks for mathematicians and students. Again, fairly typical career moves for many academic mathematicians, though perhaps I moved around more than many and ended up writing more books than most. But along the way, almost by accident, I discovered another talent, perhaps my true calling: an ability to explain often obscure, advanced mathematical ideas to a general audience. I found that, through my words, I could make mathematics come alive for others not versed in the subject. Advertisement \u201cI found that, through my words, I could make mathematics come alive for others not versed in the subject.\u201d It was an unplanned sequence of events that resulted in my pursuing a second career path as a public expositor of mathematics. In the early 1980s, I grew increasingly frustrated by the fact that magazines and newspapers often carried articles on science\u2014biology, physics, chemistry, and so on\u2014but hardly ever on mathematics. On the few occasions when they did cover mathematics, they did so badly, often getting the main idea entirely wrong. In March 1983, I decided to do something about the situation, and wrote a short piece and sent it in to the British national newspaper The Guardian . A few days later, the science editor phoned and informed me that they could not publish it. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cI like your style. You seem to have a real knack for explaining difficult ideas in a way ordinary people can understand.\u201d He encouraged me to try again, and my second attempt was published in The Guardian on May 12, 1983. Several more pieces also made it into print, eliciting some appreciative letters to the editor. As a result, when The Guardian launched a weekly, personal computing page later that year, it included my new, twice-monthly column Micromaths . The column ran without interruption until 1989, when my two-year visit to Stanford University in California turned into a permanent move to the US. Advertisement I soon discovered that I liked my new found role of \u201cexpositor\u201d. I have always been passionately interested in all aspects of mathematics, and never liked the fact that so many people have a completely false impression of this wonderful subject. Most people think that mathematics is just about numbers, but that\u2019s not true at all. Yes, numbers play an important role in the subject, but mathematics is not about counting. It\u2019s about pattern and structure. It\u2019s about the hidden beauty that lies just beneath the surface of the everyday world. I relished the challenge of constantly trying to find ways to explain new developments in advanced mathematics to the lay readers of my column. The frequent appreciative\u2014and occasionally baffled\u2014letters I received from readers fueled my commitment even more. Encouraged by the success of my column, I began writing books and articles for a general readership, including some for the business world. I also gave lectures to lay audiences, and started to make occasional appearances on radio and television. From 1991 to 1997, after moving to the United States in 1987, I edited FOCUS, the monthly magazine of the Mathematical Association of America, and since January 1996 I have written a monthly column, Devlin\u2019s Angle , for the association. Advertisement Early in 1995, I got the break that led to my becoming a regular contributor to primetime national radio in the US, with the media identity \u201cthe Math Guy\u201d. I got a telephone call one day from National Public Radio\u2019s Saturday morning news magazine show Weekend Edition . The host, Scott Simon, wanted to interview me about the solution to the 350-year-old problem known as Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, which became a major news story after the Princeton mathematician Andrew Wiles had solved it a few months earlier. Never one to say \u201cno\u201d to a new challenge, I trotted off to my local NPR affiliate studio to record the segment. Although Scott and I would not meet for many months\u2014then as now we record most of our interviews with me in a studio in California and Scott at the NPR studios in Washington D.C.\u2014we hit it off immediately over the air. Listeners loved our intimate, humorous banter\u2014which from the start has been completely unrehearsed and spontaneous. Many wrote in to the program to say so. Again, without any planning, I found I had another new role, this time a \u201cradio personality,\u201d appearing on the show every few weeks. Eventually, I acquired my \u201cstage name.\u201d The receptionist at the studio I used soon started to greet my arrival with \u201cIt\u2019s the math guy.\u201d I mentioned this to the Weekend Edition producer one day, and he replied, \u201cOh, that\u2019s what we put you down as on our scheduling board.\u201d And so the NPR Math Guy was born. This post is adapted from the introduction of Keith Devlin\u2019s new book Finding Fibonacci: The Quest to Rediscover the Forgotten Mathematical Genius Who Changed the World , published this month by Princeton University Press . His Math Guy segments, 94 to date, are all available at The Math Guy Sound Archive .

Boaty McBoatface Is Preparing For Its First Antarctic Mission What, you thought it was all just a joke? By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Mar 13, 2017, 11:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Step back world \u2015 Boaty McBoatface is about to make a splash. The famous yellow submarine is set to tackle its first big Antarctic mission, one year after its hysterical name was overwhelmingly selected in a public online poll. The unmanned vessel is being sent to the Southern Ocean where it will probe water flow and turbulence in the Orkney Passage, which is about 2.17 miles below the surface, the Telegraph reported. Advertisement The unmanned submersible known as \"Boaty McBoatface\" is seen hanging from a crane in northern England. The vessel will probe the Southern Ocean's water flow and turbulence. Phil Noble/Reuters \u201cWe will measure how fast the streams flow, how turbulent they are, and how they respond to changes in winds over the Southern Ocean,\u201d lead scientist Professor Alberto Naveira Garabato, from the University of Southampton, told the British news site. \u201cOur goal is to learn enough about these convoluted processes to represent them in the models that scientists use to predict how our climate will evolve over the 21st century and beyond,\u201d he said. Advertisement For those not familiar with Boaty\u2019s unique name, more than 120,000 people originally voted for it to grace a multi-million dollar polar research ship though the name was ultimately given to the small , unmanned vessel igniting global uproar. #BoatyMcBoatface being lowered in to a testing tank at the NOC to prepare it for its next expedition. pic.twitter.com/3KPGdOp7jb \u2014 Oceanography Centre (@NOCnews) March 13, 2017 Officials with the U.K.\u2019s Natural Environment Research Council decided that a more conventional name was more fitting for the research ship: It was named Sir David Attenborough, after the English broadcaster and naturalist. Advertisement \u201cWhatever name was chosen would not only face the scrutiny of the world\u2019s press now, but would need to stand for decades to come as the ship took researchers to the extremes of the Earth,\u201d the NERC said in an article on Monday that once again addressed the name\u2019s selection. \u201cCute though it sounds,\u201d they said of Boaty\u2019s name, \u201cthis unmanned submarine is part of a fleet of some pretty intrepid explorers. This month they\u2019ll begin their first mission, traversing a deep current that originates in Antarctica and flows through the Southern Ocean.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Breathtaking Photos That Capture The Terrible Beauty Of Big Storms Chasing supercells is all in a day's work when this landscape photographer goes where the weather takes him. Alexa Keefe \u2014 National Geographic Sep 23, 2016, 12:18 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This post originally appeared on National Geographic. Photographs by Mitch Dobrowner Landspout | Goodland, Kansas PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER Mitch Dobrowner has a vivid imagination. When he listens to music, he can see colors. And before he goes out to photograph, his mind\u2019s eye already sees an image of what he wants. This time, it was something like a spaceship\u2014the type of storm cloud that takes on a distinctive saucerlike shape. Lightning Strikes | Peckham, Oklahoma PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER His expectations were met\u2014and then some\u2014the first time he found himself facing a supercell storm on America\u2019s northern plains. He and Roger Hill, a veteran storm chaser who\u2019s been his guide ever since, had been following this particular storm for nine hours as it wound its way from Sturgess, South Dakota, through the Badlands, and down into Valentine, Nebraska, gathering force as it went. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was looking at,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was so surreal to me.\u201d He was hooked. Vortex | Long Hollow, South Dakota PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER Advertisement Mammatus | Bolton, Kansas PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER \u201cAfter that I\u2019d just go out, and these [phenomena] kept on happening. I don\u2019t even know if the pictures do justice to what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d For anyone who\u2019s seen Dobrowner\u2019s breathtakingly beautiful images, there\u2019s no doubt that they do. (Case in point: A print of one of his tornado pictures was used as an inspiration for the cyclone in 2013\u2019s Oz the Great and Powerful.) Dobrowner comes from the school of classic landscape photography\u2014think Ansel Adams, large-format film cameras, carefully composed black-and-white exposures. When photographing landscapes, he typically spends a couple of days finding his compositions and waiting for the right light. He can take his time because, as he points out, the rocks aren\u2019t going anywhere. He compares the process of discovering his surroundings to stepping into a darkroom and waiting for his eyes to adjust. White Tornado | Woonsocket, South Dakota PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER Rain Curtain | St. Francis, Kansas PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER Advertisement But with storms, the adjustment has to happen much more quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen when I step out of the van,\u201d he says. For him, it\u2019s more like photographing a sporting event, where you have to act fast or the moment is gone. Also different is the equipment. Shooting digital rather than large-format allows him to both move quickly and preview the images. And he has to maintain his concentration in the face of wind and rain, which also means constantly wiping his lens between shots (and no, he doesn\u2019t Photoshop out the raindrops.) \u201cThe only thing I ever listen for when I\u2019m out is Roger saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get out of here right now,\u2019\u201d he says. But sometimes he also just wants to stop and take it all in. \u201cStorms are like a creation to me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist unless all the elements are just right \u2026 the right humidity, the right winds. If everything\u2019s right they form structure and mature. They feel like living things. No two storms are alike.\u201d Tornado Above Farm | Syracuse, Kansas PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER For a few weeks every summer, Dobrowner travels from his home in Los Angeles to the northern plains, meeting up with Hill and going where the weather takes them. Aside from the adventure of never knowing what he\u2019s going to see next, the true pleasure for Dobrowner comes with being able to share what he sees with others. \u201cI see us as so little in comparison to the universe\u2014on this spinning rock through space,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not here very long, so I just try to photograph how I see the world, and if people relate to that I\u2019m honored.\u201d A few years ago, he took his teenage son out, wanting him to experience the storms for himself, to give him an experience he would never forget. After his son ended up posing in front of twin tornados in Nebraska, he said to his father, \u201cI thought you were kidding\u2014can we get out of here right now?\u201d But he\u2019s still talking about it three years later. \u201cTo me,\u201d Dobrowner says, \u201cthat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Raincloud | Hershey, Nebraska PHOTOGRAPH BY MITCH DOBROWNER You can see more of Mitch Dobrowner\u2019s work on his website .

We're Going To Take A Photo Of A Black Hole We're Going To Take A Photo Of A Black Hole By Zac Thompson, Contributor Outspeak Editor - in partnership with Huff Post Outspeak Editor - in partnership with Huff Post Mar 1, 2017, 07:33 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING It looks like scientists will soon be able to take the first-ever photograph of a black hole . You know, one of those really cool vacuum like holes in space that are often featured in science fiction films. But actually, it\u2019s a region of space where a giant star has collapsed on itself, thus forming a point in the fabric of space/time that becomes super dense. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape it. It\u2019s not hard to understand how the mechanics of a black hole would make it rather difficult to photograph (because there\u2019s no light, ya dingus). However, there\u2019s a new project aiming to achieve that feat called The Event Horizon Telescope . The EHT is a network of telescopes located around the world dedicated to focusing on the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A* , which is 25,000 light years away. Advertisement If we\u2019re getting technical, the photo will really be of the event horizon , not of the black hole itself. No, the event horizon isn\u2019t the bad sci-fi horror movie from the 90s , it\u2019s just a fancy way to describe the boundary of the black hole. This is the space where light and debris and dust swirl before being flushed down the space-toilet that is a black hole. Learning more about the structure of black holes could teach us a lot about how galaxies are formed. But one of the central purposes of photographing the event horizon is to test Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

According to Einstein\u2019s theory, the photo should really look like a crescent of light surrounding the black hole, not unlike the what we saw in Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2014 film Interstellar . Scientists are pretty confident such will be the case, but having photographic evidence could offer further proof that Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity is correct. If not, it will help them learn where his theory breaks down and push them toward new answers.

Ultra-Cheap Microscopes Could Save Millions of Lives The microscope is one of the quintessential symbols of science, invoking images of researchers in white lab coats. Microscopes have been saving lives for decades by helping diagnose any number of deadly diseases, but in many parts of the world, they are in short supply.

By Joni Blecher Joni Blecher is a freelance writer who has spent her career covering tech and a myriad of lifestyle topics. When she's not writing, you can find her exploring the food scene in Portland, Oregon. The microscope is one of the quintessential symbols of science, invoking images of researchers in white lab coats looking for the next big breakthrough. As a kid, you may remember using one to get your first glimpse of paramecium in pond water or to view the cell structure of an onion. Microscopes have been saving lives for decades by helping diagnose any number of deadly diseases, but in many parts of the world, they are in short supply. That's about to change. Technology is transforming smartphones, iPads and even paper into durable, ultra-portable microscopes that only cost a few dollars to make. Advertisement Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory created a small device that clips onto a smartphone or tablet, turning the camera lens into a microscope. They used a 3D printer to create the attachment, which holds an inexpensive glass bead that provides the magnification. Once attached, you can hold a standard glass slide and with the specimen you want to magnify up to the bead and view on screen. There are three lens designs: 100X magnification for viewing salt crystals or the structure of a leaf, a 350X version that can identify parasites in blood (malaria) or protozoa in drinking water (cryptosporidium), and 1000X option that can identify anthrax spores. The blueprint for the attachment is available online , so if you have access to a 3D printer and about a dollar's worth of materials, you can make your own. This 3D-printed microscope for mobile devices can identify parasites in blood. ( Image credit: Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ) Advertisement Dr. Steve Lee, a scientist at Australian National University, has found a way to literally bake microscope lenses in an oven and attach them to smartphones. Think Shrinky Dinks, but using the same material found in contact lenses. To create the lenses, Lee places a drop of gel-like silicone polymer called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on a glass slide and bakes it at 158 degrees Fahrenheit until it's hardened. Lee places another drop of PDMS on the base. The slide is flipped over and baked again, using gravity to form a droplet. More drops can be applied to create the optimum lens shape. When finished, the lens slides into a small frame made by a 3D printer that fits over a smartphone's camera lens. Though not very powerful (only about 160X), it can be used as a skin-examining dermascope to help diagnose diseases like melanoma. This tiny lens costs just a few bucks to create.

( Image credit: Stuart Hay ) Advertisement If a 3D printer and smartphone are out of reach, there's a low-tech option that you can assemble from a piece of paper for less than a dollar. Developed by a research team at PrakashLab at Stanford University, Foldscope is an origami-inspired optical microscope that can provide over 2000X magnification. It comes on a piece of paper, and you simply remove the parts and start folding. There are no written directions, so the design is pretty intuitive. Once assembled, you can use it to view common bacteria and parasites with standard glass slides. All that's needed to make a Foldscope is a sheet of polypropylene paper with the microscope design, a 140X low-mag lens or 2,180X high-mag lens (depending on the application), a 3V button battery, a white LED, an electrical slider, and copper tape. Image credit: Foldscope Team Foldscope's creators say their mission is twofold: to impact science education by enabling the dream that \"every kid in the world should carry around a microscope,\" and to impact global health by developing disease specific instruments that are designed for diagnostics, are extremely robust and extremely easy to use by health workers. The product is currently in beta testing with 10,000 users. To see images and read beta tester's stories, check out the project's blog, Microcosmos .

Watch A NASA Booster Nozzle Plug Get Blown To Bits Fear not, it was all \"intentional.\" By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Sep 19, 2016, 11:41 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This may look bad to the untrained eye, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 NASA says it\u2019s on purpose. The space agency has released slow-motion footage of a June 28 test run in Promontory, Utah, showing a booster for its new rocket, the Space Launch System. The device fires up to a whopping 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit, obliterating the booster\u2019s nozzle plug. Or as NASA calls it , \u201cintentionally breaking apart.\u201d Advertisement The purpose of the nozzle plug is to prevent bad stuff like heat, dust and moisture from finding its way into the booster before it is set off. Following the test, fragments of the plug were found as far as 1,500 to 2,000 feet away from the ignition site. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Two People With Rare Disorder Offer Clues To Humans' Mysterious \u2018Sixth Sense\u2019 Quick, without looking -- do you know where your feet are? By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Sep 23, 2016, 01:13 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Grove Pashley via Getty Images Two people with a rare and little-understood disorder have helped scientists identify a gene that may be responsible for our \u201c sixth sense \u201d of body awareness. In a study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, scientists at the National Institutes of Health describe the cases of a 9-year-old girl and a 19-year-old woman with rare neuromuscular symptoms. Both patients seem to lack proprioception \u2015 that is, an awareness of the position of one\u2019s body in space. When blindfolded, they couldn\u2019t walk or keep their balance. They also couldn\u2019t track the position of their arms and legs without seeing them. Advertisement To understand how naturally this comes to most people, just close your eyes and bring your finger to your nose. Easy, right? Being drunk can temporarily take away your ability to do this. But if the two people in the study closed their eyes and tried to touch their noses, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do it at all. The researchers discovered that the patients had mutations on a gene called PIEZO2, suggesting that this gene contributes to the sense of touch and proprioception. \u201cOur study highlights the critical importance of PIEZO2 and the senses it controls in our daily lives,\u201d Dr. Carsten B\u00f6nnemann, an NIH researcher, said in a statement . \u201cUnderstanding its role in these senses may provide clues to a variety of neurological disorders.\u201d Advertisement The patients were examined by B\u00f6nnemann, who specializes in studying unknown genetic illnesses in children. The woman and the girl both had similar difficulties with walking, coordination and body growth and development. Their symptoms included bent fingers and feet and curved spines. The woman and the girl could each sense pain and temperature, but certain other kinds of touch went almost ignored by their nervous systems. One patient who underwent brain imaging showed no neural activity in response to someone brushing on her palm. She also reported that a gentle brush on her forearm, which feels comforting to most people, felt \u201cprickly\u201d to her. It turned out B\u00f6nnemann and his colleague had zeroed in on a specific gene that was already being investigated in mice at another lab at the NIH. So the two teams of researchers joined up. Advertisement The mutation in the gene appears to block the production of a protein by the same name. This protein is believed to be mechanosensitive \u2015 which is to say it generates nerve signals in response to the mechanical force of touch on the skin, allowing us to sense the touch. \u201cAs someone who studies Piezo2 in mice, working with these patients was humbling,\u201d Alexander Chesler, researcher at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and a co-author of the study, said in the press statement. \u201cOur results suggest [these patients] are touch-blind,\u201d Chesler said. \u201cThe patient\u2019s version of Piezo2 may not work, so their neurons cannot detect touch or limb movements.\u201d Advertisement The woman and the girl appear to compensate for a lack of a sense of touch and proprioception by relying on vision and other senses, the researchers said. The researchers suspect the PIEZO2 gene may also be related to skeletal growth and development. Now that the mutation has been identified in two people, they hope they can more easily find other people who might have it. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It\u2019s also possible that there are other variations of the gene, each one producing different sets of symptoms or simply mild variations in how our bodies develop and how we move about in the world. Advertisement \u201cCould a finely tuned PIEZO2 gene contribute to superior athletic performance, or a poorly tuned one to clumsiness?\u201d B\u00f6nnemann told the journal Science . \u201cI think it\u2019s not impossible.\u201d Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Does This Headline Look Blue To You? Then It Might Also Feel Like A Triangle. Research shows that synesthesia may extend in more directions than we thought. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Sep 17, 2016, 08:01 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT alphaspirit via Getty Images A painter who hears noise in colors . A musician who sees sounds in shapes . People who taste words . These are just some examples of what it\u2019s like to have synesthesia \u2015 a condition where input received via one sense triggers a response from another sense, causing people to experience reduced boundaries between vision, hearing and other types of perception. Now, a study published Sept. 15 in the European Journal of Neuroscience suggests that simply having one type of synesthesia \u2015 for example, seeing colors in letters of the alphabet \u2015 is enough to blur the lines between other senses as well. Advertisement \u201cIt shows that something about their synesthesia is spilling over into another domain,\u201d Dr. Krish Sathian, a neurologist at Emory University, said in a press release. The findings may help researchers pin down the exact cause of synesthesia, which remains mysterious. Are the brains of people with synesthesia wired differently from everyone else\u2019s? Or are they simply ordinary brains doing what ordinary brains do, only more intensely? We don\u2019t yet have enough data to say for sure, but the new research suggests it may be the latter. Most people, even those without synesthesia, make some implicit associations between different sensory features. We describe people\u2019s voices as \u201csharp\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d as if they\u2019re things we can touch. Or we talk of painting a room in \u201cwarm\u201d colors. Advertisement One famous example of these so-called cross-modal correspondences is the Bouba-Kiki effect, first observed by the psychologist Wolfgang K\u00f6hler in 1929. Experiments have shown that no matter what language someone speaks, he or she is more likely to assign the name \u201cbouba\u201d to a round-cornered shape and the name \u201ckiki\u201d to an angular shape than the other way around. \u201cSome argue that these phenomena form a continuum, with classical synesthesia being an exaggeration of universal cross-modal correspondences,\u201d the researchers note in this week\u2019s paper. \u201cOthers contend that the two are quite different.\u201d This picture is used as an example to show that people, regardless of their language, tend to attach certain sounds to certain shapes. In one study, American students and Tamil speakers in India both called the angular shape on the left \"kiki\" and the curvy one on the right \"bouba.\" Drawn by Andrew Dunn CC BYSA 30 Advertisement The people in the study had the most common form of synesthesia \u2015 a type known as grapheme-color synesthesia , which causes people to perceive colors in letters and numbers. But during tests, the researchers found that these people are also more likely than their non-synesthete peers to make associations between shapes and meaningless words. \u201cWe conclude that synesthesia heightens universally experienced cross-modal correspondences,\u201d the researchers said. Advertisement Synesthesia is thought to be rare, but estimates are highly variable and unclear. Anecdotally the condition has been linked to creativity, with some research backing it up. One study in Australia found 24 percent of synesthetes to be involved in an artistic profession. Among the general population, this figure falls to just 2 percent. It may be possible to learn synesthesia , by consciously trying to associate different sensory modalities, to improve your memory and creativity. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

And some researchers argue that true synesthetes, too, have learned the associations during childhood. One study last year found a link between the colors that some people see in letters and the colors of a popular brand of refrigerator magnets .

Massive Filament Snakes Over Half A Million Miles Across Sun's Surface Massive Filament Snakes Across Sun's Surface By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 12, 2015, 12:59 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Why so sad, sun? NASA's Solar Dynamics (SDO) spacecraft has spotted the sun looking like a frowny face, thanks to a massive, dark line snaking across the sun's surface . Just check out the image below, which was snapped on Feb. 10, 2015. (Story continues below image.) A solar filament, seen as a dark, snaking line across the lower half of the sun, hovers above the sun's surface. Advertisement The line, called a \" solar filament ,\" is 533,000 miles long when stretched out--that's longer than 67 Earths lined up, according to NASA. Solar filaments are clouds of cool, dense gas floating above the sun's surface, held in place by the sun's magnetic field. They can last for several days or weeks until they collapse, or erupt-- triggering what scientists call \"coronal mass ejections, \" in which solar material is hurled into the sun's atmosphere or space. This \"mosaic\" image, captured on Feb. 12, 2015, shows the sun and the filament in multiple wavelengths. Advertisement SDO celebrated its fifth anniversary Wednesday, having launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla. on Feb. 11, 2010. To date, it has taken more than 200 million images of the sun.

Here's How Humans Evolved To Be Really Efficient Sleepers We've got shut-eye down pat. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post and Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Dec 16, 2015, 01:30 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Humans evolved to get better sleep in less time, scientists say. Peter Augustin via Getty Images Humans have evolved the ultimate life-hack: we get better sleep in less time than most of the animal kingdom. We not only get significantly less shut-eye than our animal relatives , we're also more efficient at it because we spend more time in deep than light sleep, according to a new study by researchers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Advertisement Less sleep may have allowed humans to devote time to learning skills and forging social bonds, whereas deeper sleep may be critical for sharpening and enhancing cognitive abilities. \"Humans are a unique species and given the intuitive concept that our sleep is linked to how we think, feel and behave, I was less surprised and more excited about the findings that support the idea that sleep has played a part in the evolution of our species,\" Dr. David Samson, an evolutionary biologist at the university and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post. The researchers compiled a database of sleep patterns among hundreds of mammals, including humans and 21 other primate species, such as chimpanzees and baboons. Then, the researchers conducted a statistical analysis of their data and found that humans are the shortest sleepers of all the primates, snoozing for an average of about seven hours a night. Most primates get between 14 and 17 hours of shut-eye. Advertisement The researchers concluded that humans are able to rest less because they get more rapid-eye-movement, or REM, sleep per hour than do other species. About 25 percent of our time sleeping is spent in this deeper, more relaxed mental state, compared to only 5 percent in other primates. Scientists aren't sure why humans evolved to make the most of sleep. One hypothesis is that the advent of artificial light \"tricked\" our biological clocks into sleeping less, but the researchers think that a shift towards a shorter and more efficient snooze may be linked to humans sleeping on the ground instead of in trees, as our early human ancestors probably did. \"Certain prerequisites have to be met in one\u2019s sleep environment to have deep sleep because when you are in it you are less easily aroused, and thus more vulnerable,\" Samson said. Advertisement \"This vulnerability would have been life threatening in the wild, if not for early humans living in larger groups, controlling fire (which keeps you warm and repels predators small and large) and sleeping consistently on stable, terrestrial sleeping surfaces,\" he added. \"All these elements working together could have removed previous barriers in attaining the kind of high quality sleep humans are characterized by today.\" The study was published in the journal Evolutionary Anthropology on Dec. 12.

What Is the Science Behind Hypnosis? Hypnosis is a real phenomenon, and even animals can be hypnotized. But what hypnotism is, exactly, remains unclear. In a remarkable experiment reported in the New York Times [1], subjects were given the post-hypnotic suggestion that they would see words that would appear incomprehensible as if in a foreign language.

What is the science behind hypnosis? : originally appeared on Quora : The best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google+ . Answer by Paul King , Computational Neuroscientist Hypnosis is a real phenomenon, and even animals can be hypnotized. But what hypnotism is, exactly, remains unclear. In a remarkable experiment reported in the New York Times [1], subjects were given the post-hypnotic suggestion that they would see words that would appear incomprehensible as if in a foreign language. They were then put in a brain scanner and asked to perform the \"Stroop task\" in which one reads aloud the color of words but not the text. Advertisement Here is an example Stroop task shown in English and Dutch. When the words are in a foreign language, the task is easy. When they are in your native language, it is almost impossible to do correctly (try it!) due to an \"interference effect\" that causes the meaning of the words to take priority over their visual color. However with the post-hypnotic suggestion, subjects were able to do this task effortlessly. Not only that, but the fMRI brain scan revealed that the brain region responsible for language did not become activated. So not only did the words \"seem\" to the subject to be in a foreign language, the brain actually processed them as if they were. This experiment may be the first solid evidence that hypnosis is a real neurological phenomenon. But what kind of phenomenon is it? This is where the controversy begins. Hypnosis is generally regarded as an altered state of consciousness, a broad category that includes meditative states, the \"flow\" state, psychedelic drug-induced states, and psychosis. But since consciousness isn't understood, alterations to it aren't very well understood either. Advertisement More specifically, hypnosis is a state of extreme \"suggestibility,\" a phenomenon that includes the placebo effect, advertising, and religious cults, but may also include any context-specific behavior. If a stranger at a train station asks you to take off your clothes, you would call the police. But if a stranger wearing a white coat at a hospital makes the same request, you would comply naturally. Have you been hypnotized? Hypnotism may simply be the artful manipulation of attention, language, and context to establish an alternate set of temporary beliefs, which then influence perception and behavior. The hypnotic induction procedure generally involves three components: direction of attention, unusual use of language, and tests. The direction of attention determines what will or will not enter perceptual awareness. The unusual use of language can divide consciousness, so that suggestions are made indirectly while reasoning and skepticism is distracted. The tests are tasks used to create the illusion that the subject has surrendered control to the hypnotist, thereby causing the subject to surrender more control. For example the hypnotist may say your eyelids feel heavy, so that when you feel it, you believe that you are now hypnotized, which causes you to become more hypnotized. Advertisement Many trance levels have been identified. In some models, there are more than 30 distinct \"trance depths\" from lightly suggestible to the ability to forget words, not see an object, see something change color, not notice pain, or \"fall asleep\" on command. While a stage hypnotist can persuade someone to do something embarrassing, it is generally understood that people will not act against their own value system. Hypnotic effects do not always require a formal induction procedure. Milton Erickson, perhaps the most effective hypnotherapist who ever lived [2], was once treating a boy who came i to the hospital E-R needing stitches on his forehead. Rather than using anesthesia, Erickson explained to the boy how he would sew up the wound if he were to do it. He explained what he would do in great detail, gesturing around the boy's head and going through the motions. The boy became impatient and asked him when he was going to start. Erickson replied that he had already finished.

If Aliens Call, We Might Not Want To Answer, Says Stephen Hawking Listen up, NASA. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Sep 23, 2016, 08:55 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Stephen Hawking has said it before and he\u2019ll say it again: If extraterrestrials call, do not answer \u2015 at least, not without careful consideration. The renowned theoretical physicists hosts \u201cStephen Hawking\u2019s Favorite Places,\u201d a new short film available on the streaming service Curiosity Stream. The film follows Hawking around the universe as he \u201ctravels\u201d in a computer-generated imagery spacecraft, giving the audience a peek into simulations of a black hole and Gliese 832c , an earth-like planet outside our solar system that scientists believe may be able to support life. Advertisement And Gliese 832c isn\u2019t even the closet possible second-Earth. In August, scientists announced that Proxima b , a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri \u2014 the nearest known star to our sun \u2014 has a temperature that could allow liquid water and is possibly habitable. But if we ever get a signal from any of these places, Hawking warns that we shouldn\u2019t be too eager to say hello. \u201cWe should be wary of answering back,\u201d he says in the film, according to USAToday. \u201cMeeting an advanced civilization could be like Native Americans encountering Columbus \u2014 that didn\u2019t turn out so well.\u201d Advertisement It\u2019s an idea Hawking has expressed numerous times before \u2014 typically using human beings as an example of why we shouldn\u2019t trust other intelligent life. \u201cWe only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn\u2019t want to meet,\u201d he told The Times of London in 2010. \u201cI imagine they might exist in massive ships, having used up all the resources from their home planet. Such advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads, looking to conquer and colonize whatever planets they can reach.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Now We Know How Many Licks It Takes To Reach The Center Of A Lollipop Now We Know How Many Licks It Takes To Reach The Center Of A Lollipop By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 10, 2015, 01:12 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT How many licks does it take to reach the center of a lollipop ? A new mathematical model formulated by scientists at New York University and Florida State University pegs the answer at 1,000. That number is an estimate for a one-inch lollipop, and it holds true only if the tongue does its job without any help from the teeth. Advertisement \"Our model assumes no biting!\" Dr. Leif Ristroph, assistant professor of mathematics at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the study's senior author, joked in an email to The Huffington Post. Lollipop licks might sound like pure whimsy, but the study had its serious side. Its aim was to describe in detail the process by which flowing water shapes and ultimately dissolves materials--a process of considerable interest to scientists in fields ranging from chemical engineering and pharmacology to geology. (Story continues below image.) Diagram of the apparatus used in the study. For the study, which was published online Jan. 26 in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics , the scientists immersed different shapes of hard candy in flowing water. Then they used time-lapse photography to record changes in the candy. Advertisement They found that the water turned the candy into a consistent shape no matter its initial shape or the speed of the water current. Ristroph called it \"smooth and rounded on the flow-facing side\" and \"gnarly with little bumps and divots\" on the backside. \"We call this shape a 'sculpture'--dissolved by the flow--and its shape gave us the clues to how dissolution works and how to model it mathematically,\" Ristroph said in the email. Ristroph went on to point out that the researchers made their own lollipops for the study--and that some of the lollies wound up not in the water tunnel but, inevitably, in the scientists' mouths. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Being A Cynic Has A Significant Downside, New Study Shows Want To Make More Money? Try Changing Your Attitude, Scientists Say By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jun 2, 2015, 12:28 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Being a cynic comes at a pretty high cost -- literally as well as figuratively. A cynical worldview has been linked with poor physical health as well as reduced psychological well-being and marital trouble . And according to new research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, cynics may earn less than their idealistic peers . The study showed that cynics -- who tend to question other people's motives and believe that humans are fundamentally self-interested -- often have lower incomes. Advertisement Why? Cynical people are more likely than others to be distrusting and to avoid cooperation, and they also tend to devote more resources than necessary to protecting themselves and their assets from exploitation. They may also be less likely to ask for help from others. \"Employees who believe others to be exploitative and dishonest are likely to avoid collaborative projects and to forgo the related opportunities,\" Olga Stavrova, a psychology researcher at the University of Cologne in Germany and one of the study's authors, told The Huffington Post. People who hold a more benevolent view of human nature, in contrast, may be more likely to benefit financially from opportunities to join forces with others. Advertisement The researchers conducted a series of studies to demonstrate a correlation between cynicism and income losses. In the first two studies, the researchers analyzed longitudinal surveys of American adults, and found high levels of cynicism -- as assessed by personality questionnaires -- were correlated with lower income levels years later. A third study investigating a nationally representative sample of 16,000 Germans showed that less cynical people earned roughly $300 more per month than their more cynical counterparts, controlling for other factors. The takeaway: If you want to be more financially successful -- and maybe a little happier, too -- try giving people the benefit of the doubt. Advertisement \u201cOccupational success and economic prosperity represent important life goals for many people, and promote life satisfaction and psychological well-being,\u201d Stavrova said. \u201cOur findings may help people in achieving these goals by encouraging people to adopt a more benevolent and idealistic view of human nature and a trustful attitude towards their peers,\" she added. \"We believe that adopting a more idealist, open perspective toward other people will typically not result in exploitation and deceit but is likely to (literally) pay off.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

How Sleep Can Help Us Get Rid Of Deep-Rooted Stereotypes Here's A Trick That May Help People Become Less Racist & Sexist By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 31, 2015, 09:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have long known that sleep boosts the brain, helping us consolidate memories and learn new things . Now, a provocative new study shows it may even have the power to help us reverse deeply rooted stereotypes against women and African-Americans -- a finding which has important implications given the state of race relations in America , and the gender gap in math and science. Advertisement \u201cThese biases are well-learned,\" Dr. Xiaoqing Hu, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of the study, told The Guardian. \"They can operate efficiently even when we have the good intention to avoid such biases . Moreover, we are often not aware of their influences on our behavior.\" Disturbing biases measured. For the study, the researchers recruited 40 white men and women between the ages of 18 and 30 and had them complete a task called the Implicit Association Test (IAT), which measured their baseline gender and racial biases. Then, the participants completed two \"counter-stereotype trainings,\" which involved looking at different faces -- black and white, male and female -- paired with words on a computer screen (see diagram). Advertisement The participants were asked to press a button labeled \"correct\" when female faces appeared next to science and math words, and when black faces were paired with positive words like \"cheer, smile, or honor.\" When the participants identified these pairings quickly and accurately, two specific sounds were played -- one sound for the \"women-science\" pairing, and one for the \"black-good\" pairing. Just a few zzz's. After the training, the participants took a 90-minute-long nap. Once they fell into a deep sleep, the researchers played one of the two sounds repeatedly. When the participants woke up, they took the IAT again. Advertisement What happened? Participants' biases fell by more than 50 percent for the bias associated with the sound they heard while asleep. For instance, if participants heard only the \"women-science\" sound, their gender bias was reduced -- but their racial bias stayed the same. The participants were tested again a week later, and they continued to be less biased -- although at a lower rate of around 20 percent, according to Hu. \"It is somewhat surprising that the sleep-based intervention could have an impact that was still apparent one week later ,\" Hu said in a written statement. \"The usual expectation is that a brief, one-time intervention is not strong enough to have a lasting influence.\" Advertisement In the real world. Hu and her colleagues think these interventions could be applied to reduce other biases too, such as those related to religious affiliation, sexual orientation, political preference, weight, and disability. But more research is needed to find out whether these interventions can change behavior in the real world. \"We didn't have people interact with or make decisions about other people, so that sort of experiment is needed to know the full effects of the methods we used,\" Dr. Ken Paller, director of the cognitive neuroscience program at Northwestern University and one of the researchers, told BBC News. \"But we suggest that modifying unconscious social bias is likely to influence the extent to which decisions are influenced by racist or sexist attitudes .\" He added that if the interventions can affect decision-makers, it raises the question of \"whether people in positions of authority in society, such as judges and police officers, and perhaps people who make hiring decisions, should have their unconscious bias evaluated and perhaps trained to some standard.\" Advertisement Unethical tampering? Scientists who were not involved in the research find the study's results encouraging, but some believe that conducting such experiments while the participant is asleep also raises ethical concerns . As Dr. Gordon Feld and Dr. Jan Born, psychologists at the University of Tubingen in Germany, wrote in a commentary on the study, it involves tampering with people while they are in \"a state... without willful consciousness and therefore vulnerable to suggestion.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Monsanto, RoundUp and Junk Science Last weekend demonstrators joined a March Against Monsanto in some 428 cities in 38 countries, including more than 240 cities in the U.S. alone. What exactly has so many people riled up? Monsanto, of course.

Last weekend demonstrators joined a March Against Monsanto in some 428 cities in 38 countries, including more than 240 cities in the U.S. alone . What exactly has so many people riled up? Monsanto, of course, is an agrichemical and biotech giant, responsible for more than 90 percent of the traits in genetically engineered corn, soy and cotton sold worldwide . The company is a flash point for those who oppose the technology. But now a new issue has emerged. Monsanto's herbicide glyphosate -- trade name RoundUp -- which is used on most genetically engineered crops (also known as GMOs), is sparking new and serious concern, not just among GMO opponents but among health and environment experts globally. There is good reason to be concerned with glyphosate and its widespread use on GMO crops. When they were first being introduced in the early 1990s, biotech companies said GMO crops could do many things -- produce more nutritious food, resist climatic stress, reduce pesticide use, and confer many other benefits. But, in fact, the characteristic most widely engineered into crops was the ability to withstand RoundUp. This was a win-win for Monsanto -- they could sell the engineered seeds, and also sell the weed killer the seeds were designed to withstand. Since this greatly simplified weed control, farmers embraced the seeds and glyphosate use. Today, 90 percent or more of the corn, soy, canola, sugar beets grown on U.S. cropland are varieties that have been engineered to tolerate glyphosate. Advertisement Not surprisingly, glyphosate use has increased vastly. In the period between 1996 and 2011, during which GMO crops were introduced into U.S. agriculture, these crops increased herbicide use by 527 million pounds. Use of glyphosate on just two crops, corn and soy, has increased almost 17-fold between 1996 and 2012, from roughly 12.5 million pounds to 210 million pounds. So what's the problem here? Glyphosate (RoundUp) has long been touted as virtually harmless. EPA doesn't even bother to test for residues in food, having decided years ago they pose little risk. But studies to the contrary have gradually been accumulating, and in March of this year, 17 experts from 11 countries meeting at the World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), unanimously agreed to re-classify glyphosate as \"probably carcinogenic to humans\" ( e.g. Group 2A ). The Chair of the IARC committee was Dr. Aaron Blair, formerly the top scientist on pesticides and cancer at National Cancer Institute . Monsanto has called the IARC findings \"junk science,\" as the findings differ from the assessment of regulatory agencies in the U.S. and EU. However, IARC, unlike the regulatory agencies, looks at all the available studies in the scientific literature and does not ignore or downplay studies performed on the formulated product and/or which do not follow narrow testing protocols. Advertisement The response to IARC's findings in other parts of the world was immediate. Colombia halted the spraying of glyphosate as part of their coca eradication program. Bermuda and Sri Lanka banned imports of glyphosate products, and Germany's state consumer protection ministers called for \" the supply to and use by private persons to be banned for precautionary reasons .\" Health risks are not the only new concern. The vast increase in herbicide use associated with GMO crops, virtually all due to glyphosate (RoundUp), has also caused a substantial increase in glyphosate-tolerant weeds, dubbed \"super weeds\" by some. A survey of farmers in 2012 found that almost half of U.S. farmers had glyphosate resistant weeds on their farms, up from 34% in 2011 . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Widespread use of glyphosate on engineered crops throughout the Corn Belt also appears primarily responsible for a large decline in Monarch butterfly populations because the herbicide eradicates milkweed, on which the butterfly depends for food. In response to a petition from environmental organizations, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department is considering whether to place the Monarch butterfly on the Endangered Species list . Advertisement The biotech industry's primary answer to the super weed problem so far has been to develop crops (corn and soy) that are resistant to other herbicides such as 2,4-D and dicamba. But some scientists think these are even more toxic than glyphosate . Next week IARC will meet to discuss, in part, whether to changes the carcinogenicity classification of 2,4-D and related herbicides, and perhaps determine that they are \"probable human carcinogens.\" Stay tuned. Whether you march against Monsanto or not, there are clearly new safety concerns -- the cancer risks -- and environmental impacts -- superweeds and Monarch losses -- linked to Monsanto's herbicide. They demand serious consideration by regulators.

Meet The Real-Life Astronomer Who Inspired Jodi Foster's Character In 'Contact' This Real-Life Alien Hunter Inspired The Main Character In 'Contact' By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post May 31, 2015, 09:16 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A re we alone in this vast cosmos? That's the burning question that drove Dr. Eleanor Arroway -- a fictional astronomer in Carl Sagan's book \"Contact,\" who was played by Jodi Foster in the 1997 film adaptation -- on her epic quest for extra-terrestrial life. And it's also motivated the career of Dr. Jill Tarter , the real-life astronomer said to have inspired Arroway's character. Advertisement (Story continues below image.) Jodi Foster as Dr. Eleanor Arroway in the film \"Contact.\" Tarter retired in 2012 after spending 35 years scanning the skies for alien signals, and more than a decade as director of the Center for SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Research in Mountain View, Calif. But she's still actively involved in the search for life -- and is encouraging the next generation of E.T. hunters. To learn just what Tarter is up to now, and find out what's motivated her to keep up the hunt, HuffPost Science emailed her a series of questions. Here, lightly edited, are her answers: What makes you sure that alien life is out there? I'm not sure. This is a question that we are trying to answer. It is as legitimate to ask of the universe, \"Is life ubiquitous, or singular?\" as it is to ask \"How did it all begin?\" \"How will it end?\" and \"Are there other universes?\" During my own career, the discovery of extremophiles and exoplanets have made the universe appear more bio-friendly, but that is not the same as saying that biology, and life-as-we-don't-yet-know-it exist beyond the Earth. This question will only be answered by exploration. That is what SETI is trying to do -- and we do not know the answer. Advertisement \"If they can get here, then they are far more technologically advanced than we are, and the reality is that they will set the rules of the game.\" What got you interested in the search for life? The Cyclops Report from 1971 -- written by Barney Oliver and John Billingham -- was the result of a series of summer studies at NASA Ames and Stanford. In reading that workshop report, I was impressed by the notion that after millennia of asking priests and philosophers what to believe about life beyond Earth, the middle of the 20th century presented us with some tools that permitted scientists and engineers to do experiments to try to find the answer. Telescopes, rather than belief systems, could potentially show us what is, rather than what others said we should believe. I realized that I was in the right place, at the right time, with the right skills (undergrad degree in engineering physics and Ph.D in astronomy) to join this exploration. I got hooked, and have stayed hooked all these years. NASA's chief scientist predicts we'll find alien life within the next decade. Do you agree? Ellen Stofan, as NASA spokesperson, was talking about finding microbes somewhere in the solar system beyond Earth. It's a bet that I'd take, but again that's not the same thing as knowing the answer. As for any potential mathematicians out there, NASA has excluded those searches from its astrobiology program. Doesn't make logical or scientific sense, but it is a political reality. Why do you think we haven't found it yet? Many reasons: -- We don't yet have the right tools, and/or may not yet know the right things to look for (applies to microbes and mathematicians). -- \"Beyond Earth\" is vast beyond human comprehension, and we haven't yet looked in the right places in the right way. -- We have already done so, but not recognized it. -- One of two versions of Clarke's Third Law : Any sufficiently advanced technology will be indistinguishable from magic. Or, any sufficiently advanced technology will be indistinguishable from nature (this due to Karl Schroeder). What's kept you going over decades of not finding life? Does it get disappointing? Only the interactions with politicians and funding agencies is disappointing. The discoveries in the realms of exoplanets and extremophiles continue to excite. Our ability to search in different ways continues to improve (now at exponential rates). The question grows more, not less, important as time goes by. Advertisement At what point do we give up the hunt? Only after searches have been systematic and inclusive enough that null results become significant -- a long way from where we are today. Practically, when humanity in all its forms of government, corporate, or private reaches a threshold of pain or indifference and is no longer willing to fund the exploration. Should we beam out our own signals into space, for potential aliens to find? The book SETI 2020 suggested that since we are such a young, emerging technology, we should listen first, and transmit only after we've become an older, stable technology capable of undertaking very long-term projects such as transmitting. Not all of my colleagues agree with this. What will happen if aliens find us before we find them? Whatever they dictate. That sounds ominous. Stephen Hawking has warned that aliens might want to conquer Earth and enslave us. Do you worry about that? Advertisement Not necessarily ominous, just a reality check. If they can get here, then they are far more technologically advanced than we are, and the reality is that they will set the rules of the game. As to what their intentions might be -- I'm not competent enough to say (and neither is Stephen Hawking, as smart as he is) -- extraterrestrial psychology is a field without any experts. \"I grew a tough skin, and after being \"one of the boys\" for decades, finally woke up and started trying to support other females around me and under me.\" NASA and other organizations want to go to Mars. Should we? And what do you think about setting up a colony there? Advertisement The dinosaurs did not have a space program. Humanity is a single-point of failure as long as they occupy only one planet. Spreading beyond Earth is a good strategy for longevity. It is however, no guarantee if we take all our old habits with us. You've spent decades working in a male-dominated field. What was that like? Has science become more welcoming for women? Yes, science has become more welcoming, but there is still a long way to go. Fortunately the worst offenders are dying off, and from what I can see of the younger generations of scientists, both males and females are adopting an attitude of partnership and shared responsibility towards life and work. That's a good thing, because there is growing evidence that postponing childbirth until the mother gains tenure, or partnership, or whatever goal of security/seniority, a strategy that was adopted by many of my generation and the baby-boomers, has led to significant rise in rate of learning and other disorders in offspring. Advertisement What was it like? I grew a tough skin, and after being \"one of the boys\" for decades, finally woke up and started trying to support other females around me and under me. What's your role in the search for life, now that you're retired? Attempting to raise the money to keep the searches going as long as may be necessary; something I did not succeed at while I was Director. I don't want to lose the next generation of clever scientists and engineers willing to take a chance on SETI, but unwilling to jeopardize their ability to support their families. Roller coasters are only fun as rides in amusement parks, they are a real drag in the world of funded research. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

As we all know, your work inspired Ellie Arroway's character in \"Contact.\" What did you make of the movie? Advertisement \"Contact\" was a fantastic movie. It has now been out there so long, that I experience many young colleagues who tell me that this movie was what inspired them to go into science. That's the best endorsement I can think of! We need a Contact II. In the movie, Arroway gets into a pod and travels through a series of wormholes, not knowing if she'll make it back. Given the opportunity, would you get into that pod? Yup, in a heartbeat.

NASA Captures Incredible 'Blooming' In Atlantic Ocean Mother Nature dazzles again. Courthouse News Dec 15, 2015, 12:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT NASA image by Norman Kuring, using VIIRS data from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (CN) - NASA has unveiled a satellite photo showing a phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic, taken in late September. Each spring, the waters of the North Atlantic host a huge natural bloom of phytoplankton - microscopic plant-like organisms that are not only key for carbon cycling but may also influence clouds and climate. Advertisement Blooms also occur in fall, but weather and clouds make capturing a satellite photo of them difficult. But on Sept. 23, the weather was good enough in the North Atlantic for the infrared imaging system on the Suomi NPP satellite to take a photo of a bloom. \"The image does a beautiful job of showing the close link between ocean physics and biology,\" said Michael Behrenfeld, a phytoplankton ecologist at Oregon State University. \"The features that jump out so clearly represent the influence of ocean eddies and physical stirring on the concentration of phytoplankton pigments and, possibly, colored dissolved organic matter.\" Advertisement NASA sent researchers to the area to make ship- and aircraft-based measurements in hopes of understanding the annual cycles of ocean plankton and their relationship with atmospheric aerosols, the agency said. The first leg of the five-year study ended Dec. 1. This story was originally published by Courthouse News .

Changing How We Study Political Divisions Just Might Help Us Heal Them Our democracy may depend on it. By Sarah DiGiulio On Assignment For HuffPost Mar 14, 2017, 05:01 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING To determine if a drug works, medical researchers don\u2019t just rely on lab results. They do studies to collect data on how actual people respond to treatment in real life. A group of political scientists want to apply this same real-life approach to their field in an effort to better understand (and heal) politically divisive moments like the one we currently find ourselves in. Advertisement What\u2019s missing from traditional political science research, they argue in the latest issue of the journal Science, is the essential question of how the agents of democratic systems \u2015 in other words, citizens and politicians \u2015 interact and engage with one another. Understanding this process would help politicians better meet the needs of their constituents and turn all those complaints being raised in town hall meetings into real policy changes. Without this kind of research, politicians may lack the tools and skills to mend America\u2019s political divisions over crucial matters like health care, jobs and education. The Huffington Post spoke with Michael Neblo, associate professor of political science at the Ohio State University and co-author of the Science article, to learn more about how people like him do this type of research. Advertisement Constituents in Clemson, South Carolina, disagree with Sen. Lindsey Graham during a town hall meeting on March 4. Sean Rayford/Getty Images What is your primary criticism of today\u2019s political science research? Right now, there are really two kinds of research. One is basic research, fundamental inquiry about how to make democracies and non-democratic states work. And on the other hand, you have research in public policy that addresses very specific types of policy questions. It\u2019s not that either of those are bad by any stretch. The problem is that the bridge between those two is very narrow, and there\u2019s not a lot of support between them. Advertisement So what\u2019s missing? What type of political science research or work needs more study and attention? Our own research [for example] addresses basic questions about persuasion in democratic politics, but does so in a way that is intended to help members of Congress do a better job of representing their constituents. Who shows up? How do citizens become informed about politics? Who changes their minds and why? What ends up happening is quite a bit of the basic research gets done without an orientation toward its potential policy implications, and a lot of policy work gets done at too much of a distance from what we know about the basic mechanisms and institutions of politics. Researchers don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to draw the connections out. Did your research answer that question about how members of Congress can better represent their constituents? Advertisement So we did experiments pairing real sitting members of Congress with their constituents in [electronic] town halls that we ourselves designed. We found that if we can prompt people to think about themselves in their roles as citizens along with other citizens, then they answer questions as if the question is \u201cWhat should we do together ? \u201d \u2015 [as opposed to] a lot of standard public opinion polling that isolates people and prompts people to answer a question in terms of \u201cwhat do I want.\u201d [The town halls we designed] prompted more of a republican (with a small \u2018r\u2019) government, where people were engaged substantively on the issues to inform democratic practice. Advertisement A lot of that has been crowded out of political life as the country has grown and congressional districts have grown and the complexity of the problems we are facing has grown. It\u2019s harder to get to this level of direct interaction between elected officials and their constituents. Members will meet with their constituents occasionally \u2015 in Washington, in their districts or in town halls. But town halls [tend to] primarily be about constituents airing out grievances or rallying support. And the difference between that emphasis can be profound in how people behave. Their expressions of opinions, their rationale, their tolerance with disagreement and their willingness to learn all shift. House Speaker Paul Ryan (right) and then-Rep. Tom Price celebrated anti-Obamacare legislation in January 2016. A year later Americans are yelling at each other over health care. Al Drago/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images Advertisement But there\u2019s still politics in politics. How would having more \u201cbridging\u201d research actually help make it less divisive? Recently a lot of the applied political science work has been done primarily in the areas of campaigns and elections. We\u2019ve learned a lot in political science about how to persuade people and how to motivate people to vote. And a fair bit of that research has rolled out into campaigns and elections. It undergirds the strategies that elected officials and candidates use to win their campaigns. Part of what we\u2019re calling for is to use that knowledge also in the service of government \u2015 so not just for getting into power, but for using that power. How do you do a better job of representing your constituents while you\u2019re in office? The ideal is [for research] to provide insights for good government, not just good election strategies. Advertisement Is there a real-life example where this type of research could help make some of the interactions happening now less fractured? The disruptive protests at town halls where Democratic constituents are engaging with Republican members. There\u2019s room for angry protests in American politics. The Constitution guarantees the right to address the government for redress of grievances. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Advertisement We believe that we can and should find room for other sorts of interactions between elected officials and their constituents that are more rational, in-depth, and a form of engagement that involves a certain kind of reciprocity rather than just drawing battle lines. Most of us won\u2019t actually be doing the political science research you\u2019re calling for. What can we learn? How can we become more informed? There is something available beyond scripted interactions and screaming at each other. It\u2019s not that angry protest is a bad thing. But if that\u2019s not for you or you want something else, that something else is available. Advertisement We\u2019re trying to help members of Congress to be able to do much more of this [on a larger] scale in order to engage with their constituents substantively. From the constituent\u2019s point of view, ask that from your members. Ask for these substantive, in-depth, focused, one-issue forms of interactions. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Pluto Got Its Giant Frozen Heart Over time, the heart might actually have a \"beat.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Sep 21, 2016, 05:07 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING One of the first things NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft spotted on Pluto was its gigantic heart feature. Now, scientists believe they know how it formed. The dwarf planet\u2019s heart-shaped region is actually a whole lot of ice sitting at the bottom of a basin almost 2 miles deep in the Tombaugh Regio, which was named for astronomer Clyde Tombaugh , who discovered Pluto in 1930. Advertisement \u201c The heart shape is to a large degree created by highly volatile nitrogen ice that unavoidably accumulates in the basin and forms a permanent reservoir of ice ,\u201d Tanguy Bertrand, lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature, told ResearchGate. Bertrand and his fellow researchers ran computer simulations of Pluto\u2019s climate over the past 50,000 years and found that, over time, the basin trapped nitrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. Since the atmospheric pressure was highest at the bottom of the basin, the nitrogen condensed into ice. \u201cWith our model, we also predict that atmospheric pressure is currently at its seasonal peak and will decrease in the next decades, while seasonal methane frosts will disappear,\u201d Bertrand told ResearchGate. Advertisement That change could cause the heart-like feature to act like a real heart. \u201c The half-heart glacier lying inside is a really massive glacier , which is not impacted by the seasonal changes. It probably formed when the basin formed, and will remain there in the future,\u201d Bertrand told Gizmodo. \u201cHowever, it probably flows and retracts over a few hundreds of kilometers (like a heart beating) with time, eroding and shaping the mountains surrounding it.\u201d Related NASA Pluto new horizons pluto heart Relive The Pluto Flyby With This Brilliant 16-Second Animation NASA Spots Snow On Pluto's Mountain Peaks Amazing Image Shows Pluto's Frozen Canyons Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

NASA Unveils New 'Dark Side' Of The Moon Video So This Is What The Far Side Of The Moon Looks Like By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Feb 6, 2015, 03:43 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The moon just might be one of the most familiar sights of all -- but you've never seen quite it like this before. NASA has just released a new look at the moon's far side , once known as the \"dark side\" of the moon, along with Earth looming in the background. Using mapping data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , the video shows the phases of the moon as seen from the other side. Advertisement \"Just like the near side, the far side goes through a complete cycle of phases,\" NASA explains. \" But the terrain of the far side is quite different . It lacks the large dark spots, called maria, that make up the familiar Man in the Moon on the near side.\" The far side contains craters of all sizes, as well as what NASA says is \"one of the largest and oldest impact features in the solar system,\" the South Pole-Aitken basin, which covers the bottom third of the moon. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Dolphin Conversation Caught On Tape For First Time Does this mean they have their own human-like language? By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Sep 13, 2016, 09:54 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Some scientists have poured cold water over a Russian study that suggests dolphins have their own language in which they can hold conversations with each other. Zoonar RF via Getty Images A study claims to have recorded a previously unknown language between dolphins it describes as akin to human speech \u2015 but not everyone\u2019s convinced. Researchers say they made an audio recording of two black sea bottlenose dolphins named Tasha and Yana emitting unique pulses and whistles that \u201cmost likely\u201d formed words and sentences. Advertisement The dolphins at the Karadag Nature Reserve in Russia were even described as pausing and listening to one another before responding, according to the study, published last month in the St. Petersburg Polytechnical University Journal. \u201c\u2026the dolphins took turns in producing pulse packs and did not interrupt each other, which gives reason to believe that each of the dolphins listened to the other\u2019s [pulses] before producing its own,\u201d the report states. \u201cEssentially, this exchange resembles a conversation between two people.\u201d It goes on to say that the \u201cfundamental difference between the dolphin exchange of information and the human conversation is in the characteristics of the acoustic signals of their spoken language.\u201d Advertisement \u201cEssentially, this exchange resembles a conversation between two people.\u201d\u201d - Study out of the St. Petersburg Polytechnical University Journal The issue of dolphins communicating with each other through sounds has been raised before. Whether they have a secret language , however, has long divided scientists. Dolphin Communication Project director Dr. Kathleen M. Dudzinski, who has studied the behavior and communication of the marine mammals since 1990, argues that more is needed for the verbal exchanges to be deemed a language. Advertisement \u201cThis is an interesting study,\u201d she said of the Russian report in an email to The Huffington Post on Monday, \u201cbut the described experiment does not show that dolphins are transmitting complex semantic information to each other like what we see for human language.\u201d Dudzinski said the study instead showed similarities between dolphin communication and human language, which has long been seen. \u201cThere are a number examples of this in the scientific literature. However, the current weight of evidence suggests that dolphins do not have a language that functions in the same way as human language,\u201d she continued. \u201cThus, we feel this recent publication is not really a novel item and is unlikely to gain much traction with scientists/academics.\u201d Advertisement \u201cThe current weight of evidence suggests that dolphins do not have a language that functions in the same way as human language.\"\u201d - Dr. Kathleen M. Dudzinski, director of the Dolphin Communication Project One such article Dudzinski believes backs her argument is a 2013 piece published in the International Journal of Comparative Psychology, titled \u201cAre Conversations Between Dolphins and Humans Possible?\u201d The article addresses how communication and conversation aren\u2019t always the same thing. Justin Gregg, a senior research associate with the Dolphin Communication Project, similarly examined such a discussion in a 2006 article titled, \u201cDo Dolphins Have A Language?\u201d Advertisement \u201c\u2026yes, language is a form of communication, but communication can happen in so many different ways \u2015 not just through language,\u201d he stated. Gregg went on to point out physical gestures and vocalizations used among animals, and humans, for communication, which don\u2019t necessarily form a language. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Researchers studying dolphin communication in 2007 reported distinguishing nearly 200 different whistles from bottlenose dolphins. Some of the sounds were linked to specific behaviors. That led the lead researcher, Liz Hawkins, to conclude that dolphins do have their own language. Advertisement \u201cThis communication is highly complex, and it is contextual, so in a sense, it could be termed a language,\u201d she told New Scientist at the time.

Twitter Agog Over Ben Carson's 'Hippocampus Drilling' Tale Wrong, wrong and ... wrong, say scientists. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Mar 7, 2017, 12:06 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Ben Carson: I could drill a hole in your head, stick electrodes in your hippocampus & have you recite verbatim a book you read 60 years ago pic.twitter.com/y0NZUgzu1v \u2014 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 6, 2017 Here\u2019s an interesting idea: Drill into someone\u2019s hippocampus and add a few electrodes so they can recite an entire book verbatim that they\u2019d read decades ago. That\u2019s the brave new world, in the words of neurosurgeon-turned-Housing Secretary Ben Carson. Carson explained his intriguing process during a pep talk with agency employees Monday. (Keep in mind this is the same speech in which he compared slaves to immigrants. ) Advertisement The brain, he said, in a convoluted argument against government aid , \u201cremembers everything you\u2019ve ever seen, everything you\u2019ve ever heard. I could take the oldest person here, make a hole right here on the side of the head and put some depth electrodes into their hippocampus and stimulate, and they would be able to recite back to you verbatim a book they read 60 years ago. It\u2019s all there. It doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d But, said brain and memory experts, do not try this at home. \u201cIt\u2019s utter nonsense,\u201d Dan Simons, a psychologist at the University of Illinois who specializes in memory, said in an email to Wired . \u201cWe can\u2019t recall extended text verbatim unless we deliberately memorized it for that purpose (certainly not books we happened to read 60 years ago), you can\u2019t trigger accurate recall of detailed memories with an electrode (and long-term memories aren\u2019t stored in the hippocampus), we don\u2019t store a perfect and permanent record of our experiences (it\u2019s not all there just waiting to be probed), and you can\u2019t just \u2018learn how to recall it.\u2019\u201d Whew, was there nothing right about what Carson said? No matter. the Twitterverse went absolutely bonkers over his first official federal speech. Ed Yong, science writer for The Atlantic, got the ball rolling: Advertisement This is not how memory, the hippocampus, electrostimulation, or speech works. https://t.co/VO5Vh74hSK \u2014 Ed Yong (@edyong209) March 6, 2017 @edyong209 @BraddJaffy It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a neurosurgeon or\u2026 oh god \u2014 Jacob Harris (@harrisj) March 6, 2017 @edyong209 but is it how housing works? \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Vinny Mang (@vinnymang) March 6, 2017 Advertisement @edyong209 @mark_barr you cannot make a memory omelet without breaking a few skulls. \u2014 John McGraw (@mcgrawfeathers) March 6, 2017 @edyong209 @GabbyBirkman he's obvs caught that new disease trumpliaritus \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 smdh \ud83d\ude29 \u2014 Rae (@RaetheVirtualPA) March 7, 2017 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

SpaceX To Send Two Private Citizens Around The Moon In 2018 Elon Musk just doesn't quit. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 27, 2017, 04:56 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING WASHINGTON \u2014 SpaceX announced Monday that it plans to send two private citizens on a trip around the moon in 2018. The passengers, whose names haven\u2019t been released, have already paid a \u201csignificant deposit\u201d for the trip, the California-based company said in a statement. Advertisement \u201cLike the Apollo astronauts before them, these individuals will travel into space carrying the hopes and dreams of all humankind, driven by the universal human spirit of exploration,\u201d SpaceX said. \u201cWe expect to conduct health and fitness tests, as well as begin initial training later this year.\u201d Fly me to the moon ... Ok https://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 27, 2017 The mission will utilize a Crew Dragon spacecraft and a Falcon Heavy rocket , both of which are still in development. The space tourists are expected to lift off from the same Kennedy Space Center launch pad used by NASA for its Apollo lunar missions. Advertisement \u201cThis presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years and they will travel faster and further into the Solar System than any before them,\u201d SpaceX said. \u201cDesigned from the beginning to carry humans, the Dragon spacecraft already has a long flight heritage. These missions will build upon that heritage, extending it to deep space mission operations, an important milestone as we work towards our ultimate goal of transporting humans to Mars.\u201d The trip is will last approximately one week and cost the space tourists \u201cat least tens of millions of dollars,\u201d Mashable reports. Other private citizens have already expressed interest in this type of trip, and SpaceX says it expects additional lunar missions to follow. Advertisement Monday\u2019s announcement comes roughly a week after SpaceX\u2019s successful launch and landing of a Falcon 9 rocket Kennedy Space Center\u2019s launch pad 39A. That mission, its first from the historic pad, carried a Dragon ship full of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station. Astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent just shy of a year aboard the International Space Station , was among those who took to Twitter on Monday to volunteer himself for a future moon orbit. It's been almost a year. Send me! https://t.co/D60djGh7IZ \u2014 Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) February 27, 2017 Advertisement In September, SpaceX founder Elon Musk revealed his plans for building a self-sustaining Martian colony of 1 million people. To get there, SpaceX plans to build a massive \u201cInterplanetary Transport System,\u201d capable of carrying about 100 people \u2015 and perhaps many more in the future \u2015 plus luggage and other cargo. In December 2015, the company made history with an epic vertical landing of a Falcon 9 rocket on land, just six miles from where it took off at Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was a moment Musk called \u201c revolutionary \u201d and a \u201ccritical step along the way to being able to establish a city on Mars.\u201d In March, the company completed the incredibly challenging task of landing its 14-story rocket booster on a drone ship at sea. Four previous at-sea landings had ended in flames . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The company\u2019s most recent and dramatic failure occurred Sept. 1, when a Falcon 9 burst into flames on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Musk called it \u201c the most difficult and complex failure \u201d the company has had in its 14-year history. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the planned SpaceX lunar mission will launch from Cape Canaveral. It will lift off from the nearby Kennedy Space Center.

An Eerie, Jupiter-Like Storm Is Raging On This Distant Star This giant whirlwind has lasted for two years already. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Dec 14, 2015, 04:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A team of astronomers has recently discovered that a small star sitting some 53 light-years away just may be Jupiter's doppelganger. Well, kind of. The star not only appears to be around the same size as the gas giant planet in our solar system, but it also has a strange and stormy dark spot on its surface (pictured above) that's mysteriously similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot . While planets have been known to have cloudy storms that appear as spots , this new discovery is the best evidence yet that stars can have the same thing, according to a statement released by NASA last week. Advertisement Now, the astronomers plan to seek out other stormy stars in order to determine whether the cloudy spots are common or not. \"We know this newfound storm has lasted at least two years, and probably longer,\" Dr. John Gizis, physics and astronomy professor at the University of Delaware and lead author of a paper describing the star, said in the statement. \"We don't know if this kind of star storm is unique or common, and... why it persists for so long.\" The star, named W1906+40 , was first discovered in 2011, and for the past two years, Gizis and his colleagues have been observing its storm using data from NASA's Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes. Advertisement The astronomers found that W1906+40, which belongs to a class of celestial objects called L-dwarfs, has a temperature of around 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit and rotates on its axis about every nine hours. Earlier in their observations, the astronomers noticed that the star can be quite moody and release stunningly powerful flares . Their latest paper describing the star and its stormy atmosphere was published in The Astrophysical Journal on Nov. 4. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Best Astronomy Photos Of 2016 Are Simply Stellar See for yourself! By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Sep 16, 2016, 04:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The Baily\u2019s beads effect seen from Luwuk, Indonesia, during the total solar eclipse of March 9, 2016. Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016/\u00a9 Yu Jun (China) A dramatic photo of the total solar eclipse on March 9, 2016, has earned top honors in the Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition this year. Scroll down to see a gallery of winning photos. The composite image spotlights a phenomenon known as Baily\u2019s beads , in which \u201cbeads\u201d of sunlight peek around the dark disc of the moon during a total solar eclipse. The picture beat out submissions from thousands of amateur and professional photographers from more than 80 countries \u2015 and earned Chinese photographer Yu Jun a 10,000-pound ($13,000) prize. Advertisement \u201cThis is such a visually striking image, with its succession of fiery arcs all perfectly balanced around the pitch black circle of totality,\u201d Dr. Marek Kukula, the public astronomer at the Greenwich Royal Observatory in England and one of the judges of the competition, said in a news release . \u201cIt\u2019s even more impressive when you realize what it shows: the progress of a solar eclipse, all compressed into a single frame with consummate skill and precision.\u201d Now in its eighth year, the photo competition is run by the observatory in association with the London-based asset management firm Insight Investment and BBC\u2019s Sky at Night magazine. Advertisement Other top images in the contest include a colorful composite of the star Sirius and a picture of the moon that shows its rugged terrain in detail not seen in many conventional photos of our natural satellite. The photos will be on display at the observatory\u2019s Astronomy Centre from Sept. 17, 2016, through June 28, 2017 \u2015 but you can just scroll down here to see some of the best. From Maurolycus to Moretus Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 A close-up view of the lunar landscape littered with craters and craterlets largely forged by the impact of meteors and asteroids. \u00a9 Jordi Delpeix Borrell (Spain) City Lights Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 Star trails highlighting the movement of the Earth gently arc over the towering buildings in the bustling Quarry Bay neighborhood of Hong Kong. The light pollution in Hong Kong means that only a few stars are generally visible in the night sky, but this photo shows you can still engage in some stargazing wherever you are in the world. \u00a9 Wing Ka Ho (Hong Kong) Binary Haze Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 A misty morning in October on the Isle of Wight resembles an eerie scene from a science fiction film. The weather accentuates the brightness of Venus and the crescent moon. \u00a9 Ainsley Bennett (UK) Advertisement Iridis Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 This composite image compares spectroscopy of two planetary nebulae \u2013 the Cat\u2019s Eye Nebula above and the Ring Nebula below. Spectroscopy is used to analyze objects like stars and nebulae. It involves splitting the light from an object into individual colors, like when white light passes through a prism to form a rainbow. This image shows that different parts of the two nebulae give off different types of light. \u00a9 Robert Smith (UK) Large Magellanic Cloud Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 The Milky Way\u2019s close neighbor, the Large Magellanic Cloud, showcases stars of all ages within its 14,000-light-year diameter. The Large Magellanic Cloud can sometimes be seen with the naked eye from the southern hemisphere, but it looks like a faint cloud rather than a huge galaxy. \u00a9 Carlos Fairbairn (Brazil) Lunar Reversal Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 This innovative image of the moon has been inverted to bring out the intricate details of the rugged lunar landscape that we often miss in more traditional shots of our natural satellite. Veins and \u201csplash marks\u201d from the impacts of asteroids and meteorites are easily observed around the crater Copernicus. \u00a9 Brendan Devine (USA, age 15) Advertisement M94 Deep Space Halo Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 Discovered in 1781, Messier 94, or M94, is a distant spiral galaxy lying approximately 16 million light-years from Earth. It\u2019s notable for its two-ringed structure. The shimmering pinks of the inner ring show star-forming activity. The photo also captures the often unseen galactic halo of M94, which is made up of stars, hot gases and dark matter. \u00a9 Nicolas Outters (France) Serene Saturn Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 Saturn, the second largest planet in our solar system, appears with its famed rings. Storms are visible across the gas giant\u2019s face, as is the mysterious \u201chexagon\u201d at its north pole. \u00a9 Damian Peach (UK) The Rainbow Star Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 The brightest star in our sky, Sirius, is often seen as a shining white star. But it can also flash with numerous colors as a result of turbulence in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The photographer, who had been searching for the best way to display these hues, finally hit upon the idea of videoing the star and then picking out the frames with the most striking colors. \u00a9 Steve Brown (UK) Advertisement Twilight Aurora Insight Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2016 On the evening of the total solar eclipse of March 20, 2015, the people of Spitsbergen, Norway, were treated to a second natural light show in the form of the Aurora Borealis. At the time the photo was taken, the sun was shining 9 degrees below the horizon, meaning it was evening nautical twilight on the shore of the Greenland Sea. The Adventtoppen Mountain, standing 2,579 feet tall, towers in the background, as the Northern Lights spread across the night sky. \u00a9 Gyo\u0308rgy Soponyai (Hungary) | Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement Close From Our Partner What's Hot More In Science NEWS POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE VOICES HUFFPOST PERSONAL SHOPPING NEWSLETTERS About Us Advertise Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers User Agreement Comment Policy DMCA Policy HuffPost Press Room Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy Consent Preferences Privacy Settings Part of HuffPost Science. \u00a92025 BuzzFeed, Inc.

SpaceX Launches Rocket From NASA Pad In Florida, Completes Re-landing The rocket, which launched at 9:39 a.m. EST, carried a cargo ship with about 5,500 pounds (2,500 kg) of supplies and experiments for the International Space Station. Irene Klotz Feb 19, 2017, 10:59 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket disappears into clouds after it lifted off on a supply mission to the International Space Station from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 19, 2017. (REUTERS/Joe Skipper) Joe Skipper / Reuters By Irene Klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A SpaceX Falcon rocket blasted off on Sunday from a Florida launch pad once used to send NASA astronauts to the moon, a step forward for billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and his company\u2019s goal of ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station. The 229-foot tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 soared off a seaside launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:39 a.m. ET carrying a Dragon cargo ship bound for the station. Advertisement Nine minutes after blastoff, the main section of the rocket flew back to a landing pad at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, the eighth successful touchdown for Space Exploration Technologies Corp. \u201cBaby came back,\u201d Musk wrote on Twitter, celebrating the re-landing, which came a day afterSpaceX decided to delay the mission 13 seconds before launch due to concerns about the steering system in the rocket\u2019s upper stage, the company said. Sunday\u2019s launch was the first for SpaceX from Launch Complex 39A, originally built for the 1960s-era Apollo moon program and later repurposed for the space shuttles. Advertisement The pad was last used for the final space shuttle launch in 2011. In 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to use pad and has spent millions remodeling it. The launch was also SpaceX\u2019s first from Florida since an accident in September heavily damaged what had been the company\u2019s prime site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, located just south of the NASA spaceport. Last month, SpaceX resumed flying its Falcon 9 rockets using a second launch pad in California, where the first stage of the rocket also nailed its re-landing. Advertisement The company plans to reuse the rockets, slashing costs and allowing it to offer reduced pricing. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which hired SpaceX to fly cargo to the station after the shuttle program ended, closely monitored the launch to learn more about the company\u2019s operations before it clears the company to fly NASA astronauts on SpaceX rockets. SpaceX and Boeing Co are scheduled to begin flying crew to the station by the end of 2018. A Government Accountability Office report last week said both companies face technical hurdles that likely will delay their programs. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Maybe Coin Tosses Aren't Entirely Random After All Maybe Coin Tosses Aren't Entirely Random After All By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 8, 2015, 10:08 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The results of a coin toss are random--or so we thought. But a provocative new video from YouTube's Numberphile series turns that conventional wisdom on its head. The video maintains that the ratio of getting heads vs. getting tails isn't 50/50. It's more like 51/49--with the coin more likely to come up the same way it started. So you're more likely to get heads if the toss starts out with heads face-up, and tails if the toss starts with tails facing up. Advertisement Dr. Persi Diaconis, a professor of statistics and mathematics at Stanford University, arrived at those odds in a 2007 study in which a high-speed video camera was used to analyze a series of coin flips. \"I don't care how hard you flip the coin, you can flip it to the moon,\" Diaconis says in the video. \"That bias is a provable, stable bias.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Obscure terms like \"sphygmomanometer\" and \"ankylosing spondylitis\" can be tricky to pronounce even for those who do have a background in medicine. What hope is there for the rest of us? In the video above, you can watch so-called \"regular,\" as in non-medical, people, try to sound out -- and utterly mangle -- words like these, and also guess what they mean.

Asteroid Impacts 3.3 Billion Years Ago Caused Earth's Oceans To Boil Disaster Movies Are Tame Compared To What Happened 3.3 Billion Years Ago By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost May 28, 2015, 05:43 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Don't complain too much when temperatures rise this summer, because it used to be worse. A lot worse. Some 3.3 billion years ago, monster asteroids -- in some cases bigger than Rhode Island -- repeatedly slammed into the Earth with impacts so violent that air temperatures soared to 932 degrees Fahrenheit for weeks at a time, according to a new study published in the journal Geology. Advertisement Temperatures rose to such extreme levels that the oceans literally boiled, causing sea levels to drop by about 330 feet. Yet somehow, early life managed to survive. \u201c These impacts would have a profound influence on any life trying to evolve into more complex, low-temperature organisms ,\u201d geologist Donald Lowe of Stanford University, who led the research, told Science News. \u201cThey\u2019d keep getting whacked by these giant impactors and driven to extinction or near extinction.\u201d Lowe and study co-author Gary Byerly of Louisiana State University made the discovery while examining the Barberton Greenstone belt in South Africa, where ancient rock is exposed. Advertisement There they found evidence that the Earth was hit by eight monster asteroids ranging in size from about 12 miles wide to about 60 miles wide over the space of 250 million years, Ars Technica reports. By comparison, the asteroid commonly blamed for the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs was \"only\" about 6 miles wide. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Study Says Meditation Could Protect The Brain From Signs Of Aging Study Says Meditation Could Protect The Brain From Signs Of Aging By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 6, 2015, 04:38 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Meditation is good for the brain. A new wave of research has connected the ancient practice to many cognitive benefits, from greater attention and focus to reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression to improved cognitive control and executive functioning . According to a new study from the UCLA Brain Mapping Center , meditation may also protect the aging brain. Researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles and Australian National University found that the brains of longtime meditators were less affected by aging than the brains of those who don't meditate. Advertisement The brain begins to decline in the 20s , and continues to decrease in volume and weight through old age. Meditation, in addition to boosting emotional and physical well-being at any time in life, may be an effective way to prevent neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as help stave off some of the normal cognitive decline that comes with aging. The strategy is free, and it comes with no side effects. The new study builds on 2011 research from the same team, which showed that people who meditate exhibit less age-related atrophy in the brain's white matter, material that makes up nearly half of the brain and is composed of nerve fibers that the brain uses to communicate. In this study, researchers looked at the link between meditation and the preservation of gray matter, the tissue where cognition occurs and memories are stored. They examined the brains of 100 participants, 50 people who had been meditating for an average of 20 years and 50 non-meditators. Both groups were made up of 28 men and 22 women between the ages of 24 and 77. Advertisement The participants' brains were scanned using fMRI technology. While both groups showed a decline in gray matter with older age, longtime meditators experienced smaller reductions in gray matter volume than those who did not meditate. It seemed that gray matter, in those who meditated, was better preserved. \"In meditators, this relation between gray matter loss and age was not as pronounced,\" study co-author Dr. Florian Kuth told The Huffington Post. \"Surprisingly, it was not as pronounced in many regions throughout the brain. What we expected was to see this in just a few small regions ... but what we saw was almost the entire brain. That was a big surprise.\" While the findings don't prove causality -- personalities, lifestyle factors and genetic brain differences may also play a role -- they are certainly promising. The next step for this research would be a longitudinal study tracking the brains of a group of meditators and non-meditators over many years to examine changes that occurred as a direct result of years of meditation, Kuth said. Advertisement And at a time when Americans are living longer than ever before but experiencing higher rates of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative disorders, the research is an important reminder that mindfulness can exert a long-lasting influence on brain health. \"If these are replicated results, this will be a really big deal,\" said Kuth. \"This could make a huge impact.\" The findings were published online in the journal Frontiers in Psychology .

Republicans Just Don't Get Climate Science, And Here's Proof This video mashup will make you laugh... and cry. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Dec 14, 2015, 06:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Now that the world has a climate agreement, will Republican U.S. representatives and presidential candidates stop spewing false science? A new video (above) from Americans United For Change , a progressive advocacy group affiliated with the White House, doesn't make us feel too confident. The video features presidential candidates, including tycoon Donald Trump , Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). It also features Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who famously brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to show that the planet couldn't possibly be warming. Advertisement \"You know what this is? It's a snowball that's just from outside here, so it's very very cold out,\" said Inhofe, who denies humans' role in climate change. \"Man can't change climate.\" Oof. The science-denying statements of 2016 presidential candidates like Trump and Cruz are particularly baffling, as a poll in March showed 72 percent of likely 2016 voters want climate change action from the U.S. government.

There's A Virus For That. New gene-editing techniques could lead us to a post-pill era. By Lila Shapiro Senior Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post Dec 14, 2015, 08:13 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Peter Dazeley via Getty Images More than 3.5 million Americans today live with autism, a condition without a cure. But that's not to say that children with autism don\u2019t take medication. According to a survey by the National Institute of Mental Health, more than half of children with autism ages 6 to 17 are on one or more more drugs normally given for disorders like anxiety, depression, psychosis or hyperactivity. But what if there was a way to treat these children without ever making them take another pill? This is one of the more intriguing ideas to come out of the genetic revolution spurred by the discovery of a gene-editing technique called CRISPR-Cas9, a method that allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA sequences in any living organism, human or otherwise. Researchers are already using this technique in a vast range of projects, from creating mildew-resistant wheat to reversing mutations that cause blindness. In China, scientists have used CRISPR to edit human embryos, an announcement that set off an explosion of ethical concerns. (The scientists used embryos that could never have been brought to term, and fewer than half the embryos were edited successfully.) We are probably still years away from scientists being able to correct genetic flaws in human embryos. But what might come sooner is the ability to treat or cure diseases in children and adults, perhaps by injecting them with a CRISPR-equipped virus that will be able to correct whatever genetic defect contributes to a given disease. Advertisement At the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT, scientists are using CRISPR to try to better understand -- and ultimately, develop cures for -- brain diseases and mental illnesses that have eluded us until now. \u201cI see some glimmers of promise on the autism horizon,\u201d Robert Desimone, a professor of neuroscience and the director of the McGovern Institute, told The Huffington Post. \u201cThis is opening up all kinds of possibilities for both understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and then targeting that pathology for new treatments.\u201d HuffPost spoke with Desimone this week about the possibilities and challenges of the new technology, and about how CRISPR could lead us to what he calls a post-pharmaceutical age. Advertisement Let\u2019s start with the basics. Where are we now when it comes to CRISPR, brain diseases and mental illness? In the last few years, the biggest advance that\u2019s been made in understanding the basis of all forms of mental disorders has been in genetics -- identifying risk genes for all the major psychiatric disorders. And that is opening up all kinds of possibilities for both understanding the pathophysiology of the disease -- what\u2019s going wrong in the brain -- and then targeting that pathology for new treatments. So that\u2019s the greatest opportunity. The greatest challenge is, how do you go from genetic knowledge to these new treatments? Because you\u2019re talking about genetic vulnerabilities that may affect the development of the brain, but they may be expressed only years later. Take schizophrenia, where everyone thinks it\u2019s a developmental disorder and something's going on in the womb, but then you may not see anything until the person is 20 years old. There\u2019s a lot going on there. You want to understand what\u2019s going on at a cellular level, but then there\u2019s also the need to understand how all these cells work together. The brain is not just individual cells, doing their thing. It\u2019s all these cells working together. Advertisement CRISPR\u2019s impact is potentially across the board. It went from nothing just a few years ago to being a tool that\u2019s in everyone\u2019s toolbox. I mean, everyone is now incorporating it into whatever it is they\u2019re doing, all the way from cell-based models up through therapeutics. Before CRISPR, when people were trying to understand brain diseases, what tools did you have for identifying the diseases and developing treatments? There have been different tools available, but they all had major limitations. Typically, they\u2019re limited to manipulations of one gene, whereas with CRISPR-based methods, you could potentially manipulate many genes. And one of the things we\u2019ve understood about psychiatric disorders is that in most cases, most diseases do involve multiple genes. Advertisement And then there\u2019s the question of how you could study these genes. With animal models, all animal models were based on certain lines of mice that had unique properties that allowed you to manipulate their genomes. CRISPR has expanded that to any species. And even within mice, it offers many advantages. What are the implications of that -- the fact that now we can manipulate the genome of any species? That\u2019s one of the reasons that the National Academy of Sciences formed a committee to consider the ethical implications of CRISPR. Because when I say it can be used in any species, that includes humans, and there is a fear that people will start human embryo manipulations. I would say a huge majority of scientists and clinicians think that it would be way premature at this stage. So I anticipate the National Academy will issue some strong advice, and a moratorium on the use of CRISPR in human embryos. And that\u2019s not to say it will be a ban in the future, but until the risks are better understood, and until the technology is further developed, and until we have a chance to really work through all the ethical implications, there will be a lot of pressure to keep this out of human embryos. But in other animal models, it could potentially be applicable in any of them, and in very powerful ways. It can be done quickly, it can be done cheaply. Advertisement How could you potentially use CRISPR to understand or treat something like depression, or other kinds of mental illnesses? Of all the psychiatric diseases, depression has probably got one of the least strong genetic components. There are a lot of purely environmental effects that lead to depression in people, whereas with something like autism and schizophrenia, the genetic contribution is a lot higher. So for one, if you can identify a genetic cause of the disease, then you start looking at targeting the cause. If there\u2019s something going wrong at the cellular level, you can target the receptors of cells, like how we do using common drugs, or you could potentially target the DNA of the cell that gets at a deeper level of some of these regulatory functions. There\u2019s a whole range of things you can do using genetic tools to manipulate how cells work. Advertisement Or let\u2019s say you have someone who has no genetic vulnerabilities, but as an adult, they are subjected to something traumatic -- let\u2019s say, abuse -- that leads to depression further down the road. There\u2019s a lot of interest in identifying the genetic regulatory changes that are taking place in cells in response to the abuse that leads to the depression. Now you\u2019re talking about something CRISPR could well be used for. So we might begin to understand how our cells react to trauma, and use CRISPR to somehow combat that? Yes. How cells are affected by trauma, and ways that we might influence cells to negate those effects. It could be that whatever therapeutics eventually come out could be potentially based on CRISPR. Advertisement In your mind, what\u2019s the most exciting way that CRISPR could be used on the brain, and to combat mental illness? These are really early days, and the methods themselves are changing month by month. With Feng Zhang here [the molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, who is one of the scientists credited with developing the CRISPR method], he comes into my office telling me about some new advance literally every month. I don\u2019t know what CRISPR is going to be doing six months from now, because everything Zhang tells me, I haven\u2019t even imagined. Here, Feng Zhang is working on creating autism models, and I\u2019m pretty excited about how that project is going. It\u2019s a little early to talk about, but I see some glimmers of promise on the autism horizon. Advertisement What would these treatments be like? They could be, for example, a virus that you would give the person that would carry genetic material ... Feng has developed a smaller version of a cas9 enzyme that can fit in a common virus that\u2019s used in gene therapy, and so that would be one possibility. Wouldn\u2019t that be interesting, that if someone had autism, you would give them a viral injection and they might never have to take a drug after that? Some people are talking about what could potentially become the post-pharmaceutical age, where the treatments that we have don\u2019t necessarily look like pills that you take every day. How would that injection work? The very simplistic idea is that the virus would be created so that when you inject it into the person's bloodstream, it carries the relevant genome-editing machinery into the cells, so that it corrects the genetic defect that contributes to the disease. Were people thinking about this idea before CRISPR -- the post-pharmaceutical age? CRISPR stimulated it. The idea has been around for quite a long time. But CRISPR has opened new avenues. Advertisement But I think that people have to be concerned about not over-hyping. Don\u2019t over-promise, don\u2019t over-hype, don\u2019t lead people to think that cures are just around the corner. We can\u2019t underestimate -- it\u2019s going to be a real struggle scientifically to make the kind of progress that\u2019s been stalled for so many years. A lot of these disorders, there hasn\u2019t been a new treatment for decades. It's not going to change overnight. But we have a new promising direction.

How Online Interaction Shapes Everything From Baby Name Trends To Revolutions How Online Interaction Shapes Everything From Baby Name Trends To Revolutions By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 6, 2015, 12:13 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT In 1914 , the names \"Mary\" and \"Helen\" were all the rage for baby girls. In 2014 , it was \"Emma\" and \"Olivia\" -- neither of which were even among the top eight girls' names just 15 years earlier. How does a large population come to a consensus about which names are acceptable, and which are no longer desirable? Baby name trends are a perfect example of how norms change over time within different social groups. And based on new research , it's likely the structure of our social networks that determines whether new norms are spontaneously adopted. Advertisement Damon Centola, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania, recently led a research project into the circumstances that give rise to new social conventions, from popular baby names to workplace norms to common slang terms. Using a Web-based model, Penn researchers tested how large populations come to be in agreement about ideas and codes of conduct -- showing why, for instance, different regions of the country have different words for the same product (e.g. \"soda\" vs. \"pop\") and how social movements like feminism have made their way into the mainstream and become popular. \"Our study explains how certain ideas and behaviors can gain a foothold and, all of a sudden, emerge as big winners,\" Centola said in a university press release . \"It is a common misconception that this process depends upon some kind of leader, or centralized media source, to coordinate a population. We show that it can depend on nothing more than the normal interactions of people in social networks.\" Centola and his colleagues created an online game to simulate the way languages evolve in the course of human interactions. They recruited a large group of Internet users to participate, and analyzed the evolution of the participants' responses to one another as they tried to zero in on a consensus about names. Advertisement The participants were paired together for rounds of a so-called \"name game,\" in which they were shown a photograph of a face and asked to give it a name. If both players gave the same name, they won a small cash prize. If they gave different names, they lost a small amount of money and were each shown the name their partner came up with. The participants would continue this game with new partners for as many as 40 rounds, with the incentive in each round to come up with popular names. \"We wanted to study situations in which people people's primary interest is coordinating with one another, and they could invent any behavior they want -- i.e., situations in which there were an unlimited number of possibilities,\" Centola explained in an email to The Huffington Post. \"This represents the situation with most social customs, such as language, politeness, gender conventions, and even health behaviors, where people can do or say anything, but they are primarily concerned with choosing behaviors that match up with what other people are doing.\" For the second part of the experiment, the researchers tried changing the way the participants interacted with one another. Twenty-four players were assigned positions within one of three types of \"social networks\" -- but none of the players knew what their position was, or how many other people were in their network. Advertisement In the \"geographical network,\" each player repeatedly interacted with four other players in a local \"neighborhood.\" In the \"small world network,\" each player interacted with four players from across the wider network. And in the \"random mixing\" network, each player was paired with a different player at random for every new round. The researchers observed patterns of behavior within each of the networks. In the geographical and small world networks, there were several popular names, but the communities did not come to a consensus on any \"winning\" names. In the random mixing network, however, a winning name emerged after just a few rounds of playing. This suggests that large social networks with lots of interaction are most likely to come up with social norms. Though this process appeared to be spontaneous, it came about through widespread interaction . \"Consensus spontaneously emerged from nothing,\" Centola said. \"At first it was chaos, everyone was saying different things and no one could coordinate, and then all of a sudden people who had never interacted with each other were all using the same words.\" Advertisement The findings could offer insight on how social change occurs within the context of online activity, which, of course, involves increased interaction across large networks. That kind of wide-scale communication has allowed attitudes and beliefs that once might have remained marginal to instead achieve widespread exposure -- as seen in everything from the Arab Spring uprisings to the recent movement against childhood vaccinations. \"We may be able to use these studies to understand the critical density at which online social networks shift from local opinion formation, to spontaneous convergence on norms,\" Centola told HuffPost. \"The capacity of these networks to produce this kind of massive change in behavior, even though no one person or organization is advocating it, suggests that large and unexpected swings in collective attitudes and collective behaviors may become more common in the future as more and more people are connected online.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What It Was Like to Glimpse John Nash's Beautiful Mind John Nash was a legend. He simply looked at things differently. He taught me that even geniuses need other people to correct their thinking and vet their ideas. Most importantly, however, Nash taught me that anyone's mind can be beautiful if it focuses on producing beautiful ideas. By Maurice Ewing, Ph.D., Contributor Writes about the mental hangups that hamper success Writes about the mental hangups that hamper success May 25, 2015, 03:04 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Princeton University professor John Nash poses on the university's campus in Princeton, N.J. Oct. 11, 1994. Nash was named the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in economics. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) While finishing my dissertation at Princeton, I had the distinct pleasure of taking a seminar with John Nash . If you've read the book or seen the movie, A Beautiful Mind , you'll know that Nash suffered from schizophrenia and this seminar was one of his first appearances since having brought that mental ailment under control. Not knowing what to expect, most of us signed up just for the opportunity to spend time with Nash. He was a legend. Though we'd seen him as a shadowy figure that often lurked around Firestone library with a stack of paper scribblings, none of us ever spoke to him and we were curious about what a true genius might actually say. Advertisement Strangely enough, that didn't make everyone on the faculty happy. I remember one game theorist telling me that taking Nash's seminar would be a \"distinct waste of time\". That was an ironic comment since Nash essentially \"invented\" game theory -- non-cooperative game theory, in particular. Non-coop game theory is the study of how individuals or institutions might interact strategically if they don't communicate and Nash won the 1994 Nobel Prize for presenting the first, stable solution to such a situation. If you loved the films, The Usual Suspects or LA Confidential , for example, those plots demonstrated non-cooperative game theory in its great, Hollywood form. Surprisingly, however, Nash didn't speak about non-coop game theory. Instead he presented the work he'd been doing on cooperative game theory . Coop-game theory is about how groups of individuals might enforce behaviour to achieve certain outcomes. Just about every spy movie with a dastardly syndicate influencing its members involves coop theory. Advertisement Yet, what made Nash's presentation amazing was his sharp mind and wit. He simply looked at things differently. His whole approach involved painting a picture of an idea -- not simply stating a few results. Having not presented anything publicly in nearly 50 years, some complained that his work failed to connect with the recent direction of the literature and didn't seem to have a point. That seemed like dismissive jealousy to many of us, since what Nash presented was simply fresh, true and relevant to the real world. After the presentation, our group went to a small room with Nash for cookies and a discussion. Of course, while Nash wanted to talk about his results and possible extensions, we all wanted to know about his life and how he came to be \"Nash\". That made him noticeably uncomfortable, so the group of us became a bit clever and started asking Nash questions that we hoped would reveal his genius. I asked him who had influenced his choice of dissertation topic and he said, no one. Another person wondered whether Nash's work was accepted readily by people around the mathematics department at the time and Nash said, no. Finally, we hit the jackpot when I asked Nash how his model could explain the politics of the world we currently see. Advertisement All of a sudden, this 70-something year old man stood up and spoke to us with a 20-something year old's energy. He started illustrating the interesting point that powerful, cooperative relationships actually stem from the lack of power, not from the possession of it. Enforcing the rules of a coalition was really about playing on the fears and insecurities of other members. All of that made a sort of counterintuitive sense to us. It made me think, for example, about Hitler's rise to power and his ability to create alliances with the leadership of \"seemingly nice countries\". In school, we were taught that most of these countries fell under Hitler's sway for fear Nazi invasion. Nash's model, however, suggested that insecurity was what might have motivated the Axis powers. While we pondered Nash's ideas, what further amazed us was his humility and hunger for intellectual interaction, even with us lowly graduate students. He spoke to us as colleagues and invited us to validate his thinking. He also encouraged us when he believed we were on the right track, and gently corrected us when we got things wrong. Advertisement I was definitely the dumbest person in the room and felt especially fortunate to interact with him in this way. At one point, when he complimented me on something I said, I remember thinking, \"A genius has just said he likes the way I think -- I gotta' tell my boys at home about this!\" Like all good things, our time with Nash eventually came to an end. I doubt that he took much away from us, but we definitely took a great deal away from him. Nash taught me, for example, that brilliant ideas are not the exclusive domain of people with great minds; yet it's hard to imagine many people deserving the title \"great\" without brilliant ideas. Advertisement Nash taught me that we thinkers are no less artistic and creative in our ideas than the greatest of artists, unless we choose to be so. Nash taught me that even geniuses need other people to correct their thinking and vet their ideas (as he had done in interacting with Von Neumann). Most importantly, however, Nash taught me that anyone's mind can be beautiful if it focuses on producing beautiful ideas.

Russia\u2019s state-run TASS news agency said the weather station was on Troynoy Island , in the Kara Sea. Ten adult bears and some cubs are living on the island with the researchers, and one female bear has been sleeping under the building\u2019s windows. Advertisement \u201cWe have issued a recommendation for the station\u2019s personnel to use extreme caution, not to leave the station without a serious need and continue only with possible meteorological observations,\u201d Vassiliy Shevchenko, head of the Sevgidromet State Monitoring Network, told TASS. The bears have already killed one of the dogs kept at the weather station, TASS reported, and the scientists have run out of the flares they use to scare the gigantic creatures. For now, the scientists have had to give up on any projects that involve going outside. \u201c The bears live in the Arctic, you know \u2015 we can\u2019t ban them from hanging around,\u201d Shevchenko told NBC News. \u201cWorst case, the station chief has a gun.\u201d Advertisement A ship with supplies \u2015 including more flares and dogs \u2015 is on its way, but won\u2019t reach the scientists for about a month. \u201cAt the end of October, or in the beginning of November, the near-shore waters will freeze and the bears will leave the island in search for food,\u201d Shevchenko told TASS. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Moon, Venus And Comet Catalina Shine In Beautiful Space Photograph The captivating shot was taken from a farmer's field in Georgia. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Dec 14, 2015, 03:48 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT CREDIT: Greg Hogan An almost holy trinity of celestial objects came together for this spectacular space shot. Photographer Greg Hogan took the captivating snap of the moon, Venus and Comet Catalina (C/2013 US10) before dawn on Dec. 7. The image was featured as NASA's \"Astronomy Picture of the Day\" on Saturday. Advertisement Hogan told The Huffington Post he spent weeks planning how best to get the image. \" I knew all three of those objects would be very close to each other that morning in the sky on December 7th and had a gut feeling if I planned it right it and the weather was clear that it would be a great shot,\" Hogan said via email. At 4 a.m., he went to a farmer's field just a few miles from his home in Kathleen, Georgia, to set up his equipment. Using a Canon 7D camera and a 85mm prime lens set at f2.8, Hogan took several separate exposures for the moon, comet and stars before overlaying them to create the stunning picture. Advertisement The moon appears at the top of the shot, Venus in the middle, and Comet Catalina -- with light emanating from both sides -- at the bottom. \"That morning was actually an incredible morning for me, lots of bright meteors and beautiful clear skies,\" Hogan said. \"Very memorable. When I looked over the images and seen what I had captured I knew I had something very unique and special. It is a top favorite shot of mine,\" he added. Advertisement The picture was taken just as the Geminid meteor shower , which peaked Sunday night through Monday morning, was starting.
