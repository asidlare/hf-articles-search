NASA's Curiosity Rover Snaps Another Stunning 'Selfie' On Mars #humblebrag. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 30, 2016, 06:31 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT NASA's Curiosity Mars rover just loves a good selfie. The car-sized explorer took time out from its busy sand scooping and sieving schedule to snap yet another self-portrait on Mars. The spectacular image -- perhaps the ultimate humble brag -- is a composite of 57 photographs it took of itself by the Red Planet's Namib Dune on Jan. 19: NASA's Curiosity Mars rover snapped the selfie at the Namib Dune, where it was scooping samples of sand for lab analysis. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Advertisement NASA scientists used its Mars Hand Lens Imagers camera at the end of its arm to snap the shot. As the image is a composite, only part of the arm is visible. The selfie, which NASA released on Friday, is at least the third that Curiosity has beamed back to Earth since first landing on the planet on Aug. 6, 2012. In August 2015, it sent back a 92-image composite selfie after drilling a rock nicknamed \"Buckskin\" in the Marias Pass area. Advertisement Meanwhile, in June 2014, it snapped a self-portrait to celebrate being on Mars for exactly one full Martian year -- the equivalent of 687 Earth days. The Curiosity rover used electric lights at night to illuminate this postage-stamp-size view of Martian sand grains. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS The explorer's initial mission was to \" determine whether Mars once offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life .\" Advertisement For the last two months, it's investigated active sand dunes and how the wind moves on the Bagnold Dune Field lining the northwestern flank of the planet's Mount Sharp. \"The mission's examination of active sand dunes -- the first ever studied up close other than on Earth -- is providing information about active dune processes in conditions with much less atmosphere and less gravity than on Earth,\" NASA revealed in a statement. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's Why Coffee Makes You Have To Poop It hits you just a few minutes into that first cup. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 12, 2015, 11:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT We've all been there, or at least thirty percent of coffee-drinkers have: you down your morning cup of joe and are halfway out the door when your stomach grumbles..and you suddenly have to poop. What explains coffee's laxative effect? As a new video (above) from the American Chemical Society's \"Reactions\" series says, this poo-effect used to be chalked up to caffeine, which is a known laxative. But it turns out there's more to the story. Advertisement It seems that coffee causes the stomach to ramp up its production of gastric acid. This, in turn, can cause the stomach to quickly dump its contents into the intestines. Other factors may contribute as well: coffee can induce rhythmic contractions in the intestines and raise levels of the hormones cholecystokinin and gastric, which kick-start the colon. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Magical Rainbow Ring Caught On Camera From Drone Where's the pot of gold? By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Mar 11, 2016, 07:23 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING You'll be hard-pressed to find the pot of gold at the end of this rainbow. Legend has it that leprechauns stash treasure wherever the multi-colored arc touches the ground. But this rainbow doesn't actually make contact with the Earth. Instead, it forms a mesmerizing 360-degree ring that looks like it's floating inches above the land. Martin McKenna captured the spectacular sight over Cookstown in Northern Ireland on Monday with a smartphone attached to a drone. Advertisement \" It was all grey skies and pouring rain , completely miserable. (But) the clouds parted, the sun came out and this rainbow came over the trees,\" he told the Belfast Telegraph. \"As it rose higher, there was a transition from a rainbow into a complete circle,\" McKenna added. \"It's impossible to see from ground level. It was just unbelievable. I'm still buzzing from it.\" Advertisement A rainbow in its total form never truly ends. \" Our ground-based vantage prevents us from seeing the full , colorful circle of refracted light. But when you're high enough in the sky, and when the light is just right a full rainbow is a sight to behold,\" The Washington Post reports. You'd have to be in a skyscraper or plane to witness the spectacle of a 360-degree rainbow, and the sun's height rules how much of the circle is visible . But they are not actually rare. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Colin Leonhardt took this image of a 360-degree rainbow from a helicopter above Cottesloe Beach, near Perth, Australia. Colin Leonhardt (Birdseye View Photography) Advertisement NASA explained the phenomenon best when it chose Colin Leonhardt's image (above) of a 360-degree rainbow taken from a helicopter flying over Cottesloe Beach in Perth, Western Australia, as its Astronomy Picture of the Day in October 2014. \"From the ground, typically, only the top portion of a rainbow is visible because directions toward the ground have fewer raindrops. From the air, though, the entire 360 degree circle of a rainbow is more commonly visible,\" NASA wrote.

Papers From Blackbeard Wreckage Lead To 18th-Century Voyage Thriller Bits of paper recovered from wreckage off the North Carolina coast reveal heart-pounding prose. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jan 9, 2018, 09:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Famed English pirate Blackbeard and his crew of seafaring thieves apparently weren\u2019t busy pillaging all the time \u2014 sometimes they evidently kicked back to read 18th-century ocean potboilers, scientists have discovered. Archeological conservators from the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources announced last week they\u2019d recovered tiny scraps of paper from the wreckage of Blackbeard\u2019s flagship, Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge. Advertisement Scientists carefully teased apart the 300-year-old paper, found in a mass of \u201csludge\u201d in a cannon recovered from the ship, and discovered writing that led them to a popular tale of the era. Researchers told National Geographic they were able to parse certain words, including \u201cfathom,\u201d \u201csouth\u201d and \u201cHilo,\u201d which suggested a place name. By comparing the words on the recovered paper with texts that would have been available at the time Blackbeard\u2019s ship sank, researchers linked the papers to A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform\u2019d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711 , a 1712 first-edition book by Edward Cooke of the Royal Navy. A cannon from Blackbeard's ship Queen Anne's Revenge is hoisted from the sea off the North Carolina shore in 2011. Reuters Advertisement The book described Cooke\u2019s adventures on an expedition by two ships, Duke and Dutchess, which sailed from England in 1708. Such \u201cvoyage narratives\u201d were all the rage back in the 17th and 18th centuries, according to researchers. Cooke and another author, expedition leader Captain Woodes Rogers, told the story of sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been marooned for four years on an island before his rescue. Selkirk became the model for Daniel Dafoe\u2019s The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. Perhaps Blackbeard was responsible for introducing a taste for literature among his men. Blackbeard, n\u00e9 Edward Teach, was one of the most infamous pirates of the time with a reputation for violence. Advertisement He plied the waters off the West Indies and America\u2019s eastern seaboard, once blockading Charleston while looting ships. He finally released hostages he had taken in exchange for a chest of medicine. But Blackbeard may have been more genteel than his infamous tales make him seem. The Daily Mail reported in 2015 that Blackbeard was a war veteran, and a loving family man who used his fortune to help out his siblings. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NIH Retires All Its Research Chimps, Ending Controversial Program \"We have moved on from the time when research on chimpanzees was considered essential.\" By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 19, 2015, 03:44 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A retired lab chimp looks out of his group enclosure at Chimp Haven in Keithville, Louisiana, on September 30, 2014. The National Institutes of Health announced this week that its last 50 research chimps will be retired and sent to the sanctuary. Credit: Christian Science Monitor/Getty Images Two years after retiring most of its research chimpanzees, the National Institutes of Health has announced that it\u2019s closing the doors on its entire chimp research program . In an open letter released Wednesday, NIH Director Francis Collins said the agency\u2019s last 50 chimpanzees set aside for federal medical research will be retired and sent to a sanctuary. Advertisement \"It is clear that we\u2019ve reached a tipping point,\" Collins wrote. \"Effective immediately, NIH will no longer maintain a colony of 50 chimpanzees for future research .\" According to NBC News, there hasn\u2019t been a single request to use these chimps for the past two and a half years. \"We have moved on from the time when research on chimpanzees was considered essential,\" Collins said, per the news outlet. Advertisement In 2013, NIH retired about 310 chimps , saying humans' closest relatives \"deserve special respect.\" At the time, however, the agency decided to keep 50 chimps in case they were needed for medical research. \"I think this is the natural next step of what has been a very thoughtful five-year process of trying to come to terms with the benefits and risks of trying to perform research with these very special animals ,\" Collins said in a recent interview with Nature. \"We reached a point where in that five years the need for [chimp] research has essentially shrunk to zero. \" Though the NIH will no longer be using chimps for research purposes, Collins stressed that this change will not apply to other non-human primates , such as rhesus monkeys. Advertisement \"These decisions are specific to chimpanzees. Research with other non-human primates will continue to be valued, supported, and conducted by the NIH,\" he wrote in his letter. US government ends biomedical research on chimps https://t.co/e6IZFvw7sz #INFOGRAPHIC shows chimp intelligence @AFP pic.twitter.com/WMVsRgZ0tC \u2014 AFPgraphics (@AFPgraphics) November 19, 2015 Over the years, animal welfare groups have been pushing the NIH to end the chimp research program . One such group, the Humane Society of the United States, was quick to praise the agency's announcement. Advertisement \"It's rare to close out a category of animal use so emphatically. That's exactly what's happening here, and it's thrilling,\" Wayne Pacelle, the nonprofit\u2019s president and CEO, wrote in a blog post . Some animal research advocates, however, have expressed their disappointment at the news. \"Given NIH\u2019s primary mission to protect public health, it seems surprising,\" Frankie Trull, president of the D.C.-based Foundation for Biomedical Research, told Nature. Peter Walsh, a disease ecologist at the University of Cambridge, added that the NIH move \"narrows the possibilities for [chimpanzee] conservation research.\" Advertisement ASSOCIATED PRESS The NIH said that it will be sending its remaining research chimps to Chimp Haven, a 200-acre federal sanctuary in Louisiana . Since the sanctuary currently only has space for 25 more animals, however, the chimp relocations could \"take years,\" reports NBC. Advertisement The NIH has vowed to make the move as \"stress-free as possible,\" saying the chimps will be kept in their social groups as the move gets underway.

This Tooth Holds New Clues About Our Prehistoric Relatives \"Their teeth are large and quite different in that they lack features typical of present-day humans and also features typical of Neanderthals.\" By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 18, 2015, 12:51 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A fossilized molar that once belonged to a Denisova hominin, an extinct species related to us. Bence Viola/University of Toronto Thanks to a single tooth, scientists are now sinking their teeth into a human family tree mystery -- exactly who were the Denisovans? Our distant cousin the Denisovan, an extinct hominid species, came to light in 2008 when a fossilized tooth and a piece of finger bone was discovered at Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. And in 2010, another fossilized tooth was found. Advertisement Since the discoveries, the species has remained somewhat of a mystery. However, a new analysis of one of the molars, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is offering unprecedented insight into the strange species. The research shows that they may have interbred with Neanderthals, early Homo sapiens, and possibly even another group of ancient hominins that has yet to be identified. \"Together with Neanderthals, their sister group in western Asia and Europe, they are the closest relatives of all people alive today,\" Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and a co-author of the research, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"So they are one of our closest relatives, but not our ancestors.\" A side-view of the Denisovan molar. Bence Viola/University of Toronto Advertisement P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his colleagues extracted DNA from the tooth, called Denisova 8, by using a sterile dentistry drill to take out a few milligrams of material from the fossil. They then sequenced the DNA found in the molar. The researchers were surprised to discover that Denisova 8 dates back as far 110,000 years, making it much older than the other molar and finger fossils, which are about 50,000 years old. \"One of the three individuals we studied lived perhaps as much as 60,000 years earlier than the other two individuals,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo said. \"This shows that the Denisovans were present in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia over a very long time, or at least that they were there periodically, over a long time.\" Advertisement Scientists also believe that the Denisovans may have traveled further south beyond southern Siberia, and evidence of this migration is seen today as pieces of DNA identical to Denisovan DNA can be found in modern-day New Guineans, Polynesians, Australian Aborigines, and other Asian populations, \"For example in Tibet where an adaption to live at high altitudes where there is little oxygen in the air has been shown to come from Denisovans,\" P\u00e4\u00e4bo said. Researchers in the cave where the Denisovan fossils were found. Bence Viola/University of Toronto The researchers also found in the DNA analysis some clues about who the Denisovans interbred with, including a lesser known branch of the human family tree not yet identified by scientists or from fossils, Science magazine reported. Advertisement \"If you would have told me five years ago I would be talking about [a] species we don\u2019t have any fossils for , I would have thought you were crazy,\" Dr. Todd Disotell, a molecular anthropologist at New York University, who was not involved in the new research, told The New York Times. Scientists believe that Neanderthals and Denisovans diverged from modern humans on the human family tree 400,000 years ago, according to the Times, and as each species evolved there is growing evidence that they interacted. \"Denisovans were quite diverse genetically, much more so than Neanderthals,\" Dr. Bence Viola, paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the research, told HuffPost. Such diversity suggests that there must have been many Denisovans over quite a long time. Advertisement \"The world at that time must have been far more complex than previously thought ,\" Susanna Sawyer, geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and lead author of the research, told National Geographic. \"Who knows what other hominids lived and what effects they had on us?\" The cave where the fossils were found.

Zika Virus Is At Least 50 Years Old. Here's Why You're Only Hearing About It Now. An infectious disease specialist explains all you need to know. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 30, 2016, 11:46 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A health worker in Brazil tells residents to remain inside during fumigation in an attempt to eradicate mosquitos, which transmit the Zika virus. Mario Tama via Getty Images As the Zika virus spreads, so has widespread alarm and confusion. The leader of the World Health Organization said Wednesday that it is \"spreading explosively,\" estimating up to 4 million infections over the next year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that a U.S. outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus, which is spreading rapidly through mostly central and south America, is \"likely,\" but the risk for local transmission is low. In Brazil, the virus has been linked to several thousand cases of microcephaly , a rare birth defect which causes shrinkage of the skull and brain. Advertisement \"The level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty,\" WHO director-general Dr. Margaret Chan told the organization's executive board members . \"We need to get some answers quickly.\" To explain more, HuffPost Science talked to Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, whose work focuses on the causes and prevention of infectious diseases in industrialized and developing countries. Why is Zika virus spreading now, when it's been around for decades in Asia and Africa? This is not a new virus. It's been known for 25 or 30 years but has never really spread to this extent. Advertisement This virus has been documented in Africa. It was documented creating issues in Indonesia. It was one of these things were you get a couple days of fever, a little bit of a rash, maybe some joint pain and then it goes away. It was dismissed. Zika had been viewed as a minor threat until we got into the situation where there were enough new cases to recognize this microcephaly situation , which has not been recognized before. Why have we never seen cases of microcephaly before associated with the Zika virus? There were not a lot of previous cases in pregnant women occurring at the same time. If only 5 percent of those infected have children with microcephaly, it would take lots of infections to have the abnormality both detected and related to Zika. Why do we see it now? Because there are so many cases occurring in an area where people are recognizing the disease. If it's occurring in a rural area in central Africa, it may not be recognized even though it's occurring at a low level. Advertisement \u201cThe reason we have not seen this before is that there were not a lot of previous cases in pregnant women occurring at the same time.\u201d Is it common for a virus to exist in low levels for decades and then suddenly spread on a large scale? We've seen this in some other cases. It's really a question of finding a happy situation for transmission -- everything is really related to transmission and susceptibility. We'd seen Ebola outbreaks before, but never to the extent that we saw it in West Africa last year simply because it was allowed to move into urban areas. Advertisement Once a virus goes from benign to 'spreading exponentially,' what comes next? Sooner or later -- often sooner, with something that's transmitting to this extent -- you're going to hit what we call \"exhaust susceptibles.\" The virus is going to peak and then start going down. So that's when you see that there's crowding of susceptible individuals living in areas where vector control is difficult. It will almost certainly peak then. Do you think we've reached the peak point yet for the Zika virus? We'll see. There have been certain places where there have been intense transmission -- extreme levels have been seen in crowded disadvantaged areas of Brazil. But it's going to continue to be a problem in more suburban or rural areas. How do you think this outbreak will play out the U.S.? We're going to see occasional introductions into the United States. There may be localized transmissions in the Southern U.S. if there are introductions, but it's unlikely to spread beyond those areas and it probably will be fairly easy to control because we've got the infrastructure to do it. Advertisement What's the best response, on both an international and a local level? In an area where transmission is taking place, aggressive mosquito control. In areas where transmission is not taking place, delaying travel for those pregnant to known infected areas. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Richard Dawkins Accuses Ahmed Mohamed Of Committing 'Fraud' Dawkins thinks the teenager had a plan to go viral. Paul Vale \u2014 HuffPost UK Sep 20, 2015, 03:16 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT ASSOCIATED PRESS Richard Dawkins' dubious Twitter form underwent a further mutation on Sunday, with the author claiming Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Texas teenager arrested last week on suspicion of building a bomb , was guilty of \"fraud.\" The 74-year-old evolutionary biologist and noted atheist sent out a slew of tweets over the weekend chastising the ninth-grader for not even building a clock . Some observers have dissected the photo police handed out of the device Mohamed built, claiming he just shuffled around clock parts inside a pencil case. Advertisement Dawkins opened with these on Sunday morning: If this is true, what was his motive? Whether or not he wanted the police to arrest him, they shouldn\u2019t have done so https://t.co/LtOFAAmVxK \u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 . @smenor @MhaskarChief He didn't only claim to have built it. He claimed, on Youtube, that it was his INVENTION. \u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 Rebuttals followed: @RichardDawkins @smenor @MhaskarChief What has this got to do with evolutionary biology or atheism?

That's a very emotive word to apply to a young child who is enthusiastic about engineering. \u2014 Matt Bradley (@MattBluefoot) September 20, 2015 @RichardDawkins he's an enthusiastic fourteen year and you, a grown man and public figure, are trashing him on the internet for \"fraud\" \u2014 Jon (@RowettBrew) September 20, 2015 Advertisement @RichardDawkins for a famed scientist you are really fucking stupid \u2014 reptoid (@mrreptoid) September 20, 2015 @RichardDawkins remember when you were a scientist instead of a twitter crank...those were better days \u2014 Physically, I'll (@ScottyTonga) September 20, 2015 Yet Dawkins' ire remained fixed on Ahmed's claim he invented the device... and not the fact that a teenager was arrested for exploring rudimentary electronics. Advertisement If the reassembled components did something more than the original clock, that\u2019s creative. If not, it looks like hoax http://t.co/bBcaWoJpbd \u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 It's fine to disassemble & reassemble a clock. http://t.co/bBcaWoJpbd But don't claim it's your INVENTION. https://t.co/fZFF59vV0n \u2014 Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) September 20, 2015 Then a slight evolution in Dawkins' thinking: OK, fraudulent claiming of an \"invention\" is not heinous.

Astronomers Have Detected Clouds Of Water Outside Our Solar System Scientists have found a dwarf star \"dominated by water vapor and clouds, with an overall appearance that is strikingly similar to Jupiter.\" By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Jul 10, 2016, 03:42 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This artist's conception shows how WISE 0855 might appear if viewed up close in infrared light. The brown dwarf was discovered in 2014 and is 7.2 light years from Earth. Joy Pollard, Gemini Observatory/AURA Astronomers say they have detected clouds of water outside of our solar system \u2015 the first discovery of its kind. The remarkable find was located 7.2 light years from Earth on a brown dwarf \u2015 a type of low-mass star \u2015 called WISE 0855. It\u2019s described as the coldest known object outside of our solar system and \u201cstrikingly similar to Jupiter.\u201d Advertisement \u201cIts extremely low temperature makes it the first object after Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn likely to host water clouds in its visible atmosphere,\u201d researchers stated in their report that was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters back in May. A team of astronomers at The University of California at Santa Cruz led the findings. NASA\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) first detected WISE 0855 in 2014. It wasn\u2019t until recent observations over 13 nights and about 14 hours, using Hawaii\u2019s Gemini-North telescope and the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph, that researchers say they were able to get a clear enough picture of its infrared spectrum. The spectrum not only confirms, with \u201cthe best evidence,\u201d that objects that cold would have water clouds but also provides new insight into this outer star as well as into Jupiter, Andrew Skemer, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said in a press release this week . Advertisement \u201cOur spectrum shows that WISE 0855 is dominated by water vapor and clouds, with an overall appearance that is strikingly similar to Jupiter,\u201d Skemer, who co-authored the report, said. \u201cNow that we have a spectrum, we can really start thinking about what\u2019s going on in this object.\u201d The brown dwarf is similar in size and temperature to Jupiter. Because it isn't able to shine like an ordinary star it's considered a \"failed star.\" NASA In addition to abundant water vapor, Jupiter and WISE 0855 also share similar temperatures \u2014 WISE 0855 being around 250 Kelvin or -9 degrees Fahrenheit, and Jupiter at 130 Kelvin. Advertisement \u201cWISE 0855 is our first opportunity to study an extrasolar planetary-mass object that is nearly as cold as our own gas giants,\u201d Skemer said. The brown dwarf likely has a less turbulent atmosphere than Jupiter, however. That\u2019s because it does not heavily absorb the toxic gas phosphine like Jupiter does, the report explains. It\u2019s also about five times the mass of Jupiter. \u201cThe spectrum allows us to investigate dynamical and chemical properties that have long been studied in Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, but this time on an extrasolar world,\u201d Skemer noted. Advertisement The atmospheric findings appear to further blur the line between planets and brown dwarfs, which are often called \u201cfailed stars.\u201d That\u2019s because they are smaller than typical stars, though larger than planets, and therefore unable to sustain the nuclear fusion that makes regular stars shine, NASA explains on its website . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 10, 2016, 02:30 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING NASA astronaut Scott Kelly's 340 days in space were quite magnificent. He got to space walk and take some incredible out-of-this-world photos . Now that he has returned home, Kelly has been busy enjoying what many of us would find more mundane, such as eating salads and going to the dentist. Advertisement Since Kelly landed back on Earth on March 2 after nearly a year in space , he has offered an insider's look at his life on land in photos posted to Instagram . Not only are his daily activities vastly different to life on the International Space Station , but he told CBS News that he also has changed as a person. \"I think I'm a little more compassionate now,\" Kelly said. \"I think it does change you when you spend all this time removed and detached from Earth. And you follow what's going on on Earth, and mostly what the news reports is not good stuff... we should be doing better. We can do better.\" So, what has Kelly's first week back on Earth really been like? Scroll down for 10 photos that show he's pretty much just like the rest of us.

Invisibility Cloak May Be Moving Closer To Reality Scientists say they have successfully tested an ultra-thin invisibility cloak. Will Dunham Sep 20, 2015, 10:20 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT By Will Dunham WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - A cloak of invisibility may be common in science fiction but it is not so easy in the real world. New research suggests such a device may be moving closer to reality. Scientists said on Thursday they have successfully tested an ultra-thin invisibility cloak made of microscopic rectangular gold blocks that, like skin, conform to the shape of an object and can render it undetectable with visible light. Advertisement The researchers said while their experiments involved cloaking a miniscule object they believe the technology could be made to conceal larger objects, with military and other possible applications. The cloak, 80 nanometers in thickness, was wrapped around a three-dimensional object shaped with bumps and dents. The cloak's surface rerouted light waves scattered from the object to make it invisible to optical detection. It may take five to 10 years to make the technology practical to use, according to Xiang Zhang, director of the Materials Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Advertisement \"We do not see fundamental roadblocks. But much more work needs to be done,\" said Zhang, whose research was published in the journal Science. The technology involves so-called metamaterials, which possess properties not present in nature. Their surfaces bear features much smaller than the size of a wavelength of light. They redirect incoming light waves, shifting them away from the object being cloaked. The cloaking \"skin\" boasts microscopic light-scattering antennae that make light bouncing off an object look as if it were reflected by a flat mirror, rendering the object invisible. Advertisement \"The fact that we can make a curved surface appear flat also means that we can make it look like anything else. We also can make a flat surface appear curved,\" said Penn State University electrical engineering professor Xingjie Ni, the study's lead author. The researchers said they overcame two drawbacks of previous experimental microscopic cloaks that were bulkier and harder to \"scale up,\" or become usable for larger objects. Ni said the technology eventually could be used for military applications like making large objects like vehicles or aircraft or even individual soldiers \"invisible.\" Advertisement Ni also mentioned some unconventional applications. How about a cloaking mask for the face? \"All the pimples and wrinkles will no longer be visible,\" Ni said. How about fashion design? Ni suggested a cloak that \"can be made to hide one's belly.\" (Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Eric Beech) Watch the ultra-thincloak render a 3D object invisible in the video below.

Millions Of 'Shade Balls' Protect LA's Water During Drought You have to see this to believe it. By Lydia O'Connor Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 11, 2015, 10:03 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Los Angeles can't make it rain, but it can shield its precious water with \"shade balls\" -- 96 million of them to be exact. For months, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has been releasing the black plastic balls to float on the surface of the 175-acre Los Angeles Reservoir in a massive drought relief project. The final 20,000 went in on Monday, with some assistance from LA Mayor Eric Garcetti. Advertisement Credit: Gene Blevins/Zuma/Corbis By deflecting UV rays , the opaque spheres are expected to protect more than 300 million gallons of water from evaporating in Southern California's harsh sunlight every year. LADWP was the first utility company to use this technology to protect water, according to a press release from Garcetti. Advertisement \"In the midst of California's historic drought, it takes bold ingenuity to maximize my goals for water conservation,\" the mayor said. \"This effort by LADWP is emblematic of the kind of creative thinking we need to meet those challenges.\" Besides slowing evaporation, the shade balls prevent sunlight from triggering a dangerous reaction between bromite, a chemical occurring naturally in groundwater, and the chlorine used to disinfect the water. When sunlight interacts with those two chemicals, Plastic News explains, the suspected carcinogen bromate is formed. The shade balls also deter wildlife from contaminating the reservoir, shield the water from wind-blow dust and discourage algae from forming on the water's surface. Advertisement City officials hailed the shade balls as very cost-effective. They run just 36 cents a piece, The Guardian noted, and require no additional construction or maintenance -- except to be rotated occasionally. \"Shade balls are a great example of how engineering meets common sense ,\" LADWP general manager Marcie Edwards said in Garcetti's press release. \"... As we make updates, we are mindful to be wise and practical with our investments. Shade balls are an affordable and effective way to comply with regulations, and help us continue to deliver the best drinking water to our customers.\" Watching the shade balls cascade into LA's largest reservoir is also completely mesmerizing. Take a look at the photos below: Advertisement Gene Blevins/Zuma/Corbis An employee of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power opens a bag of shade balls. Gene Blevins/Zuma/Corbis LADWP employees release the shade balls. Gene Blevins/Zuma/Corbis Advertisement Gene Blevins/Zuma/Corbis Camera crews capture the Los Angeles Reservoir's new look.

After a snowpack measure in the Sierra Nevada mountains in April revealed levels at a record low 6 percent of the long-term average for that time of the year, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) announced California's first-ever statewide mandatory water cutbacks, and those remain in effect. Money could soon become available for bigger projects. Last month, California's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, introduced emergency drought legislation in Congress, aimed at supporting other water projects in their dry state and helping poor rural communities that face severe water shortages. | Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Close From Our Partner What's Hot More In Science NEWS POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE VOICES HUFFPOST PERSONAL SHOPPING NEWSLETTERS About Us Advertise Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers User Agreement Comment Policy DMCA Policy HuffPost Press Room Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy Consent Preferences Privacy Settings Part of HuffPost Science. \u00a92025 BuzzFeed, Inc.

This Tiny Robot Stingray Made From Gold And Rat Hearts Can Also Swim The latest from the cyborg department. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jul 7, 2016, 03:08 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The robotic ray. Karaghen Hudson and Michael Rosnach Scientists have unveiled a miniature robotic stingray the size of a toenail that sails smoothly through water, guided by pulses of light. The bio-inspired robot is a made of a mixture of living rat heart cells and artificial material. It is only 16 millimeters long \u2015 less than two-thirds of an inch \u2015 and weighs just 10 grams, or a third of an ounce. Advertisement Just like stingrays and their Batoid relatives, the robot moves its flat body smoothly through water by flapping its fins in a wave-like motion. The movement of the fins is controlled by light pulses delivered to the heart muscles that line the surface of the fins. The development of the robot ray is described in the journal Science on Thursday. The robotic ray and its biological counterpart, little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). Karaghen Hudson Kevin Kit Parker, an applied physicist at Harvard University who led the team of researchers, said the robot ray could interest scientists in a variety of fields \u2015 from the cardiac physiologist interested in how the muscular architecture of the heart creates its unique pumping function, to the robotics engineer looking to use cells as a living engineering material. Advertisement Parker himself specializes in developing tiny human organs that can be used to test drug safety and efficacy. But he took a detour into robotics after a visit to an aquarium with his daughter a couple of years ago. \u201cThe \u2018eureka\u2019 moment for the project came when my daughter Caroline and I were at the New England Aquarium,\u201d Parker told The Huffington Post. \u201cShe was trying to pet a stingray. She put her hand in the water and the stingray quickly moved away from her hand in a very elegant way,\u201d Parker said. He realized he could build a system with musculature similar to cell layers of the heart. \u201cIt struck me like a thunderbolt.\u201d Advertisement Parker and his colleagues created the robot ray out of a gold skeleton in the shape of a stingray, covered with a thin layer of flexible polymer. Next came the brain and muscle of the ray: an orderly lined sheath of approximately 200,000 heart muscle cells, grown from a rat embryo and put on top of the robot. Advertisement To control the cells, the team turned to optogenetics, a method often used in neuroscience studies as a way to switch neurons on and off with light. Neurons or heart muscles don\u2019t naturally respond to light. But in optogenetics, the cells are upgraded with a chunk of DNA. This special DNA codes for a protein that responds to light, rendering the cells light-sensitive. Now, with a burst of light, the modified cells contract, sending a downward wave through the fins. When the cells relax, the robot\u2019s skeleton pushes the fins back up. The result is a swimming robot ray that follows the light source. When the cells are stimulated by light, they contract and send a wave down the fins, propelling the ray forward. Sung-Jin Park Advertisement Parker notes that in this design the cells are both the sensors and actuators, which comes with benefits and disadvantages: While living muscle cells are much more energy-efficient than synthetic actuators, they are also vulnerable. And to stay alive, they need to be immersed in a warm solution with salt and sugar. \u201cCells as a building material have a vote in whether or not I am going to have a good day in the lab,\u201d Parker said. \u201cThey like to be wet, they are both robust and vulnerable, and they die.\u201d Applying a source of light to each fin allowed the researchers to stimulate the right or left fin and steer the robot in either direction. Different frequencies of light control how fast the fins, and hence the robot, move about. Advertisement Adam Summers, director of the Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics Lab at the University of Washington, called the robot \u201ca technical tour de force combining tissue engineering, robotics, organismal biology and biomechanics to yield a functional device.\u201d \u201cThat they got it to flap is wonderful. That they were able to steer it is nothing short of amazing,\u201d he said. Advertisement Parker\u2019s interest in aquatic creatures overlaps with his interest in understanding how the heart and various aspects of the anatomy help move blood in the body. And pumping and moving fluids is something marine life forms are very good at, he said. \u201cThe idea is to get a better insight into the human heart and heart disease by reverse engineering other forms of muscular pumps that we see in nature,\u201d he said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How A Firm Helps Small Communities Remove Contamination From Their Water How A Firm Helps Small Communities Remove Contamination From Water Matt Weiser \u2014 Water Deeply Jan 29, 2016, 01:23 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Berkeley-based engineering firm SimpleWater has developed a new way to remove arsenic from groundwater through the age-old rusting process. SimpleWater chief science officer Susan Amrose works in her lab. Noah Berger, UC Berkeley John Pujol and his team at SimpleWater, a Berkeley-based engineering firm, have developed a new way to put contaminated wells back into service by making friends with the age-old process of rusting metal. It could be cheaper and easier for many communities dealing with arsenic problems. The way some people look at it, California has plenty of water to survive its periodic droughts. The problem is much of that water isn\u2019t drinkable, and can\u2019t be made drinkable, because it is too contaminated. This is how John Pujol sees the situation. As CEO of SimpleWater , he has helped develop a new method to remove arsenic from groundwater. Arsenic is a naturally occurring element, but beyond a certain concentration it can cause a variety of health problems, including cancer, and can even be fatal when it arises in excessive quantities. More than 2,200 California drinking water sources are tainted by arsenic, and 600 of these exceed the state\u2019s regulatory standard for arsenic contamination. Rigid federal water quality standards exist to protect the public from arsenic in drinking water. But those standards often require communities to spend millions of dollars seeking a new water supply or paying for expensive filtration systems that often don\u2019t work well or cost too much for small water systems to afford. Pujol and his colleagues believe they have a much simpler solution using an age-old natural principle: rust. Their system, called ArsenicVolt , uses the erosive process of rusting metal to capture and extract arsenic from water. It was developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory by two of Pujol\u2019s partners. SimpleWater holds a license to market the technology. The goal is an easier and cheaper system to help small communities revive productive wells tainted by arsenic. Water Deeply recently interviewed Pujol in Albuquerque, N.M., where his company was selected to compete for $50,000 in startup funds at a Village Capital venture funding event. SimpleWater CEO John Pujol attends a venture funding competition in Nov. 2015. The company's rusting process is a cheaper and easier way to help small communities revive wells tainted by arsenic. JakMediaLLC.com Water Deeply: How serious is the arsenic problem? John Pujol: An estimated 4 million Americans are drinking water with arsenic in it. This creates a 1-in-300 chance of developing cancer. There\u2019s a lot of places in California where they cannot access their water in a drought because of a very small arsenic problem. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s no water in California. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s dirty. Advertisement Water Deeply: What\u2019s the typical solution? Pujol : You either have to drill new wells \u2013 and that\u2019s a gamble \u2013 or you treat the water you\u2019ve got, and that can get very expensive. Many treatment systems rely on filters or chemicals. These also require a staff to maintain and monitor. Water Deeply: How does your water treatment system work? Pujol : It\u2019s a process called electrochemical arsenic remediation , or ECAR. We immerse an iron plate in the water flow. Then when we electrify the iron plate with a particular current, it coaxes iron particles off the plate. These bind with the arsenic in the water and settle out, leaving the water clean. It\u2019s really painfully easy. This is an opportunity to change the way we treat water \u2013 switch it away from complexity. But scientifically, it\u2019s unknown exactly what the mechanism is. Chances are, iron is a very good coagulant, so it\u2019s good at removing any charged particles (like arsenic). Advertisement Arsenic can cause a host of health problems, including cancer, if ingested beyond a certain concentration. Ben Brown of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality filters a water sample from the Utah's San Juan River following a lead and arsenic spill nearby. Matt York/ASSOCIATED PRESS Water Deeply: Is your system in use anywhere currently? Pujol : We\u2019ve done a number of test projects. And later this year we\u2019ll launch our first significant pilot project in the town of Grimes, in Colusa County, California, which has about 500 water connections. It\u2019s a very low-income area, and they\u2019ve already tried three other solutions, all of which were either ineffective or too expensive. Water Deeply: How much will this cost, and who\u2019s paying for it? Pujol : It will cost between $300,000 and $400,000, which is more than it would cost in normal operating conditions because that includes extensive documentation and data analysis. Even so, we estimate it will be 60 percent cheaper than what they\u2019ve tried before, mostly from operational savings. They won\u2019t need to hire engineers or buy any chemicals. Advertisement Every small water system has been burned at least once after paying for a full pilot project and then finding out afterward that it\u2019s too expensive. There\u2019s a Red Sea of failed arsenic technologies. So when we show up, we have to be careful. That\u2019s why we\u2019re paying for the pilot in Grimes with help from a $100,000 grant from the EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). About 4 million Americans are drinking water with arsenic in it, Pujol said. A hydrologic technician gathers water samples from the San Juan River, Utah, following a lead and arsenic spill nearby. Matt York/ASSOCIATED PRESS Water Deeply: Doesn\u2019t the iron plate eventually erode away completely in your process? Pujol : Yes, it nearly corrodes the iron plate to extinction. And it creates a nontoxic, arsenic-laden solid waste from the eroded iron particles, which are gathered in a collection tank. But then our trucks will come pick up the old iron plate, replace it with a new one, and we\u2019ll haul away the waste material. The water agency doesn\u2019t have to manage this. Advertisement Water Deeply: What other projects are you working on? Pujol : We\u2019re working on a subscription-based water filtration solution for homeowners that we call DropDrop. It\u2019s a small filter that screws onto your kitchen faucet. It\u2019s a coconut-fiber cartridge that filters out lead, chlorine, arsenic and pharmaceuticals. Our goal, ultimately, is to shift water treatment away from the current model of a centralized water treatment facility. This is proving inadequate to treat the water problems we have in America today. No longer will municipalities have to solve water-quality problems on a regional basis. They can solve it at the tap. Water Deeply: How much will this cost? Pujol : We\u2019re estimating it will cost the homeowner $7 per month. The problem with current faucet filters is that the replacement filters have to be purchased at a store, and you have to find a store that sells the right one. Also, many of these are clunky objects that get in the way of washing dishes, or they\u2019re installed under the sink where they are easily neglected. Often, the homeowner forgets to change the filter for months and months, which renders the filter useless. Or they can\u2019t find a replacement. Advertisement With our solution, for a subscription fee of just $7 per month, the homeowner gets a new filter in their mailbox every month, which serves as a reminder and an incentive to change out the old one. And it\u2019s easy: You just unscrew the end of your faucet just like you\u2019re installing a faucet aerator. Then you pop out the old filter, drop in the new one, and screw it back together.

You Might Be Able To Outrun A Supervolcano All those years playing \"the floor is lava\" could finally pay off. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 8, 2016, 07:14 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT You probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about the \" supervolcano \" lurking beneath Yellowstone National Park , but should that behemoth decide to erupt, it would be nothing short of catastrophic. By some estimates, 87,000 people would die almost immediately , and two-thirds of the United States would be left uninhabitable. A new study , however, suggests we humans might have a fighting chance after all -- if, that is, we're in good running shape. Advertisement Researchers looked at the pyroclastic flows -- a fast-moving mix of lava, ash and volcanic gas -- following a super-eruption in Arizona 18.8 million years ago, and discovered that they moved much slower than many experts previously thought. The recent findings have sparked a debate within the scientific community, raising questions about whether people in the immediate area of such a cataclysmic event would stand any chance of escape. \" I wouldn't recommend anyone try to outrun a volcano ,\" study co-author Greg Valentine, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo in New York, told Live Science. \"But there's a few of us that could.\" Advertisement Grand Prismatic Spring, among the largest hot springs in the world, is a main attraction at Yellowstone National Park. Philippe Bourseiller via Getty Images For their study , published Monday in the journal Nature Communications , Valentine and his team focused on an ancient eruption at Silver Creek caldera , in western Arizona. According to the UB Reporter at the University of Buffalo, when this supervolcano blew its top 18.8 million years ago, it flooded parts of California, Nevada and Arizona with pyroclastic flows . Some flows traveled more than 100 miles from their source, according to the study. By looking at rocks in the ancient volcanic deposit, the researchers determined that the flows from the Silver Creek eruption reached \" modest and uniform \" speeds of around 10 to 45 mph. In comparison, flows during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, which killed 57 people, were clocked at around 380 mph, according to the study. Advertisement Valentine told the UB Reporter that understanding the behavior of ancient flows could help experts do a better job of forecasting and preparing for future volcanic disasters. \u201cThe character and speed of the flows will affect how much time you might have to get out of the way, although the only truly safe thing to do is to evacuate before a flow starts,\" he said. But some are skeptical of the recent findings. Charles Ferguson, an expert on the ancient Arizona flow and a research geologist with the Arizona Geological Survey, told Live Science that there are outcrops that suggest the ash moved quickly and energetically . \"I think their hypothesis is more problematic than explanatory,\" Ferguson said of Valentine and his team. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Watch These Timid Chimps Look Both Ways Before Crossing The Road WATCH: Cautious Chimps Look Both Ways Before Crossing By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 18, 2015, 11:49 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Look both ways before you cross the street! That life-saving precaution was drilled into us as children -- and apparently chimpanzees have picked it up too . The video above shows four chimps navigating a highway in Uganda. Watch as a timid youngster swivels his head from left to right and then left again, all while the group's alpha male waits patiently for him to catch up. Advertisement The first-of-its-kind video was made as part of a survey conducted between 2012 and 2014 in the Sebitoli area of Uganda's Kibale National Park. To assess how chimps adapt to new roads, researchers observed 122 chimps cross the highway, where cars routinely pass at speeds of up to 60 mph. The researchers noticed that the animals looked left and right 90 percent of the time while making their way. \"We've described chimpanzee behavior facing a dangerous situation never described before,\" Marie Cibot, a doctoral student in primatology at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the study's lead researcher, told New Scientist. Advertisement The new study adds to a growing body of research that shows our closest living relatives aren't nearly as different from us as we once imagined. Studies have shown that chimps throw temper tantrums , have distinct cultures , and even do puzzles for fun. And their short-term memory may be even better than ours. The study was published online April 10 in the American Journal of Primatology.

NASA\u2019s Juno Spacecraft Sent Back Some Spectacular Shots Of Jupiter \u201cWe are rewriting our ideas of how giant planets work.\" By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 8, 2018, 02:22 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT After orbiting Jupiter for a little more than a year and a half, NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft recently finished its 10th trip around the massive planet. Now the space agency is sharing some of the photos Juno snapped that were edited by citizen scientists , including this close-up shot of Jupiter\u2019s surface: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/Gerald Eichstadt/Sean Doran Advertisement The image was taken on Dec. 16, 2017 from nearly 8,300 miles above Jupiter\u2019s clouds, and processed, or edited, by Gerald Eichst\u00e4dt and Se\u00e1n Doran. NASA routinely releases batches of photos taken by the Juno probe for the public to process and even asks for input about what the spacecraft should next capture . \u201cJupiter completely fills the image, with only a hint of the terminator (where daylight fades to night) in the upper right corner, and no visible limb (the curved edge of the planet),\u201d NASA wrote about the above shot. Eichst\u00e4dt and Doran released several other Juno probe images that they edited last month: NASA / SwRI / MSSS / Gerald Eichstadt / Sean Doran Advertisement NASA / SwRI / MSSS / Gerald Eichstadt / Sean Doran NASA / SwRI / MSSS / Gerald Eichstadt / Sean Doran According to NASA, the Juno program is a $1.1 billion endeavor to \u201cunderstand the origin and evolution of Jupiter.\u201d The probe has instruments on board that allow it to map Jupiter\u2019s gravity fields, investigate the composition of its atmosphere and monitor the planet\u2019s auroras, among other tasks. Advertisement The probe fully orbits Jupiter once every 53 days and ventures as close as 2,600 miles to the planet\u2019s surface. Its current mission is slated to continue through July, but scientists may propose to extend it at that time. \u201cJuno is providing spectacular results, and we are rewriting our ideas of how giant planets work,\u201d Scott Bolton, a principal investigator on the Juno program, said in a statement last February. | Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement Close From Our Partner What's Hot More In Science NEWS POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE VOICES HUFFPOST PERSONAL SHOPPING NEWSLETTERS About Us Advertise Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers User Agreement Comment Policy DMCA Policy HuffPost Press Room Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy Consent Preferences Privacy Settings Part of HuffPost Science. \u00a92025 BuzzFeed, Inc.

NASA's MESSENGER Spacecraft Is About To Crash Into Mercury NASA Spacecraft Is About To Crash Into Mercury By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 17, 2015, 04:35 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Mercury is about to get a visitor . The NASA MESSENGER spacecraft that's been orbiting Mercury and collecting data for four years is about to run out of fuel. And when it does, it's going to hit the tiny planet's surface at about 8,750 miles per hour. Mission operators in mission control at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have been carrying out a series of orbit corrections that will delay the spacecraft's inevitable crash. Advertisement The final maneuver will take place next Friday, April 24. \"Following this last maneuver, we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant, as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas ,\u201d Daniel O\u2019Shaughnessy, mission systems engineer at APL, said in a news release. \u201cAt that point, the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun's gravity.\u201d The impact is expected to take place out of view on April 30. However, scientists are hoping the fresh impact crater will give them new insight into the planet. \" Having an impact crater, even a small one, whose origin date is precisely known, will be an important benchmark ,\" Sean Solomon, the mission\u2019s principal investigator and director of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York, told Space.com. Advertisement The MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging) spacecraft was launched in 2004 and entered the planet's orbit on March 18, 2011. While the spacecraft's mission may be ending, scientists are celebrating all they've learned about Mercury over the past four years. \u201cFor the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\u201d John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA said in a news release. \u201cWhile spacecraft operations will end, we are celebrating MESSENGER as more than a successful mission. It\u2019s the beginning of a longer journey to analyze the data that reveals all the scientific mysteries of Mercury.\u201d Advertisement Those mysteries may even hold a clue to the formation of life on Earth. As Mercury is the planet closest to the sun, temperatures can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit. However, craters at the poles are permanently in shadow -- and in 2012, MESSENGER discovered evidence of water ice deposits and other volatile material locked in those polar regions. It also found a dark layer covering the ice, believed to be organic compounds.

Here's Why Getting More Sleep Helps You Appear More Intelligent To Others It also helps you to appear more attractive, scientists say. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 9, 2016, 10:05 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A new study suggests that getting more sleep may help us appear more intelligent by influencing the neutral expressions that our \"resting\" faces have. Tara Moore via Getty Images Scientists have long known that slumber helps make your memory sharper , can improve focus and relieve stress -- but that's not all. A new study suggests that it can also help you to appear more intelligent to others. The way our faces look when we're tired can influence how people perceive us, and not necessarily in a good way, Sean Talamas, lead author of the study and a post-doc researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, told The Huffington Post. Advertisement \"People over-generalize in judging those with droopy eyelids and a frown as being tired and having a low mood, both of which have a well-documented detrimental effect on cognitive performance,\" he said. \"Therefore it should be no surprise that many of us find people who look less alert and who have a lower mood as less intelligent looking.\" The study, which was published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General on Feb. 25, involved 200 participants who rated how intelligent and attractive 190 different faces, with neutral expressions, appeared in photos. The researchers measured the degree of eyelid openness and mouth curvature seen in each photographed face, and then analyzed how the participants rated each image. They found that having more \"awake\" and open eyes and a slightly curved mouth related positively to intelligence ratings. Advertisement \"When looking at composites of all the faces that were rated as most intelligent versus those that were less intelligent looking, subtle differences in eyelid-openness and mouth curvature continued to be prevalent in the high-intelligent looking composite images,\" Talamas said. \"Measuring the subtlety of these differences objectively was difficult, but finding that it was related to perceived intelligence wasn't surprising.\" However, the extent to which these subtle facial cues influenced perceived intelligence was astonishing, Dr. David Perrett, psychology professor at the University of St. Andrews and a co-author of the study, told HuffPost. \"We were very surprised by the size of the effects, very subtle changes in the mouth and eyes has a profound impact on impressions of ability,\" he said. Advertisement Perrett and Talamas agreed that the new research helps us better understand how and why we might make certain judgements of others -- especially judgments that are often stereotyped and unfounded. \"It's important to understand how we perceive others and how we are perceived, as studies show time and time again that, although frequently cautioned against it, we often judge a book by it's cover,\" Talamas said. This can be particularly important in a classroom setting or job interview in which perceptions of intelligence can have a real impact,\" he added. \"Being aware of how we can change our perceived intelligence with more sleep can hopefully encourage better sleep habits.\" Advertisement Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Why Eating Slowly Really Does Make Food Taste Better It has to do with how you breathe during meals, a new study shows. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Nov 18, 2015, 11:47 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Image Source via Getty Images It turns out that taking our time to enjoy a meal actually does make it taste better, and a new study reveals how. A team of researchers has found that the way the back of our mouths are structured allows us to get a strong whiff of our food's aroma, which enhances how we perceive its flavor -- but only if we breathe slowly and quietly. Advertisement We may miss out on this enhanced experience if we scarf down our meals. \"It confirms that there is a pathway for volatiles from the mouth to the nasal cavity for stimulating smell while there is food and drink in our mouths, of which we are totally unconscious (we erroneously think it is due to taste in the mouth),\" Dr. Gordon Shepherd, professor of neuroscience at Yale University and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"It provides new evidence to help us understand what happens when we eat and drink.\" The researchers built models of a human throat, mouth and nasal cavities using a 3D printer. Then they used these models to analyze how air flows through a person's mouth while eating. The researchers found that molecules from food, called volatiles, collect at the back of the mouth, where they are carried by exhaled air to the nasal cavity. From there, olfactory receptor neurons in the nose can pick up the scent of the food. When flavors are perceived in this complex way, it's called retronasal smell . Advertisement \"This mechanism is the strongest if we eat slowly and breathe smoothly,\" Dr. Rui Ni, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Penn State University and lead author of the study, told HuffPost. \"In contrast, if we eat fast and breathe heavily when we are in a rush, we cannot taste much of the food because we are wasting a lot of food volatiles by inhaling them into the lung.\" Slowly breathing in through the nose, however, allows air to whip down the nasal cavity and into the lungs, creating a sort of air barrier that separates the throat and the mouth and keeps volatiles out of the lungs, NPR reported. On the exhale, air sweeps into the back of the mouth to carry the volatiles into the nose. The researchers concluded that the air flow effectively controls the direction and movement of the volatiles. Advertisement Or in other words, \" food smells and tastes better if you take your time ,\" Ni said in a statement. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science on Nov. 9.

Shielding Students From Stereotypes Helps Way More Than We Thought Focusing on just a few can impact an entire classroom, a new study shows. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 28, 2016, 01:29 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Helping just a few students combat \"stereotype threat\" benefits everyone's academic performance in a classroom, new research shows. Hero Images via Getty Images We all know that negative stereotypes exist and that as a result, people may be discriminated against or denied access to resources without justification. But there's another disturbing effect that often goes unnoticed. It turns out that \" stereotype threat ,\" or simply knowing that others view you as a negative stereotype, may impair your academic performance . Advertisement Scientists have long known about psychological exercises that can reduce the effects of \"stereotype threat,\" but now it seems that such exercises not only benefit those experiencing this, but also the people around them. New research suggests that when students who are vulnerable to being stereotyped complete exercises that cause them to reflect on their own personal values, they perform better in class -- and so do other students around them , even if those other students don't complete the self-reflection tasks themselves. It's unclear how an entire classroom can benefit from just a few students taking moments to self-reflect, but the researchers are excited to further study this question, Joseph Powers, a psychological scientist at Stanford University and lead author of the research, told The Huffington Post. Advertisement He said it's possible that the other students in the classroom felt motivated to perform better when they saw that their classmates' grades improved. Or perhaps the improvement in grades of some students allowed teachers to focus more time on other students who needed more attention to learn. \"This research suggests that psychological processes go beyond the individual,\" Powers said. \"Protecting people from negative stereotype threats benefits them, and these less threatened people benefit their entire group. As a field concerned with social change we could gain a lot by considering these collective effects when we measure the impact of experiments and social programs.\" The researchers analyzed data from two previous studies conducted on 550 seventh-graders, in which the students were asked to complete a 15-minute writing assignment about their personal values -- unaware that this was part of a study, Powers said. Meanwhile, a control group of students wrote about neutral topics. Advertisement About 40 percent of the students were black, 40 percent white and 20 percent of other ethnicities. \"This kind of personal reflection can broaden and protect a person's identity during difficult transitions, such as the start of seventh grade,\" Powers said. \"Affirming core values has been shown to protect students from some of the negative effects of stereotype threat and improve students' sense of social belonging and academic performance.\" The researchers found that individual student grades improved just from being in a class with a greater proportion of African-American students who completed the self-reflection task. This improvement appeared to be especially strong for low-performing students of all ethnicities. \u201cWe changed a few students and the students triggered a collective change in their environment that benefited everyone...\"\u201d - Joseph Powers, lead author of the new research Advertisement The researchers' analysis showed that adding just two or more black students who completed the self-reflection task to a classroom resulted in low-performing students' grades to increase on average by a third of a letter grade, so from a C to a C+. \"We were surprised that the effect of sharing a classroom with more affirmed students was almost as large as the effect of receiving a values affirmation,\" Powers said. \"Who would have thought that the indirect benefits of an intervention could be almost as large than the direct benefits?\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Oceanographers from U.S. and German GEOTRACES Meet in the High Arctic Ninety five percent of Earth's water lies in the ocean, and on a planet dominated by saltwater, mapping the chemistry of the global ocean requires a global effort.

Members of the U.S. science party walk across the ice and back to the Healy after a visit to the German icebreaker Polarstern. Ninety five percent of Earth's water lies in the ocean, and on a planet dominated by saltwater, mapping the chemistry of the global ocean requires a global effort. The GEOTRACES program was established in 2006 to organize this effort, drawing support and participation from 30 different nations. This summer research teams from the United States, Canada, and Germany are working together to survey the chemistry of the Arctic Ocean. Planning for the Arctic began five years ago and each nation's cruise transect was designed to maximize spatial coverage of the basin while occupying international cross-over stations to assess the accuracy of our measurements. On September 7, 2015 the USCGC Healy and German R/V Polarstern crossed paths near the North Pole, an unexpected intersection in the high Arctic. On an icebreaker it is difficult to estimate the arrival time of our planned stations (speed is dictated by ice thickness), so it was by chance that the two ships arrived near 90 \u00b0N in sync. Advertisement The afternoon was spent welcoming the German science party onto the Healy, giving tours of living quarters and lab spaces. A short walk across the ice brought us to the R/V Polarstern where we were greeted with smiles and warm cider, interacting with a new set of humans for the first time in 30 days. The Polarstern has a wooden deck, a bar with a shiny disco ball suspended from the ceiling, and a swimming pool and sauna - all stark contrasts to the metal clad military vessel the U.S. science party has grown accustomed to. I had the opportunity to visit and share data with Lars-Eric Heimburger from Bremen University, a colleague who is measuring mercury onboard the Polarstern. The encounter was a morale booster for science and crew members from both ships - what better place for an international meet-up than the North Pole?

In Case You'd Forgotten, Chameleons Are Amazing Scientists keep making incredible discoveries about the colorful creatures. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 11, 2015, 06:54 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Here are a few cool facts about chameleons: They can move their eyes independently, change color at will and shoot out their tongues to twice the length of their bodies to capture prey. A stunning new National Geographic clip highlights these and other unique attributes and describes the incredible variety within the chameleon family -- there are 202 different species ranging in color and size. Advertisement Scientists have made some striking discoveries about chameleons in recent years, most notably about the way they change color. Their technicolor skin isn't primarily used to blend in, as scientists used to believe. It's actually \" mostly for communication ,\" National Geographic's Patricia Edmonds notes. \" It\u2019s the lizard using colorful language, expressing itself about things that affect it: courtship, competition, environmental stress.\" As for their tongues? Scientists used to think chameleons shot them out by filling them with blood or inflating them with air. But they now know that the lizards' tongues actually function like a bow, using a spring-loaded system of bone, elastic tissue and muscle to snatch prey at 13 miles per hour. Credit: National Geographic/YouTube Advertisement The wildlife publication will feature the animals in its upcoming September issue . Nearly 40 percent of all chameleon species were classified as endangered or critically endangered in the most recent Red List assessment , released by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Many of the creatures are struggling to stay alive as habitat alteration and deforestation threaten to wipe them out. Some chameleons are highly specialized, and can only be found in specific habitats. Forty-two percent of them live on the island of Madagascar, off Africa's east coast. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Discover Bizarre World With Three Suns, 300-Year Seasons Eat your heart out, Tatooine! By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jul 7, 2016, 02:01 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans love Tatooine and its twin suns, but astronomers working with one of the world\u2019s biggest telescopes have done Luke Skywalker\u2019s home planet one better. They\u2019ve discovered a bizarre world with not two but three suns \u2015 and seasons that last longer than a human lifetime. Advertisement Known as HD 131399Ab, the unusual exoplanet is located 320 light-years from Earth in the large southern constellation Centaurus . It\u2019s a gas giant like Jupiter but about four times as massive. And while it\u2019s one of the coldest exoplanets ever to be directly imaged by a telescope (rather than detected as a result of the dimming of starlight as it passes in front of its host star), HD 131399Ab is very hot by human standards. The average temperature exceeds 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. In short, HD 131399Ab isn\u2019t the kind of place you\u2019d like to call home. (And there\u2019s no hint that it harbors alien life.) But if you could live there, you\u2019d find its sky a most peculiar place: You\u2019d see either constant daylight or triple sunsets, depending on the season. Advertisement And each season on HD 131399Ab lasts about 300 years. Chart showing location of the triple star HD 131399 in the constellation Centaurus (The Centaur). This triple star, whose brightest component is orbited by planet HD 131399Ab, is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye, but can be seen using binoculars. ESO/IAU and Sky HD 131399Ab orbits the system\u2019s brightest star, HD 131399A, at a distance of about 7.6 billion miles. That\u2019s roughly 82 times the average distance from the Earth to the sun \u2015 and, according to the astronomers behind the discovery, the widest orbit ever seen for a planet in a triple-star system. The other two stars in the system, HD 131399B and HD 131399C, twirl around each other as they orbit HD 131399A at a distance that\u2019s 300 to 400 times greater than the distance from the Earth to the sun. Advertisement (If you\u2019re having trouble imagining what all this looks like, the images below should help.) This graphic shows the orbit of the planet in the HD 131399 system (red line) and the orbits of the stars (blue lines). The planet orbits the brightest star in the system, HD 131399A. ESO This annotated composite image shows exoplanet HD 131399Ab in the triple-star system HD 131399. The image of the planet was obtained with the Very Large Telescope in Chile. ESO/K. Wagner et. al. The newfound planet was discovered using the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope in northern Chile. The ESO is supported by Austria, Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland Chile and the United Kingdom. Researchers published a paper on their findings Thursday in the journal Science. Advertisement Kevin Wagner, a University of Arizona Ph.D. student and the paper\u2019s lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email that the system\u2019s configuration is \u201csurprising and extreme.\u201d It\u2019s also a bit precarious. \u201cIf the planet was further away from the most massive star in the system, it would be kicked out of the system,\u201d Dr. Daniel Apai, assistant professor of astronomy and planetary sciences at the university and co-author of the paper, said in a news release. \u201cOur computer simulations have shown that this type of orbit can be stable, but if you change things around just a little bit, it can become unstable very quickly.\u201d Stable or not, HD 131399A is fascinating to astronomers in part because it helps fill in gaps in our knowledge of how planets form and change orbit. Advertisement \u201cThis new report gives us a weird dynamical system to study, pushing our models of planet formation to new limits,\u201d Dr. Jay Pasachoff, professor of astronomy at Williams College, told The Huffington Post in an email. The discovery also \u201callows us to study a planet that is close to what Jupiter would have looked like when it was very young,\u201d Apai said in the email. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Google Glass Could Save Lives In The Hospital ER A new study highlights a surprising application for the troubled product. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 10, 2015, 08:01 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Doctor Huang Yunchao wears Google Glass while performing a live surgery to remove a tumor at The Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, also known as the Tumor Hospital of Yunnan Province, on November 27, 2014 in Kunming, China. ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images Google suspended commercial production of Google Glass in January, despite copious media attention, largely because few normal consumers saw a compelling reason to buy the $1,500 computerized eyewear . But not everyone thinks Google Glass is useless. Major hospitals have been experimenting with the use of Google Glass since the first prototype was released in 2013. Advertisement The latest evidence for Glass's utility in the medical field is a study by a team at the UM ass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester , which has used Google Glass to help diagnose and treat patients arriving at the hospital ER with symptoms of poisoning. For the study, emergency room residents confronting a case of suspected poisoning would first call a toxicology expert on the telephone, as usual, to reach a preliminary diagnosis. But they would then don a specially programmed Google Glass and go to the patient's bedside to stream video, audio and photos of the patient to the expert in real time. The study's authors reported on the results of 18 such consultations. The information from Glass led the remote experts to change their diagnosis in four of these cases, and to change their therapeutic recommendation in 10 of the cases, or 56 percent. Advertisement Dr. Edward Boyer, one of the authors, told The Huffington Post in an email that Glass is particularly well-suited to toxicology because diagnosing the cause of a poisonings is largely done using visual cues, in contrast to other specialties that rely more on diagnostic testing. \"Glass allows a detailed image of the clinical findings of the physical examination to be transmitted to an expert,\" Boyer explained. \"Instead of hearing a doctor say, 'I don't know what he's got, but he looks weird,' I can now see specific traits in a patient with red, dry skin [and] large pupils [who] is feebly picking at things and has mumbling speech. That lets me diagnose a specific toxic condition and determine therapy.\" Dr. Peter Chai, another author, added that telemedicine in general is a crucial part of toxicology because few hospitals -- especially small ones in rural areas -- have expert toxicologists on staff. Chai added that Google Glass is far better suited to the physical environment of hospital clinics than most competing technologies. Advertisement \"With a wearable device like Glass, the physician is able to turn any part of any ER into an advanced telemedicine suite without investment in bulky hardware by just walking into the room,\" Chai said. Boyer said that he believes the main barrier to hospitals' use of Google Glass for toxicology is the cost of the device -- especially given that poison control centers offer doctors diagnostic help over the phone for free. Others have said that products such as Glass raise concerns about patient privacy , though several companies have developed software that allows Glass to comply with federal patient privacy laws. Another obstacle is, of course, the waning of Google's support for Glass. The company is still actively pursuing business applications for the product -- including medicine. And toxicology is just one area of interest for doctors; some have also used Google Glass to assist with dermatology, neurology and even surgery. Advertisement If these other areas prove as promising as toxicology, hospitals could end up being a crucial market for Google. In other words, the key to saving Google Glass may be saving lives.

By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 30, 2022, 03:40 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING NASA rescheduled the launch of its Artemis I mission around the moon to Saturday after the space agency was forced to scrub the first attempt due to an issue with one of the spacecraft\u2019s engines. The main problem Monday came after engineers couldn\u2019t get one of the rocket\u2019s four engines to the proper temperature needed to start them at liftoff. NASA said the Artemis team tried to quickly fix the issue before the scheduled departure time, but weren\u2019t able to do so before a two-hour launch window closed. Advertisement Mike Sarafin, the Artemis mission manager, said the team had found a path forward, including changing the engines\u2019 loading procedure and starting the engine chill down earlier. The mission is the first in a series of launches that could ultimately see astronauts headed toward the moon for the first time in half a century and a major revitalization of NASA\u2019s space exploration efforts. The next launch window opens at 2:17 p.m. ET Saturday for two hours, weather permitting. An additional window would open on Monday, NASA said. Advertisement If the mission isn\u2019t able to launch, it could potentially be pushed back by more than a month. Teams have reviewed the data from Monday's launch attempt of the #Artemis I mission and are moving forward with a second launch attempt on Sat., Sept. 3, with a two-hour launch window starting at 2:17 p.m. EDT (18:17 UTC). pic.twitter.com/oDr5plGhqS \u2014 NASA Artemis (@NASAArtemis) August 30, 2022 The decision Monday was a disappointment for thousands of rocket-watchers who drove to Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, including Vice President Kamala Harris . But NASA said it wouldn\u2019t fire up the rocket until doing so was safe, despite years of delays that have beleaguered the $40 billion project. While we hoped to see the launch of Artemis I today, the attempt provided valuable data as we test the most powerful rocket in history. Our commitment to the Artemis Program remains firm, and we will return to the moon. \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) August 29, 2022 Advertisement #Artemis1 was delayed due to an engine bleed issue, but testing is part of the process. #Artemis2 will carry @NASA_Astronauts , so we need to ensure we get it right.

Steve Nesius via Reuters \u201cWe are going to give the team time to rest, first of all, and then come back fresh tomorrow and reassess what we learned today and then develop a series of options,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say what the options are.\u201d Advertisement Bill Nelson, NASA\u2019s administrator, said the rocket was \u201cbrand new,\u201d adding it wouldn\u2019t \u201cfly until it\u2019s ready.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s just illustrative that this is a very complicated machine, a very complicated system, and all those things have to work,\u201d Nelson said during the press conference Monday. The Artemis mission will test NASA\u2019s Space Launch System, a powerful rocket, that will propel the Orion spacecraft beyond the moon. The mission will be unmanned (holding three humanoid dummies), but the Orion craft will eventually be able to hold astronauts and begin a new era of space exploration. Humans haven\u2019t stepped foot on the moon since the last Apollo mission in 1972, and NASA has pledged future efforts would see the first woman and the first person of color step foot on the lunar surface. Advertisement When it does eventually leave, Artemis I will orbit the Earth before being propelled towards the moon. The spacecraft will fly within 60 miles of the moon\u2019s surface as NASA monitors its systems, then go on into deep retrograde orbit for just under a week. The full mission will last four to six weeks before the Orion spacecraft reenters the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, traveling some 25,000 mph and producing temperatures approaching 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Creative thinking is a stable, defining characteristic in some personalities, but it may also change based on situation and context . Inspiration and ideas often arise seemingly out of nowhere and then fail to show up when we most need them, and creative thinking requires complex cognition yet is completely distinct from the thinking process. Neuroscience paints a complicated picture of creativity . As scientists now understand it, creativity is far more complex than the right-left brain distinction would have us think (the theory being that left brain = rational and analytical, right brain = creative and emotional). In fact, creativity is thought to involve a number of cognitive processes, neural pathways and emotions, and we still don't have the full picture of how the imaginative mind works. Advertisement And psychologically speaking, creative personality types are difficult to pin down, largely because they're complex, paradoxical and tend to avoid habit or routine. And it's not just a stereotype of the \"tortured artist\" -- artists really may be more complicated people. Research has suggested that creativity involves the coming together of a multitude of traits, behaviors and social influences in a single person. \"It's actually hard for creative people to know themselves because the creative self is more complex than the non-creative self,\" Scott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D., Scientific Director of the Imagination Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Huffington Post. \"The things that stand out the most are the paradoxes of the creative self ... Imaginative people have messier minds.\" While there's no \"typical\" creative type, there are some tell-tale characteristics and behaviors of highly creative people. Here are 18 things they do differently. Advertisement They daydream. Colin Anderson via Getty Images Creative types know, despite what their third-grade teachers may have said, that daydreaming is anything but a waste of time. According to Kaufman and psychologist Rebecca L. McMillan , who co-authored a paper titled \"Ode To Positive Constructive Daydreaming,\" mind-wandering can aid in the process of \"creative incubation.\" And of course, many of us know from experience that our best ideas come seemingly out of the blue when our minds are elsewhere. Advertisement Although daydreaming may seem mind less , a 2012 study suggested it could actually involve a highly engaged brain state -- daydreaming can lead to sudden connections and insights because it's related to our ability to recall information in the face of distractions. Neuroscientists have also found that daydreaming involves the same brain processes associated with imagination and creativity. They observe everything. The world is a creative person's oyster -- they see possibilities everywhere and are constantly taking in information that becomes fodder for creative expression. As Henry James is widely quoted , a writer is someone on whom \"nothing is lost.\" The writer Joan Didion kept a notebook with her at all times, and said that she wrote down observations about people and events as, ultimately, a way to better understand the complexities and contradictions of her own mind: Advertisement \"However dutifully we record what we see around us, the common denominator of all we see is always, transparently, shamelessly, the implacable 'I,'\" Didion wrote in her essay On Keeping A Notebook . \"We are talking about something private, about bits of the mind\u2019s string too short to use, an indiscriminate and erratic assemblage with meaning only for its marker.\" They work the hours that work for them. Ossi Lehtonen via Getty Images Many great artists have said that they do their best work either very early in the morning or late at night. Vladimir Nabokov started writing immediately after he woke up at 6 or 7 a.m., and Frank Lloyd Wright made a practice of waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. and working for several hours before heading back to bed. No matter when it is, individuals with high creative output will often figure out what time it is that their minds start firing up, and structure their days accordingly. Advertisement They take time for solitude. \"In order to be open to creativity, one must have the capacity for constructive use of solitude. One must overcome the fear of being alone,\" wrote the American existential psychologist Rollo May . Artists and creatives are often stereotyped as being loners, and while this may not actually be the case, solitude can be the key to producing their best work. For Kaufman, this links back to daydreaming -- we need to give ourselves the time alone to simply allow our minds to wander. \"You need to get in touch with that inner monologue to be able to express it,\" he says. \"It's hard to find that inner creative voice if you're ... not getting in touch with yourself and reflecting on yourself.\" Advertisement They turn life's obstacles around. Many of the most iconic stories and songs of all time have been inspired by gut-wrenching pain and heartbreak -- and the silver lining of these challenges is that they may have been the catalyst to create great art. An emerging field of psychology called post-traumatic growth is suggesting that many people are able to use their hardships and early-life trauma for substantial creative growth. Specifically, researchers have found that trauma can help people to grow in the areas of interpersonal relationships, spirituality, appreciation of life, personal strength, and -- most importantly for creativity -- seeing new possibilities in life. \"A lot of people are able to use that as the fuel they need to come up with a different perspective on reality,\" says Kaufman. \"What's happened is that their view of the world as a safe place, or as a certain type of place, has been shattered at some point in their life, causing them to go on the periphery and see things in a new, fresh light, and that's very conducive to creativity.\" They seek out new experiences. Dixmen via Getty Images Advertisement Creative people love to expose themselves to new experiences, sensations and states of mind -- and this openness is a significant predictor of creative output. \"Openness to experience is consistently the strongest predictor of creative achievement,\" says Kaufman. \"This consists of lots of different facets, but they're all related to each other: Intellectual curiosity, thrill seeking, openness to your emotions, openness to fantasy. The thing that brings them all together is a drive for cognitive and behavioral exploration of the world, your inner world and your outer world.\" They \"fail up.\" Resilience is practically a prerequisite for creative success, says Kaufman. Doing creative work is often described as a process of failing repeatedly until you find something that sticks, and creatives -- at least the successful ones -- learn not to take failure so personally. Advertisement \"Creatives fail and the really good ones fail often,\" Forbes contributor Steven Kotler wrote in a piece on Einstein's creative genius. They ask the big questions. Creative people are insatiably curious -- they generally opt to live the examined life, and even as they get older, maintain a sense of curiosity about life . Whether through intense conversation or solitary mind-wandering, creatives look at the world around them and want to know why, and how, it is the way it is. They people-watch. Tadamasa Taniguchi via Getty Images Advertisement Observant by nature and curious about the lives of others, creative types often love to people-watch -- and they may generate some of their best ideas from it. \"[Marcel] Proust spent almost his whole life people-watching, and he wrote down his observations, and it eventually came out in his books,\" says Kaufman. \"For a lot of writers, people-watching is very important ... They're keen observers of human nature.\" They take risks. Part of doing creative work is taking risks, and many creative types thrive off of taking risks in various aspects of their lives. Advertisement \"There is a deep and meaningful connection between risk taking and creativity and it's one that's often overlooked,\" contributor Steven Kotler wrote in Forbes . \"Creativity is the act of making something from nothing. It requires making public those bets first placed by imagination. This is not a job for the timid. Time wasted, reputation tarnished, money not well spent -- these are all by-products of creativity gone awry.\" They view all of life as an opportunity for self-expression. Nietzsche believed that one's life and the world should be viewed as a work of art . Creative types may be more likely to see the world this way, and to constantly seek opportunities for self-expression in everyday life. \"Creative expression is self-expression,\" says Kaufman. \"Creativity is nothing more than an individual expression of your needs, desires and uniqueness.\" Advertisement They follow their true passions. Tooga via Getty Images Creative people tend to be intrinsically motivated -- meaning that they're motivated to act from some internal desire, rather than a desire for external reward or recognition. Psychologists have shown that creative people are energized by challenging activities, a sign of intrinsic motivation, and the research suggests that simply thinking of intrinsic reasons to perform an activity may be enough to boost creativity. \"Eminent creators choose and become passionately involved in challenging, risky problems that provide a powerful sense of power from the ability to use their talents,\" write M.A. Collins and T.M. Amabile in The Handbook of Creativity . Advertisement They get out of their own heads. Kaufman argues that another purpose of daydreaming is to help us to get out of our own limited perspective and explore other ways of thinking, which can be an important asset to creative work. \"Daydreaming has evolved to allow us to let go of the present,\" says Kaufman. \"The same brain network associated with daydreaming is the brain network associated with theory of mind -- I like calling it the 'imagination brain network' -- it allows you to imagine your future self, but it also allows you to imagine what someone else is thinking.\" Research has also suggested that inducing \"psychological distance\" -- that is, taking another person's perspective or thinking about a question as if it was unreal or unfamiliar -- can boost creative thinking. Advertisement They lose track of the time. Creative types may find that when they're writing, dancing, painting or expressing themselves in another way, they get \"in the zone,\" or what's known as a flow state , which can help them to create at their highest level. Flow is a mental state when an individual transcends conscious thought to reach a heightened state of effortless concentration and calmness. When someone is in this state, they're practically immune to any internal or external pressures and distractions that could hinder their performance. You get into the flow state when you're performing an activity you enjoy that you're good at, but that also challenges you -- as any good creative project does. \"[Creative people] have found the thing they love, but they've also built up the skill in it to be able to get into the flow state,\" says Kaufman. \"The flow state requires a match between your skill set and the task or activity you're engaging in.\" Advertisement They surround themselves with beauty. Jeremy Woodhouse via Getty Images Creatives tend to have excellent taste, and as a result, they enjoy being surrounded by beauty. A study recently published in the journal Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts showed that musicians -- including orchestra musicians, music teachers, and soloists -- exhibit a high sensitivity and responsiveness to artistic beauty. They connect the dots. If there's one thing that distinguishes highly creative people from others, it's the ability to see possibilities where others don't -- or, in other words, vision. Many great artists and writers have said that creativity is simply the ability to connect the dots that others might never think to connect. Advertisement In the words of Steve Jobs : \u201c\"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.\"\u201d They constantly shake things up. Diversity of experience, more than anything else, is critical to creativity, says Kaufman. Creatives like to shake things up, experience new things, and avoid anything that makes life more monotonous or mundane. \"Creative people have more diversity of experiences, and habit is the killer of diversity of experience,\" says Kaufman. Advertisement They make time for mindfulness. Aleksandra Yakovleva via Getty Images Creative types understand the value of a clear and focused mind -- because their work depends on it. Many artists, entrepreneurs, writers and other creative workers, such as David Lynch , have turned to meditation as a tool for tapping into their most creative state of mind. And science backs up the idea that mindfulness really can boost your brain power in a number of ways. A 2012 Dutch study suggested that certain meditation techniques can promote creative thinking. And mindfulness practices have been linked with improved memory and focus , better emotional well-being , reduced stress and anxiety , and improved mental clarity -- all of which can lead to better creative thought.

Cold Case: Cops Called To Viking Fortress Over Evidence Of Ancient Arson \"All indications are that there has been a fire set at the gates of the castle.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 5, 2016, 03:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The remains of the ring fortress of Vall\u00f8 Borgring in Denmark. Archaeologists believe they have uncovered evidence of ancient arson at the site. Danskebjerge It's one of the coldest cases of all. Police in Denmark have been called to Vall\u00f8 Borgring, the remains of a Viking fortress, over evidence of arson committed more than 1,000 years ago. \" All indications are that there has been a fire set at the gates of the castle ,\" said archaeologist Jens Ulriksen, who is leading the excavation of the fortress, according to Copenhagen Post. \"The outer posts of the east gate are completely charred, and there are signs of burning on the inside.\" Advertisement The ring fortress is the last to have been built by King Harald Bluetooth , who ruled from the mid- to late-900s, according to Archaeology Today.

Watch These Guys Make A Shockingly Huge Model Of Our Solar System It'll make you feel small in the most beautiful way. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Sep 18, 2015, 02:34 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT You've seen models of the the solar system on posters, in textbooks, and in those little mechanical gizmos known as orreries . But these representations are way off--at least when it comes to scale. But now a mind-boggling new video sets us straight by showing in dramatic fashion just how much space our solar takes up. It's way more than you might imagine. Advertisement The video shows LA-based filmmakers Wylie Overstreet and Alex Gorosh building what they say is to-scale model of the solar system across almost 50 square miles of open desert in the Black Rock desert in Nevada. The planets are represented by balls and lightbulbs, the Earth by a marble. Based on that half-an-inch orb of blue glass, they calculated the scale size of each orbit and planet. \"That's what I really wanted to try and capture. We are on a marble floating in the middle of nothing,\" Overstreet says in the video. \"When you sort of come face-to-face with that, it's staggering.\" Advertisement And it really is. If you don't have time to watch the whole video, start around 4:00 to see the breathtaking finale -- it'll make you feel small in the most beautiful way.

Dinosaurs Had Big Trouble Long Before Asteroid Struck: Study \"It is clear that they were already past their prime in an evolutionary sense.\" By Michael McLaughlin Reporter, HuffPost Apr 19, 2016, 05:41 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Dinosaurs were dying off tens of millions of years before an asteroid strike hastened their extinction, according to a new study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The research challenges recent theories that dinosaurs were flourishing 66 million years ago, when a massive asteroid collided with an area in present-day Mexico, resulting in the Chicxulub crater . Advertisement About 50 million years before that cataclysmic event, however, dinosaurs entered a long period of decline, with species dying off faster than new ones emerged, according to researchers from the University of Reading and the University of Bristol, both in England. \"While the asteroid impact is still the prime candidate for the dinosaurs\u2019 final disappearance, it is clear that they were already past their prime in an evolutionary sense,\" Manabu Sakamoto, lead paleontologist from Reading, said in a statement . Scientists have long sought to settle a debate about the dinosaurs' vitality prior to obliteration. Volcanic activity, the shifting of the continents and cooler global temperatures might have have been responsible for this earlier threat to the dinosaurs' survival, the researchers said. Advertisement The sauropods, a group of dinosaurs that included long-necked species like Apatosaurus , were dying out the quickest, researchers said -- though there was not an across-the-board decline. Triceratops , however, were among dinosaurs that thrived. The researchers reached their findings by conducting a statistical analysis and examination of the fossil record from when dinosaurs appeared 231 million years ago to the time when they ceased to exist. Advertisement A study from two years ago concluded that the dinosaurs were at their most vulnerable to environmental change when the asteroid struck, in what is now the Yucatan peninsula -- and may have survived the asteroid if it had occurred a few million years sooner or later, according to the BBC. The newer study conflicts with this 2014 research, which had found no evidence of long-term decline. Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved in the new study, told The Guardian that such a decline may be \"very, very plausible,\" but that doesn\u2019t mean dinosaurs were \"wasting away\" before their demise. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Rather, he said, they could have bounced back. \"It may be that the effects of the asteroid were a bit worse because you had dinosaurs that maybe weren\u2019t as strong in an evolutionary sense as they once had been,\" Brusatte said. \"But I think if there was no asteroid you would still have dinosaurs around today.\" Advertisement Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Memories Still Fresh On 30th Anniversary Of The Challenger Disaster \"The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them,\" said President Ronald Reagan at the time. By Kim Bellware Reporter, HuffPost Jan 28, 2016, 01:05 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Remembrances marking the 30th anniversary of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster poured in Thursday as people recalled where they were when they learned that the shuttle's seven crew members had perished. NASA astronauts Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis and school teacher Christa McAuliffe died after a booster engine failed and the shuttle broke apart just 73 seconds after takeoff. Advertisement Many of the nation's schoolchildren watched live coverage of the widely anticipated launch. President Ronald Reagan postponed the State of the Union address planned for that evening and instead spoke to the country in a stirring address. \"We will never forget them nor the last time we saw them -- this morning -- as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye, and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God,\" he said. Reagan also reminded the nation's schoolchildren the price of discovery: \"The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted. It belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\" Advertisement Two years after the disaster, NASA was accused of trying to cover-up the details of the crews' death, claiming that they likely died instantly rather than upon on impact when the intact cabin crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. McAuliffe's husband, federal judge Steven McAuliffe, told The Associated Press in a statement that the \"Challenger will always be an event that occurred just recently. Our thoughts and memories of Christa will always be fresh and comforting.\" On Thursday, retired astronauts, politicians and others remembered the fateful day in 1986.

Scientists Discover How Bats Land Upside Down \"The more we observe flight behavior in bats, the more we are impressed.\" Reuters Nov 16, 2015, 10:13 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT It is an aerial maneuver far beyond the capabilities of even the most sophisticated modern aircraft: landing upside down on a ceiling. But it is routine business for bats, and now scientists have learned precisely how they do it. Researchers using high-speed cameras to observe bats in a special flight enclosure said on Monday these flying mammals exploit the extra mass of their wings, which are heavy for their body size compared to those of birds and insects, in order to perform the upside-down landing. They land that way in order to roost, as bats do, upside down on cave ceilings or under tree limbs. Advertisement Brown University scientists observed two species: Seba's short-tailed bat and the lesser dog-faced fruit bat. They tracked their motions using three synchronized high-speed video cameras taking images at 1,000 frames per second, and studied weight distribution in the bats' body and wings. They found that by flapping both wings while folding one of them just a bit toward their body, a bat can shift its center of mass to perform a midair flip in order to alight on a ceiling. \"Flying animals all maneuver constantly as they negotiate a three-dimensional environment,\" Brown biology and engineering professor Sharon Swartz said. \"Bats employ this specific maneuver every time they land, because for a bat, landing requires reorienting from head forward, back up, belly down, to head down, toes up.\" Advertisement Selected images from high-speed recordings of C. perspicillata executing a landing maneuver and, upon failing to find a landing site, executing a righting maneuver. (Below) Corresponding 3-D reconstruction of the 52-degree-of-freedom flight kinematics. PLOS Biology When approaching their touchdown spot, bats are not flying very quickly, making it difficult to muster the type of aerodynamic forces generated by pushing against the air that could help position them for an upside-down landing. But their heavy wings enable them instead to generate inertial forces to reorient themselves in midair. \"This is similar to the way in which divers twist and turn during a high dive,\" said Kenny Breuer, a Brown professor of engineering, ecology and evolutionary biology. Advertisement Swartz said bats are generally under-appreciated as skilled aviators because they are primarily nocturnal. \"People have many opportunities to observe birds and insects flying, but the bat world is hidden in the night. The more we observe flight behavior in bats, the more we are impressed,\" Swartz said. The research was published in the journal PLOS Biology .

This Is The Man To Blame For The Term 'Bomb Cyclone' Meteorology professor John Gyakum has stopped using the phrase he helped coin in 1980. Still, he has high hopes for its newfound popularity. By Alexander C. Kaufman Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 3, 2018, 07:18 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING The man who helped invent \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d \u2015 the meteorological term used to describe the intense weather system gripping the East Coast right now \u2015 doesn\u2019t use it anymore. McGill University meteorology professor John Gyakum said he avoids analogies to incendiary weapons in an era where terrorist attacks and major weather events both regularly make headlines. Advertisement \u201cWhen I talk about these explosively developing storms, I go through the trouble of mouthing the terms \u2018explosively developing,\u2019 and I don\u2019t use \u2018bomb,\u2019\u201d Gyakum told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat inappropriate when you consider other aspects of the world right now.\u201d But Gyakum, along with the revered late Massachusetts Institute of Technology meteorologist Fred Sanders, first coined the term in a paper they published in 1980. They used the phrase to describe powerful cyclones that get their energy from rapid drops in pressure caused by hot and cold temperatures colliding. McGill University meteorology professor John Gyakum, who co-authored the paper that first used the term \u201cbomb cyclone.\" McGill University Advertisement The once-obscure piece of meteorological jargon entered the popular lexicon this week as a monster storm, set to pummel the East Coast on Wednesday night into Thursday, formed over the Atlantic Ocean. \u201cB omb cyclone\u201d surged in popularity after The Washington Post published an article Tuesday afternoon comparing the storm to a winter hurricane, warning that winds could reach 70 mph in some parts of New England. A bomb occurs when an extratropical surface cyclone undergoes \u201cbombogenesis,\u201d meaning the central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. As pressure decreases, the storm\u2019s strength intensifies. The name describes the topography of a weather map during such a cyclone. In a high-pressure system, the isobar lines are far apart. But when the pressure suddenly plummets in the middle of a cyclone, the lines are close together, indicating a deep depression. The abstract to the paper that started it all. American Meteorological Society Advertisement Scientists began toying with combining the terms \u201cbomb,\u201d \u201cbombogenesis,\u201d \u201cweather\u201d and \u201cclimatological\u201d in the 1940s, according to Earther . However, Mary Cairns, the Glossary of Meteorology\u2019s chief editor, told HuffPost that the term was absent from the first edition of the American Meteorological Society glossary in 1959. Lance Bosart, Sanders\u2019 first Ph.D. student at MIT, said Sanders used the term \u201cbomb\u201d in 1964. \u201cThat was the first use I had ever heard of the term,\u201d said Bosart, a professor of atmospheric and environmental science at SUNY Albany. \u201cAt the time, I never thought to ask him where it came from. But the term was confined to MIT. When you went somewhere else, it wasn\u2019t used.\u201d Sanders, who died in 2006 at age 83, was a giant of synoptic meteorology \u2015 a field that specializes in large-scale weather events, such as cyclones, fronts and jetstreams \u2015 and is now considered the father of the term \u201cbomb cyclone.\u201d Advertisement In September 1976, Sanders and Gyakum, a student at the time, began a three-year study on the process of bombogenesis. They were building on the work of Tor Bergeron , a Swedish meteorologist who in the 1930s theorized how precipitation forms in clouds. Sanders and Gyakum published their research under the title \u201cSynoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the \u2018Bomb\u2019\u201d in March 1980. The widely cited paper catapulted \u201cbomb\u201d into mainstream meteorology. When the American Meteorological Society updated its glossary in 2000, the term made the cut because it was so commonly used by scientists, professors and National Weather Service officials. \u201cIf the term itself \u2014 \u2018bomb\u2019 \u2014 helps to spur more constructive research, then I\u2019m happy.\u201d - John Gyakum Advertisement Although he avoids using the term himself, Gyakum, 64, said he hopes its newfound popularity will raise awareness about the dangers of bomb cyclones. \u201cA lot of focus in coastal areas is on hurricanes in the summertime,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of time during winter, people say it\u2019s easy, the season is over, we don\u2019t have to worry about hurricane-force winds. But a place like Hilton Head, South Carolina, which had been threatened earlier this year and impacted by a few hurricanes, is particularly prone today to the effects of an explosively developing cyclone.\u201d The number of bomb cyclones varies from year to year. About 40 such events can occur off the northern Atlantic and Pacific coasts each year, according to the National Weather Service. But climate change threatens to make them stronger and more frequent. Advertisement Despite the planet warming overall, northern regions have been hit with a growing number of extreme cold snaps over the past four decades, according to research published last September in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Scientists believe that is because the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and reduced sea ice in the region is allowing the ocean to release more energy. The heat escaping from the surface water is causing the weakening of polar vortex winds that swirl above the Arctic, which normally keep air contained to the polar region. That, as InsideClimate News noted last year, allows the cold polar air to slip southward more often. \u201cThese cold air masses, when they travel over warming waters, the possibility, the probability, of more of these explosively developing cyclones, particularly in populated coastal areas are going to get much more severe,\u201d Gyakum said. In 2014, global sea levels were 2.6 inches above the 1993 average, and continue to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amplifies the destructiveness of bomb cyclones. Advertisement \u201cClimate change is having a potentially big impact on not only the potential strength of these cyclones but also the impacts along coastal areas,\u201d Gyakum said. \u201cEven an ordinary storm is much more dangerous than it was, say, 50 years ago, simply because ocean levels have risen.\u201d Those effects, he said, require more research. \u201cIf the term itself \u2015 \u2018bomb\u2019 \u2015 helps to spur more constructive research,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I\u2019m happy.\u201d But not everyone agrees the term\u2019s sudden popularity is so harmless. \u201cIn terms of trying to convey meteorological features to the general population, putting in words like that could confuse people more, or, for some people, alarm them,\u201d National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini told HuffPost. Advertisement \u201cThese storms are very dangerous,\u201d he added. \u201cThey can cover a large area as they move across the ocean. It\u2019s really important to understand the impacts of these systems.\u201d All day Thursday meteorologists are going to be glued to the new GOES-East satellite watching a truly amazing extratopical \"bomb\" cyclone off New England coast. It will be massive -- fill up entire Western Atlantic off U.S. East Coast. Pressure as low as Sandy & hurricane winds pic.twitter.com/6M4S3y75wT \u2014 Ryan Maue | weather.us (@RyanMaue) January 2, 2018 Another problem is that attention-grabbing phrases often lose their technical meaning when they become part of popular dialogue. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand a bomb cyclone has a very specific meaning,\u201d said Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia\u2019s atmospheric program and a former president of the American Meteorological Society. \u201cNot all nor\u2019easters, and not even all strong nor\u2019easters or blizzards, are bombs.\u201d The National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a storm containing large amounts of snow with winds of 35 mph and visibilities of less than one-quarter of a mile for at least three hours. Yet \u201cyou see people use \u2018blizzards\u2019 for every snowstorm,\u201d Shepherd said, noting that same thing has begun to happen with the phrase \u201cpolar vortex\u201d \u2015 a technical term that gained widespread prominence in early 2014 when the phenomenon brought record cold temperatures and heavy snowfall across the United States and Canada. Advertisement Then there\u2019s the peacenik objection to the term \u201cbomb.\u201d In the early 1980s, a meteorology professor in West Germany publicly scolded Sanders for applying the word to science, according to Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT. \u201cFred\u2019s retort was, \u2018If you don\u2019t like that, what about \u201cfront\u201d? That\u2019s been around for a long time,\u2019\u201d said Emanuel, Sanders\u2019 close friend and colleague since 1981. Then he laughed. \u201cThat opinion was not widely shared.\u201d \u201cBomb cyclone,\u201d however, appears to be sharing far and wide. \u201cAll my social media contacts are asking me about it on Facebook,\u201d said Eric G. Hoffman, a Plymouth State University meteorology professor who co-authored a paper with Sanders in the early 2000s. \u201cIt seems to have caught wildfire today.\u201d Advertisement Related Climate Change huffington post technology Meteorology storms States Across U.S. See Record-Cold New Year's Day As Rest Of The World Boils On New Jersey's Bayshore, Waiting For A Post-Sandy Recovery That Never Came Trump Decides Climate Change Is No Longer A National Security Threat Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Testosterone Therapy Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be, Study Finds \"It's too early to put this stuff in the water supply,\" one researcher says. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 11, 2015, 06:24 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Mark Bowden via Getty Images Millions of men, mostly over the age of 50, are now using testosterone therapy to treat a broad array of symptoms -- erectile dysfunction, weight gain, listlessness -- thought to be caused by low testosterone levels, which the pharmaceutical industry in copious advertising calls \"Low-T.\" But a major new study from a team of researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston -- one of the biggest double-blinded studies of the therapy so far -- indicates that testosterone doesn't work as advertised. Advertisement The team, led by endocrinologist Dr. Shalender Bhasin, gave 306 men over the age of 60, all of whom had low to normal levels of testosterone, either testosterone gel or a placebo every day for three years. And patients who were given testosterone exhibited no more improvement in sexual function or quality of life than the control group. The study's authors posit that \"increasing testosterone levels above the lower limit of the normal range in healthy men does not further improve sexual function.\" Bhasin explained that the benefits of testosterone therapy are clear for men who have \"unequivocally low testosterone\" because of testicular or pituitary issues. Advertisement \"But what our study shows is that middle aged and older men whose testosterone levels are in the normal range -- or slightly below normal -- do not benefit to the same degree, and that they should not indiscriminately use testosterone,\" he said. This finding strikes a blow to the multibillion dollar industry that has sprung up around testosterone in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies and for-profit clinics have reaped huge profits by convincing relatively healthy men that taking supplemental hormones will make them stronger, more attractive and more virile. The study's news wasn't all bad for testosterone. Some earlier studies had suggested that testosterone therapy could put men at higher risk for cardiovascular problems such as heart attack and stroke. But the Brigham and Women's team found that testosterone therapy did not increase their subjects' risk for atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, an important precursor to such cardiovascular events. Advertisement Another major study , published last week, even suggested that effective testosterone therapy could reduce men's risk for cardiovascular events. Unlike the Brigham and Women's study, this one was a not a double-blind, placeboed trial -- the gold standard -- but rather a retrospective analysis of the medical records of approximately 83,000 veterans. Yet it showed a striking reduction in cardiovascular problems among men who got testosterone therapy that increased their testosterone levels to the norm. Yet even Dr. Rajat Barua, the author of the veteran study, admitted that the mechanics connecting testosterone levels and cardiovascular problems are too poorly understood -- and the evidence is too mixed -- to recommend testosterone therapy for cardiovascular issues alone, much less for men with normal testosterone levels. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What Exactly Is The Microwave Doing To Your Food? Here's The Science Don't worry, scientists say microwaved food can be just as nutritious as conventionally cooked food. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Sep 19, 2015, 07:45 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Robert Daly via Getty Images Americans have been using microwave ovens for about 60 years , and we finally seemed convinced that they're safe as well as convenient. But it seems we just can't stop wondering if microwaved foods are somehow less nutritious than the same foods cooked on the stove or in a conventional oven. As it turns out, scientists say, microwaved foods may be more nutritious than you probably thought. Advertisement \"In general, microwaving results in less loss of nutrients compared with boiling and frying,\" Dr. Guy Crosby, adjunct associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, told The Huffington Post in an email, \"because it is a dry method of heating (so water soluble nutrients like many B vitamins and vitamin C are not leached out of the food) and because it is very rapid, so nutrients are exposed to the heat generated by the microwaves for much less time.\" Microwave or not, cooking your food can break down heat-sensitive nutrients, including B vitamins or vitamin C . On the other hand, some nutrients become more potent when exposed to heat. That includes the antioxidant lycopene in tomatoes and certain other vegetables as well as beta-carotene levels in carrots . Heat may break down some nutrients because cooking can damage their chemical structure -- and the longer the food cooks, the more nutrients tend to break down. Advertisement \"Any process that heats a food (microwaving, baking, boiling, frying, etc.) reduces the level of heat sensitive vitamins. The details depend on the time and temperature and the specific vitamin,\" Dr. Don Schaffner, extension specialist in food science and professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, told The Huffington Post in an email. So what's the best cooking method if you're eager to make your meals as nutritious as possible? According to Crosby, steaming may be best, especially for vegetables. And Dr. Susan Nitzke, professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , agrees. \"Cut food into large pieces and cook rapidly, shortly before serving,\" she told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Steaming and microwaving are examples of rapid cooking methods.\" Advertisement Meanwhile, Dr. Ashim Datta, professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., told HuffPost Science that there is no \"best\" cooking method. \"It depends on the food, the cooking method, the appliance and so on,\" he said. \"In general, the principles are that if you are boiling in water, lots of nutrients can leach out. If you are heating in a microwave without water, and because the heating is done quicker, it doesn't have time to destroy as many nutrients... but beyond that, we cannot make general conclusions.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Computers Can Now Read Our Body Language Scientists have rigged up computers to detect boredom based on movement. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 9, 2016, 12:42 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT In the future, this man's laptop might be able to tell that he's bored. DTP via Getty Images Bored with the Excel spreadsheet or work emails on the screen in front of you? Your laptop will one day be able to tell, according to new research. Researchers have developed a program that allows a computer to read your body language and determine whether you're bored or interested by what you see on the screen. Advertisement The University of Sussex findings, published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Psychology , showed that measuring a person's involuntary movements as they use a computer can reveal whether they are absorbed in what they're doing. Involuntary movements are tiny micro-movements that we constantly make. They include movements in the neck, face and limbs -- such as fiddling the hands, crossing the legs, shifting our gaze and turning the neck. If we're bored or unengaged, we'll make more of these movements. When we're interested in what we're doing -- which the researchers refer to as \"rapt engagement\" -- we make fewer involuntary movements. Advertisement \u201cPeople naturally make involuntary movements about once every 10 seconds -- this is the background 'movement of life.'\"\u201d - Dr. Harry Witchel, the study's lead author \"It's the same as when a small child, who is normally constantly on the go, stares gaping at cartoons on the television without moving a muscle,\" Dr. Harry Witchel, a body language expert at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and the study's lead author, explained in a statement . For the research, 27 healthy participants sat in front of a computer with speakers. The participants were presented with a range of stimuli that ranged from enthralling to utterly boring over the course of three minutes -- \"fascinating games to tedious readings from EU banking regulation.\" Advertisement Meanwhile, the researchers used a handheld sensor device to track the participants' involuntary hand movements over the three-minute period. The movements were then measured and analyzed with video motion tracking. They also compared involuntary hand movements during two reading tasks, one engaging and one non-engaging, and found that the engaging reading task resulted in 42 percent fewer involuntary hand movements. \"People naturally make involuntary movements about once every 10 seconds -- this is the background 'movement of life,'\" Witchel said. \"What we showed is that when people are engaged with what is on a computer screen -- particularly when they are interested -- they inhibit their non-instrumental movements. People even inhibit their leg movements.\" Advertisement These findings could help computers to better detect a person's engagement level, potentially leading to improvements in digital learning. For instance, a tutoring program that adapts to the user's interest level could change its strategies when it detects the student becoming disenga ged. The findings also have important implications for the development of artificial intelligence. According to Witchel, the research could one day help scientists to create more empathetic robots that are able to react to a person's level of engagement. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Feds Scrap Grand Vision To Expand Marine Sanctuary In Hawaii After six years of planning, NOAA failed to secure necessary state support. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 27, 2016, 10:53 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT After six years of planning, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has withdrawn its proposal to expand the size and focus of the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary . In addition to enlarging the sanctuary from 1,366 square miles to 1,601 square miles, the proposal would have allowed it to protect more marine species -- not only the humpback whale -- by shifting to an ecosystem-based management approach. NOAA said it decided to abandon the project in the face of opposition from the state of Hawaii, which co-manages the sanctuary and must sign off on any changes. Advertisement Allen Tom, regional director of NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, told The Huffington Post that the inability of state and federal agencies to agree was disappointing, but not surprising. \"Certainly going out to the public, we got an earful,\" he said. A humpback whale mother and calf swim off the coast of Hawaii. Robinson Ed via Getty Images Established by Congress in 1992 , the national sanctuary lies within the shallow, warm waters surrounding the main Hawaiian islands -- one of the world's most important humpback whale habitats. Advertisement Each year between November and May, as many as 10,000 humpback whales return from their summer feeding grounds in Alaska to the warmer waters of Hawaii to mate and give birth. After being pushed to the brink of extinction, the North Pacific humpback population has increased drastically over the last half-century. In 1966, the year commercial whaling was banned in the North Pacific, the population had been reduced to fewer than 1,400. Current estimates put their numbers at around 20,000. While the recovery of the species is a success story, the sanctuary recognized the need to pivot its attention to a more holistic approach. Advertisement \"Managing a single species is not the way management is done, either on land or in the water,\" Tom said. \"We were trying to evolve to a much broader approach of managing some of these endangered animals as well as the resources in the ocean.\" The state, however, argued the proposal went too far. Suzanne Case, head of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resource, outlined the state's concerns in a Jan. 22 letter to John Armor, acting director of NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. \"As the trustee of Hawaii\u2019s natural resources, cultural resources, and submerged lands, the State of Hawaii supports an ecosystem-based management approach, but cannot endorse federal jurisdiction or enforcement of Hawaiian waters at this scale,\" Case wrote. Advertisement NOAA NOAA's proposal came under fire from Hawaii residents concerned the plan and its associated regulations would restrict recreational ocean use and hurt business. Fishing groups opposed the proposal\u2019s call to increase protective areas for Hawaiian monk seals, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The NOAA proposal, introduced publicly in March , was six years in the making, according to Tom. He didn't have an estimate of the costs involved, but said NOAA \"spent a fair amount of time and energy\" on it. Advertisement \"But again, our mandate says that if we are working with states and in state waters, that the governor and state have the final say as to what we do,\" Tom said. \"If the state's not comfortable, or if they're not on board with our proposal, then it is wise for us to just sort of save everybody any more time and money on this.\" The sanctuary says it will continue in its present form, conserving and protecting humpback whales and providing needed research support and public education. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

A Highly Classified Spy Satellite Has Been Destroyed. Probably. It's either a complete loss, or a frighteningly evasive spacecraft. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Jan 9, 2018, 06:06 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING SpaceX launched a classified, multibillion-dollar spy satellite for the U.S. government on Sunday \u2015 and then something went wrong. Probably. Unnamed government officials told Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal that the satellite, built by Northrop Grumman under the code-name \u201cZuma,\u201d failed to reach orbit and crashed back into the atmosphere. Advertisement Due to the highly classified nature of the payload, however, it\u2019s unclear what exactly happened. (We don\u2019t even know which government agency commissioned Zuma in the first place, which is rare. ) SpaceX declined to comment on the particulars, but in a statement to HuffPost was adamant there was no failure on its end. As evidence, here\u2019s the Falcon 9 rocket\u2019s first stage returning safely back to Earth, as planned, just under eight minutes after launch: Advertisement \u201cFor clarity: after review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on Sunday night,\u201d SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said in a statement emailed to HuffPost. \u201cIf we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately,\u201d Shotwell added. \u201cInformation published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible.\u201d SpaceX noted it has a number of launches and tests scheduled for the next several weeks, which it would have immediately postponed had something gone wrong Sunday. Advertisement Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, notes the rocket seems to have launched something, and that it completed at least one orbit: Space-Track has cataloged the Zuma payload as USA 280, international designation 2018-001A. Catalog number 43098. No orbit details given. No reentry date given, but for a secret payload it might not be. Implication is Space-Track thinks it completed at least one orbit \u2014 Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) January 9, 2018 While conspiracy-minded individuals have been quick to note a spy satellite suddenly disappearing seems perfectly in line with what a spy satellite might be designed to do, McDowell says that\u2019s unlikely. Advertisement I see a lot of people suggesting that the loss of Zuma is a front, a cover to hide a successful insertion in a secret orbit or some other scam. This is JUST NOT PLAUSIBLE for many reasons. I am confident other experts on the subject will agree with me. \u2014 Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) January 9, 2018 If Zuma did indeed fail, it\u2019s possible the payload adapter Northrop Grumman built to deploy the satellite from the rocket itself malfunctioned. According to documents obtained by Wired , the company built its own payload adapter instead of using hardware provided by SpaceX. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Molten Salt In Water Goes Kaboom, Like We Hoped It Would \"On the third try ...

But the video above isn't about any practical application. It's about blowing stuff up. In the video, which was posted to YouTube on Monday, the Backyard Scientist gives us a big bang in slow-mo by pouring the fired-up molten salt into an aquarium full of water.

Happy Fourth of July, America -- Love, Space Astronomers have spotted a brilliant \"fireworks\" display millions of light years away. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 4, 2016, 08:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT \"And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in ...\" Ursa Major?! Just in time for Independence Day, astronomers released an image of a dazzling \" fireworks display \u201d full of reds, whites and blues -- some 82 million light years from Earth. Here's a look at the celestial marvel: Kiso 5639, a dwarf galaxy about 82 million light years from Earth, resembles a rocket. NASA, ESA, and D. Elmegreen (Vassar College) NASA's Hubble Space Telescope spotted the spectacle, which is actually a dwarf galaxy named Kiso 5639. It \"resembles a July 4th skyrocket,\" complete with a \"brilliant blazing head and a long, star-studded tail,\" NASA said in a release. Advertisement Kiso 5639 is also known as a \"tadpole\" galaxy, a reference to its elongated shape. Such galaxies are common at far-off distances, but Kiso 5639 is a rare, (relatively) nearby example, according to NASA. Debra Elmegreen, an astronomer at Vassar College who conducted detailed imaging of the galaxy, described it as a \" beautiful, up-close example of what must have been common long ago.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

A Giant Gas Cloud Is Coming Toward Us At 700,000 Miles Per Hour We only have 30 million years until it plows into the Milky Way. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Jan 29, 2016, 12:18 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT This visualization of the Smith Cloud shows its size compared to the size of the Earth's moon. Saxton/Lockman/NRAO/AUI/NSF/Mellinger An invisible cloud of gas is speeding toward our Milky Way galaxy at 700,000 miles per hour. But don't worry: It will take about 30 million years to get here. It's a case of \u201c what goes up must come down ,\" according to Hubble Space Telescope astronomers who say the space cloud likely originated in our galaxy and is boomeranging back. When it returns, they predict \"a spectacular burst of star formation, perhaps providing enough gas to make 2 million suns.\" Advertisement Astronomers are aware of many space clouds, but the Smith Cloud is unique because its trajectory is well-known . \u201cThe cloud is an example of how the galaxy is changing with time,\u201d said Andrew Fox of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. \u201cIt\u2019s telling us that the Milky Way is a bubbling, very active place where gas can be thrown out of one part of the disk and then return back down into another. These images show the trajectory of the Smith Cloud, including its predicted return to the Milky Way in 30 million years. NASA/ESA/A. Feild (STScI) Advertisement Doctoral astronomy student Gail Smith discovered the Smith Cloud in the 1960s. Researchers believe it is 11,000 light-years long and 2,500 light-years across. Fox and his team recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to learn about the cloud's chemical composition and origin. According to Hubblesite.org : The astronomers found that the Smith Cloud is as rich in sulfur as the Milky Way's outer disk, a region about 40,000 light-years from the galaxy's center (about 15,000 light-years farther out than our sun and solar system). This means that the Smith Cloud was enriched by material from stars. This would not happen if it were pristine hydrogen from outside the galaxy, or if it were the remnant of a failed galaxy devoid of stars. Instead, the cloud appears to have been ejected from within the Milky Way and is now boomeranging back. How the space cloud was catapulted from the Milky Way in the first place -- and what has kept it together -- remain unknown. Only more research will tell. The astronomers' findings appear in this month's edition of The Astrophysical Journal Letters .

Scientists May Have Figured Out The Best Hand-Sanitizing Technique This six-step process using alcohol rub won out in a study of health care workers. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Apr 18, 2016, 11:18 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists in Scotland may have discovered the most effective way to blast bacteria from health care workers' hands. They say a thorough six-step technique using an alcohol-based hand rub, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is the best method. Watch how it's done: Advertisement Jacqui Reilly , a professor of infection prevention and control at Glasgow Caledonian University , led a study observing how 42 doctors and 72 nurses used the rub and cleaned their hands after treating patients. For the research, which was published this month in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology , scientists recorded how long it took the health care workers to wash their hands , as well as their pre- and post-washing median bacterial counts. The health care workers who performed the six-step technique took an average of 42.5 seconds and reduced their median bacterial count from 3.28 to 2.58. Advertisement Those who used a three-step technique -- applying the alcohol-based product to one hand, rubbing their hands together until they were fully covered, then rubbing until they were dry -- spent 7.5 seconds less on the process. Their median bacterial count lowered from 3.08 to an average of 2.88. Reilly said that there had previously been \"limited evidence on which technique is most effective\" and that this study provided \" a foundation for effective best practices to implement on the front lines of healthcare.\" Before You Go LOADING ERROR LOADING Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Oklahoma Sets New Limits For Oil And Gas Drillers To Halt Earthquakes Companies may be forced to reduce production to comply. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 8, 2016, 12:56 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Oklahoma regulators have imposed drastic new limits for wastewater injections that are a byproduct of oil and gas wells. Credit: J Pat Carter/Getty Images The number and intensity of earthquakes in Oklahoma have risen dramatically in recent years with the underground disposal of wastes from oil and gas drilling. The state has asked energy companies to reduce wastewater disposal by 40 percent. The new guidelines cover more than 400 wells located in a 5,000-square-mile area. Oklahoma officials on Monday told oil and gas producers to dramatically scale back underground disposal of wastewater that has led to a dramatic surge in the number and intensity of earthquakes. Advertisement The new restrictions , imposed by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, will require drillers to cut the amount of underground-injected wastewater by 40 percent from the peak in 2014. The move represents a shift in strategy for the state, which had initially targeted individual wells linked to seismic activity, said Matt Skinner, a spokesman for the commission. \"We've built the case we need based on broad correlations rather than specific,\" Skinner said. \"We can't look at a single well and say, 'You did this.'\" The New York Times notes the restrictions are technically recommendations that may force energy companies to produce less oil and gas. They follow a similar move for wells in northwest Oklahoma imposed by the state last month. Advertisement Earthquakes in the industry-friendly state, recently linked to drillers' injection of wastewater deep underground, have risen from a few dozen annually in the mid-2000s to more than 6,000 last year . The waste is a byproduct of petroleum production, forced from the ground with oil and gas. Energy companies have been injecting the material thousands of feet underground into an area called the Arbuckle formation. A website tracking quakes across the state shows a near constant stream of seismic events . Oklahoma was hit with its third-strongest earthquake in recorded history , a magnitude 5.1 event, just last month. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Skinner said the restrictions are a proactive approach by the state. The 5,000-square-mile area in central Oklahoma covered by the new rules includes areas where earthquakes aren't happening. Advertisement Skinner said the injections aren't directly caused by the method of producing oil and gas called fracking. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says Oklahoma's massive energy business can produce up to 2 billion gallons of wastewater a day.

Space Debris To Collide With Earth On Friday The 13th But don't worry. Jim Wild, Lancaster University \u2014 The Conversation Nov 12, 2015, 08:38 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT According to the European Space Agency, something is going to fall to Earth on Friday, 13 November. A mysterious piece of space debris named WT1190F is predicted to re-enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at around 06:20 GMT in the skies above the Indian Ocean. While it\u2019s expected to burn up in the atmosphere about 100km off the south coast of Sri Lanka, it is not impossible that smaller fragments could crash onto the surface. The object must be the remains from a previous space mission, most likely a spent rocket from one of the recent robotic moon missions or even a relic from the Apollo era. But while it may seem like a bad omen, scientists are excited. It is notoriously difficult to predict exactly where debris that fall to the Earth will hit, so the opportunity to study the trajectory of WT1190F could help improve current methods. Advertisement A display of fireballs The object was first spotted by the Catalina Sky Survey in 2013, swinging within 250,000km of the Earth before plunging back out into space to a distance of around half a million kilometers, twice as far away as the moon. But its elliptical orbit is unstable and the altitude of the object\u2019s closest approach to the Earth has been falling. On Friday, this will cause it to dip into the atmosphere while moving at a speed of several kilometers per second. When this happens, atmospheric drag will slow it down and cause it to fall from orbit while the frictional effect of the air rushing past will pummel, heat and vaporize the object. Object WT1190F, the fast-moving white spot in the middle. European Space Agency According to astronomers who have estimated its size and density, the object is about 1-2 meters in diameter and hollow. Luckily that means it is too small and fragile to be likely to make it to the surface. As it disintegrates, the smaller fragments will rapidly burn up creating a brilliant display of fireballs that may be visible streaking across the midday sky to the south of Sri Lanka. Only very small fragments, if anything, will splashdown in the Indian Ocean. There simply isn\u2019t enough mass involved for this to be a cause for too much concern. Advertisement We know this because it is by no means the first human-made object to fall from orbit, nor is it the largest. When the 135-tonne Russian Mir space station came to end of its life in 2001, most of the massive station vaporized during re-entry, some fragments fell harmlessly into the South Pacific Ocean. The difficulty in predicting a crash site However, it is not always easy to predict. When it became clear that NASA\u2019s 75-tonne Skylab space station was going to re-enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in July 1979, NASA estimated that the chances of a human being hit somewhere on the planet was one in 152. Ultimately, instead of re-entering over the ocean south-east of South Africa while speeding eastwards, Skylab burned up slightly later than expected and fragments fell to Earth south-east of Perth, in Western Australia. While nobody was injured, Skylab\u2019s demise highlighted uncertainties in the re-entry estimates of the day. Skylab turned out to be sturdier than expected, meaning the drag of the tumbling space station had been miscalculated. Advertisement The 82 tonne Skylab space station re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 11th July 1979 and parts of it hit the Earth in Western Australia. Many large pieces were retrieved. Science & Society Picture Library via Getty Images Skylab also highlighted the important effect that mother nature has on such orbits. It had originally been thought that the space station, launched in May 1973, would remain in orbit for around nine years. But greater than expected solar activity in the 1970s resulted in increased heating and expansion of the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. The resulting extra drag on the space station slowed it and caused its orbit to descend more quickly than predicted . Nowadays, the influence of solar activity of the near-Earth space environment is dubbed \u201cspace weather\u201d and its impact on low-Earth orbiting objects is the focus of considerable research. As well as studying how it can increase the atmospheric drag on satellites and manned spacecraft, there is considerable interest in how it can alter the trajectory of space debris \u2013 a catch-all description that includes everything from rocket boosters and long-dead satellites to nuts and bolts. Surveys using ground-based radar have revealed more than 21,000 objects larger than 10cm in Earth orbit . Meanwhile, the estimated number of particles between 1cm and 10cm in diameter is about 500,000, while the number of particles smaller than 1cm runs into many millions. Advertisement Being able to predict how the orbits of these objects will evolve is important to avoid future high-speed collisions between space debris and orbiting satellites or manned spacecraft. It is also vital to national defense agencies, who need to be able to discriminate between incoming space debris and inter-continental ballistic missiles. But having filled the space surrounding our planet with an orbiting cloud of junk, best practice is now to design an end-of-life \u201cexit strategy\u201d into modern satellites. Typically this involves a planned and controlled de-orbit, usually resulting in the complete destruction of the satellite in the upper atmosphere, or a planned maneuver into a stable graveyard orbit, tucked safely out of harm\u2019s ways beyond geostationary orbit. So should we be worried about WT1190F? No. Friday the 13th is going to be a bad day for that particular piece of space junk, but for researchers it\u2019s a piece of good fortune. Simulations and predictions have come a long way since Skylab\u2019s day and if the measurements made so far are correct, this is a relatively lightweight piece of debris and is very likely to burn up in a predictable fashion over in a well-defined area. Nevertheless, scientists will be monitoring WT1190F\u2019s predicted re-entry zone carefully to gather data in an effort to improve our understanding of the physics of re-entry even further.

New Year Kicks Off With Supermoon Lunapalooza 2018's biggest supermoon will be followed at the end of January by a \"super blue blood moon.\" By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Dec 30, 2017, 08:43 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING No matter what the rest of the New Year brings, earthlings are in for a double treat in January with the appearance of two supermoons . The first one rises the night of New Year\u2019s Day. The second \u2014 a bound-to-be-memorable \u201csuper blue blood moon\u201d \u2014 comes the last night of the month, topped off by a lunar eclipse. A supermoon is a full moon that appears at the perigee, the closest point in the moon\u2019s orbit to Earth. Supermoons appear to be about 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than full moons that appear at the apogee, the farthest point in the orbit, according to NASA. Advertisement A supermoon is coming! On Jan. 1, the full Moon will be at or near its closest point in its orbit around Earth, making it a supermoon. Bundle up, get outside and look up! https://t.co/c0Ox5CDvmf Follow @NASAMoon for more lunar facts! pic.twitter.com/TH9H8Ly1V9 \u2014 NASA (@NASA) December 29, 2017 The January supermoons are the end of a trilogy of big moon treats that began Dec. 3 with a full cold moon (a December full moon) that made for some spectacular photos. Supermoons hang around all night, are easy to see and are not damaging to the eyes, no matter how long you moon-gaze. They often appear at their most spectacular as they rise and set , NASA notes. Advertisement The Jan. 1 supermoon will be the biggest of the year. The moon will appear to be oversized for a few nights after that, though will no longer be a full moon. Full Wolf Moon: New Year's Supermoon Is the Biggest of the Year https://t.co/nPzynAFyCd pic.twitter.com/d3LE1p29Pp \u2014 Live Science (@LiveScience) December 30, 2017 For those still nursing a hangover the night of Jan. 1, an even more intriguing supermoon will rise the night of Jan. 31. That will be the second full moon of the month, which is usually called a \u201cblue moon\u201d because a double full-moon month occurs essentially once in a blue moon \u2014 about every 2\u00bd years. A blue moon is even rarer when it\u2019s a supermoon. Advertisement But that won\u2019t be the only rarity that night. The super blue moon will also occur during a total lunar eclipse, when the Earth moves between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun\u2019s light from reflecting off the moon. If skies are clear, the total eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia across the Pacific Ocean to western North America. Lunar eclipses make moons appear blood red because of the way the blocked sunlight bends. So prepare yourself for the super blue blood moon the night of the lunar eclipse. To get the full effect of the lunar eclipse, watch at moonset, NASA advises. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA's Spacecraft Juno Begins Orbit Of Jupiter Five years and hundreds of millions of miles later, Juno is in orbit. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 4, 2016, 03:49 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA\u2019s solar-powered Juno spacecraft reached Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Credit: NASA UPDATE: 11:54 p.m. ET -- \"Welcome to Jupiter!\" After a tense, 35-minute engine burn, NASA's Juno spacecraft successfully began its orbit of Jupiter late Monday evening, the pivotal moment of the space agency's five-year long venture to reach the planet. Success! Engine burn complete. #Juno is now orbiting #Jupiter , poised to unlock the planet's secrets. https://t.co/YFsOJ9YYb5 \u2014 NASA (@NASA) July 5, 2016 Advertisement Hundreds of millions of miles away, the $1.1 billion mission all hung on a single 35-minute engine burn -- a maneuver that slowed the spacecraft during its final approach and allowed the craft to sink into orbit around the solar system's largest planet. \" Jupiter is spectacular from afar and will be absolutely breathtaking from close up,\" Scott Bolton, principal investigator of Juno from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a statement ahead of Monday night's events. The solar-powered spacecraft entered the gas giant's dangerous orbit Monday, just seconds behind schedule, to raucous applause from those gathered at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Advertisement NASA reported less than an hour later that Juno had turned its solar panels towards the sun for power, the last crucial move undertaken during the initial phase of the orbit. Engine burn complete and orbit obtained. I\u2019m ready to unlock all your secrets, #Jupiter . Deal with it. \u2014 NASA's Juno Mission (@NASAJuno) July 5, 2016 The 35-minute engine burn, which began at 11:18 p.m. EST, slowed Juno by 1,212 mph, enough so it could be captured by the planet's gravitational pull. Still, Juno was traveling some 130,000 mph before it reached Jupiter. Advertisement \" We've only got one shot ,\" Guy Beutelschies, director of space exploration systems at Lockheed Martin, the company that built and operates Juno , told NPR. \"If we miss this flyby, we're assuming the mission's over.\" But the Fourth of July arrival proved successful. Now, Juno will continue a lengthy dance with Jupiter, circling the giant planet 37 times over a 20-month period and swinging as close as 2,600 miles of the planet's cloud tops, NASA said. It will mark the first time a spacecraft has orbited Jupiter's poles, NASA added, \" providing new answers to ongoing mysteries about the planet\u2019s core, composition and magnetic fields.\" The mission is also expected to provide scientists with a better understanding of our solar system as a whole. Advertisement \"It just so happens, deep inside this body are the secrets we're after,\" a voice-over says in the NASA video below. \"Secrets about our early solar system.\" The heavily armored spacecraft has been built to withstand the planet's extreme, radiation-rich environment. But the costly mission is full of unknowns. Advertisement \"When you sail into terra incognita, that is always going to make you sit on the edge of your seat , because you don\u2019t really know for sure what you\u2019re facing,\" Heidi Becker of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory told National Geographic. Juno is expected to begin scientific observations following a final engine burn on Oct. 19, after a lengthy phase in which the spacecraft will be captured in the planet\u2019s orbit and all scientific instruments will be turned on. The spacecraft is set to meet a fiery death when it burns up in Jupiter's atmosphere in February 2018. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
