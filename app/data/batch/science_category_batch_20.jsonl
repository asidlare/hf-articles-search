These NASA Space Tourism Posters Take Us To Infinity And Beyond Is this what our vacations may one day look like? By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 13, 2016, 12:21 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING These spectacular space tourism posters imagine what advertisements for interplanetary vacations could one day look like. Fourteen tongue-in-cheek trips to Mars, Jupiter, Venus and a host of exoplanets are on offer in the Visions of the Future series that NASA commissioned at its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Advertisement \"Imagination is our window into the future,\" said NASA, which uploaded the posters to its website on Wednesday. JPL visual strategist Dan Goods told CNN the images were meant to spark people's interest in the universe. Advertisement \"Many of the things we are doing today were imagined by artists and science fiction writers decades ago,\" he said . \"These destinations are all actual places that we know about, and one day, perhaps humans can go to them in the future.\" Although deep space travel for humans may seem a long way off, Goods said it's \"really important to us that we worked with the technical community to make sure what we were showing could someday happen.\" NASA commissioned the Seattle design studio Invisible Creature to create three of the posters -- of \"Mars,\" \"Enceladus\" and \"The Grand Tour.\" The space agency released five others as part of JPL's Exoplanet Travel Bureau series in 2015. Advertisement High-definition versions of the posters are available to download for free from the JPL website . And here they are: The Grand Tour NASA/JPL-Caltech NASA's Voyager mission took advantage of a once-every-175-year alignment of the outer planets for a grand tour of the solar system. The twin spacecraft revealed details about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- using each planet's gravity to send them on to the next destination. Voyager set the stage for such ambitious orbiter missions as Galileo to Jupiter and Cassini to Saturn. Today both Voyager spacecraft continue to return valuable science from the far reaches of our solar system. Mars NASA/JPL-Caltech This poster imagines a future day when NASA has achieved its vision of human exploration of Mars and takes a nostalgic look back at the great imagined milestones of Mars exploration that will someday be celebrated as historic sites. Ceres NASA/JPL-Caltech Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the Sun. It is the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with an equatorial diameter of about 965 kilometers. After being studied with telescopes for more than two centuries, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to be explored by a spacecraft, when NASA's Dawn probe arrived in orbit in March 2015. Dawn's ongoing detailed observations are revealing intriguing insights into the nature of this mysterious world of ice and rock. Advertisement Europa NASA/JPL-Caltech Astonishing geology and the potential to host the conditions for simple life make Jupiter's moon Europa a fascinating destination for future exploration. Beneath its icy surface, Europa is believed to conceal a global ocean of salty liquid water twice the volume of Earth's oceans. Tugging and flexing from Jupiter's gravity generates enough heat to keep the ocean from freezing. On Earth, wherever we find water, we find life. What will NASA's Europa mission find when it heads for this intriguing moon in the 2020s. First Exoplanet NASA/JPL-Caltech While there is much debate over which exoplanet discovery is considered the \"first,\" one stands out from the rest. In 1995, scientists discovered 51 Pegasi b, forever changing the way we see the universe and our place in it. The exoplanet is about half the mass of Jupiter, with a seemingly impossible, star-hugging orbit of only 4.2 Earth days. Not only was it the first planet confirmed to orbit a sun-like star, it also ushered in a whole new class of planets called Hot Jupiters: hot, massive planets orbiting closer to their stars than Mercury. Today, powerful observatories like NASA's Kepler space telescope will continue the hunt of distant planets. Venus NASA/JPL-Caltech The rare science opportunity of planetary transits has long inspired bold voyages to exotic vantage points \u00e2 journeys such as James Cook's trek to the South Pacific to watch Venus and Mercury cross the face of the Sun in 1769. Spacecraft now allow us the luxury to study these cosmic crossings at times of our choosing from unique locales across our solar system. Advertisement Earth NASA/JPL-Caltech There's no place like home. Warm, wet and with an atmosphere that's just right, Earth is the only place we know of with life -- and lots of it. JPL's Earth science missions monitor our home planet and how it's changing so it can continue to provide a safe haven as we reach deeper into the cosmos. Enceladus NASA/JPL-Caltech The discovery of Enceladus' icy jets and their role in creating Saturn's E-ring is one of the top findings of the Cassini mission to Saturn. Further Cassini mission discoveries revealed strong evidence of a global ocean and the first signs of potential hydrothermal activity beyond Earth -- making this tiny Saturnian moon one of the leading locations in the search for possible life beyond Earth. Jupiter NASA/JPL-Caltech The Jovian cloudscape boasts the most spectacular light show in the solar system, with northern and southern lights to dazzle even the most jaded space traveler. Jupiter's auroras are hundreds of times more powerful than Earth's, and they form a glowing ring around each pole that's bigger than our home planet. Revolving outside this auroral oval are the glowing, electric footprints of Jupiter's three largest moons. NASA's Juno mission will observe Jupiter's auroras from above the polar regions, studying them in a way never before possible. Advertisement Kepler-16b NASA/JPL-Caltech Like Luke Skywalker's planet \"Tatooine\" in Star Wars, Kepler-16b orbits a pair of stars. Depicted here as a terrestrial planet, Kepler-16b might also be a gas giant like Saturn. Prospects for life on this unusual world aren't good, as it has a temperature similar to that of dry ice. But the discovery indicates that the movie's iconic double-sunset is anything but science fiction. Kepler-186f NASA/JPL-Caltech Kepler-186f is the first Earth-size planet discovered in the potentially \"habitable zone\" around another star, where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. Its star is much cooler and redder than our Sun. If plant life does exist on a planet like Kepler-186f, its photosynthesis could have been influenced by the star's red-wavelength photons, making for a color palette that's very different than the greens on Earth. This discovery was made by Kepler, NASA's planet hunting telescope. PSO J318.5-22 NASA/JPL-Caltech Discovered in October 2013 using direct imaging, PSO J318.5-22 belongs to a special class of planets called rogue, or free-floating, planets. Wandering alone in the galaxy, they do not orbit a parent star. Not much is known about how these planets come to exist, but scientists theorize that they may be either failed stars or planets ejected from very young systems after an encounter with another planet. These rogue planets glow faintly from the heat of their formation. Once they cool down, they will be dancing in the dark. Advertisement A Super Earth NASA/JPL-Caltech Twice as big in volume as the Earth, HD 40307g straddles the line between \"Super-Earth\" and \"mini-Neptune\" and scientists aren't sure if it has a rocky surface or one that's buried beneath thick layers of gas and ice. One thing is certain though: at eight time the Earth's mass, its gravitational pull is much, much stronger. Titan NASA/JPL-Caltech Frigid and alien, yet similar to our own planet billions of years ago, Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere, organic-rich chemistry and a surface shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane. Cold winds sculpt vast regions of hydrocarbon-rich dunes. There may even be cryovolcanoes of cold liquid water. NASA's Cassini orbiter was designed to peer through Titan's perpetual haze and unravel the mysteries of this planet-like moon.

By Hillary Rosner For someone who\u2019s been immersed in the scary realities of global warming for so long, Cullen is surprisingly optimistic. Marius Bugge According to a recent Yale survey, 7 in 10 Americans believe global warming is real and \u00adhappening. And 6 in 10 believe it is affecting U.S. weather . But only 1 in 3 say they\u2019ve personally felt its effects. That disconnect stuck with Heidi Cullen. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to think of it as an issue that\u2019s urgent unless you recognize the fact that you\u2019re already being impacted,\u201d says Cullen, chief scientist for the nonprofit Climate Central. Now in its ninth year, Climate Central is part research hub and part journalism outfit \u2014 an unusual hybrid that tries to connect climate change to people\u2019s lives. The organization\u2019s latest project, World Weather \u00adAttribution, identifies direct links between extreme weather events and global warming. Cullen and her team created the program after realizing that while the tools for attributing such events have evolved, the results were coming out too late to influence the conversation. \u00adCullen also worried that media covering extreme weather operated off outdated information: They would say you couldn\u2019t tie any specific event to climate change. \u201cNow the techniques exist,\u201d Cullen says. So she set out to provide objective answers, swiftly. Researchers from Climate Central and other institutions around the world combine information from climate models, on-the-ground observations, and a range of peer-reviewed research to supply evidence for their reports. Recently, her team determined that global warming made 2017\u2019s exceptionally warm February in the U.S. at least three times more likely. Advertisement \u201cConnecting science to regular people\u2019s lives is second nature to Cullen, but that wasn\u2019t always the case.\u201d Connecting science to regular people\u2019s lives is second nature to Cullen, but that wasn\u2019t always the case. Back in 2002, when she was forecasting droughts at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, \u00adColorado, a producer from the Weather Channel called. They \u00adwanted to hire a climate expert to appear on air. It was four years before An Inconvenient Truth, and many Americans were just opening their eyes to global warming. \u201cIt seemed like a really important moment,\u201d Cullen says. She packed up and headed for Atlanta. Advertisement Cullen arrived at the Weather Channel a complete communication novice, unsure of how to convey any scientific info \u00adsuccinctly, and clueless about makeup and other \u00adaccoutrement of television personalities. She would submit scripts for short segments to the producers, \u201cand they would shake their heads\u201d at the overly complex, jargon-laden writing, she recalls. \u201cI\u2019d walk down the hallway, and they would start singing \u2018She Blinded Me with Science.\u2019\u201d Eventually, though, Cullen became a pro, earning her own weekly show. In 2008, Princeton ecologist Stephen \u00adPacala contacted her about joining Climate \u00adCentral. Her first project was a program to enable \u00admeteorologists to connect the dots between local weather and global warming. For World Weather Attribution, Cullen is as likely to do the research that will be used in reports as write up results based on others\u2019 investigations. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Whales Are Mysteriously Dying In Alaska \"We do not yet know the cause of these strandings.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Aug 21, 2015, 01:06 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Bears are seen feeding on the carcass of a fin whale which washed up in Larson Bay, Alaska, near Kodiak in June 2015. NOAA Whales are turning up dead along the Alaska coast in alarming numbers, and scientists so far have no idea what's causing it. Since May, 30 whales have been found dead along the coast, causing the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to declare and \"unusual mortality event\" on Thursday. Advertisement So far, the toll includes 11 fin whales, 14 humpback whales, one gray whale, and four unidentified cetaceans, according to the agency. That compares to just five dead whales in all of last year. \"NOAA Fisheries scientists and partners are very concerned about the large number of whales stranding in the western Gulf of Alaska in recent months,\" Dr. Teri Rowles, NOAA Fisheries' marine mammal health and stranding response coordinator, said in a news release. Rowles added: \"While we do not yet know the cause of these strandings, our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live. Members of the public can greatly assist the investigation by immediately reporting any sightings of dead whales or distressed live animals they discover. So far, scientists have been able to reach just one of the 30 whale carcasses. \"Alaska has an awful lot of coastline and much of it is difficult to reach,\" NOAA adviser Dr. Bree Witteveen told CBC. \" We can't get to those carcasses more often than not .\" The broadcaster said an additional six dead whales have turned up along the coast of British Columbia, and Canadian authorities are working closely with NOAA. One theory is that a toxic algae bloom , created by warmer-than-usual waters off the West Coast, could be playing a role. Advertisement \u201cThat always concerns us because that means there\u2019s probably a change in overall pathogen exposure , possibly harmful algal blooms and other factors,\u201d Rowles said in news conference on Thursday, according to Alaska Dispatch News. So far, one sample tested negative for a type of toxin produced by algae, but the carcass was so decomposed that it may not be reliable, the Dispatch News reported. The agency also said in an online FAQ that it's \"highly unlikely\" that radiation from Fukushima is playing a role, but that further testing is under way. Advertisement NOAA said it may take months or years before scientists know for sure what's causing the deaths . It's the first unusual mortality event for whales ever in Alaska, and just the third of any kind in the state. The agency had previously declared such events for pinnipeds in 2011 and sea otters in 2006. The agency has released a map showing where the carcasses have been spotted, with a number of them concentrated in the Kodiak area. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Depressing New Study Shows Know-It-Alls Get Better Grades Just when you thought they couldn't be any more annoying. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Oct 8, 2015, 12:27 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Ugh. It turns out know-it-alls really may know it all. New research by scientists at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, shows the more arrogant students are about their intellectual abilities , the greater their academic success. \"Those who think that their ideas are better than those around them were in fact the highest performers in terms of individual projects, such as exams,\" Ben Meagher, the study's lead author who is now a visiting professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, told The Huffington Post in an email. The finding came as a big surprise to Meagher and his colleagues. They had predicted that having a realistic rather than inflated sense of one's smarts would be associated with better grades, but that just wasn't the case. Advertisement For the study, researchers followed 103 undergraduate psychology students as they worked in groups for an entire semester. At the end of the term, each group member evaluated everyone on their team, including themselves. They rated each other on assertiveness, intelligence, openness and other traits. Advertisement The students who were rated as dominant, extroverted, wanting of attention, inflexible and inconsiderate by other group members were also rated as intellectually arrogant. The researchers found those students were the most likely to have received high marks at the end of the semester. But while intellectual arrogance may be associated with better grades, that doesn't mean intellectually arrogant students get high grades because of their big heads. Advertisement \"I suspect that it is more likely that students who tend to get better grades are aware of that fact, and so they (perhaps rightly) believe that their ideas are the best,\" Meagher said in the email. What's more, intellectual arrogance just might backfire -- at least when students work in a group. \"People that are viewed as humble are most positively evaluated [by their team members],\" Meagher said. So stay humble, friends. Arrogance can only get you so far. This study was published in the October issue of Journal of Research in Personality . What does your personality say about you?

High-Speed Hyperloop Hits 116 mph In 1.1 Seconds During First Public Test System could one day transport people at speeds of more than 700 mph. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost May 11, 2016, 11:52 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Is this the future of travel? Hyperloop One held the first public demonstration of its propulsion system on Wednesday, with a unmanned sled hitting 116 mph in just 1.1 seconds on a short stretch of track outside of Las Vegas. Eventually, the company hopes the system will hit speeds of more than 700 mph. Advertisement According to The Wall Street Journal, the hyperloop system doesn't have brakes yet , so after the short test, the sled drove into a pool of sand: Hyperloop One is one of several companies working on transportation technology known as hyperloop, which will feature pods or cars racing through tubes in near-vacuum conditions with little to no air resistance to maximize efficiency and increase speed. Advertisement Tesla cofounder Elon Musk released a white paper in 2013 in support of the technology. In an interview with All Things D, he called hyperloop \" a cross between a Concorde, a railgun and an air hockey table .\" Earlier this week, the company announced that it had raised $80 million in financing and was changing its name from Hyperloop Technologies to Hyperloop One. The company is hoping its system will be operational within five years, transporting passengers between Los Angeles and San Francisco in just 30 minutes , the BBC reported. \u201cWhen you think of hyperloop, you think maybe this is gonna happen years from now,\" CEO Rob Lloyd said in a video released by the company. \"It\u2019s gonna happen much quicker than anyone imagines -- and when it does, the world will never be the same .\" Advertisement Hyperloop One also said there will be more tests in the near future, and promised what it called a \" Kitty Hawk moment \" later this year.

Now We Know Why Britain's 'Oldest Human Brain' Looked Pristine Even After Thousands Of Years Mystery Of 'Britain's Oldest Brain' Finally Solved By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 7, 2015, 10:15 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists got a huge surprise in 2009 when they found a well-preserved human brain inside a 2,600-year-old skull dug up at an archaeological site in Heslington, England. They simply couldn't fathom how a mass of soft tissue could be preserved for thousands of years. But now they know the answer--and it's all about mud. That's right. Researchers at the York Archaeological Trust have determined that the wet, clay-rich soil in which the skull was found provided a sealed, oxygen-free environment that protected the brain against bacterial decomposition. Advertisement (Story continues below image.) Rachel Cubitt, of the York Archaeological Trust, uses an endoscope to examine the brain. \"I peered though the hole at the base of the skull to investigate and to my surprise saw a quantity of bright yellow spongy material ,\" Rachel Cubitt, collection projects officer at the Trust and the person who gave the brain a cleaning, said in a written statement. \"It was unlike anything I had seen before.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Amazing Slo-Mo Video Of Baby Praying Mantis Jumping Gives Scientists Big Surprise Slo-Mo Mantis Gives Scientists A Major Surprise By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Mar 6, 2015, 08:39 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Praying mantises are pretty amazing jumpers--and you don't have to take that on faith. Just have a look at this amazing new video (above) of a baby mantis making a heroic Hail Mary hop and nailing a very tricky landing. The video is a slowed-down look at a leap that in real life takes only 80 milliseconds--or briefer than the blink of an eye . It shows that, unlike fleas and grasshoppers and other jumping insects, mantises don't spin uncontrollably while airborne. Advertisement For the scientists who captured the video as part of a new study published March 5, 2015 in the journal Current Biology, that came as a big surprise. \u201cWe had assumed spin was bad, but we were wrong-- juvenile mantises deliberately create spin and harness it in mid-air to rotate their bodies to land on a target,\u201d Malcolm Burrows, a professor in the department of zoology at Cambridge University in England and the lead author of the study, said in a written statement. \u201cAs far as we can tell, these insects are controlling every step of the jump.\" If you think the bug's aerial feat is as inconsequential as the insect itself, think again. Another of the scientists involved in the study, Bristol University's Dr. Gregory Sutton, seems convinced that what works for mantises might also work for certain robots. Advertisement \u201cFor small robots, flying is energetically expensive, and walking is slow,\" Sutton said in the statement. \"Jumping makes sense--but controlling the spin in jumping robots is an almost intractable problem. The juvenile mantis is a natural example of a mechanical set-up that could solve this.\u201d As Burrows told Newsweek, \u201cMaybe you could put some stabilizers on a robot\u2019s body [so it can] move like the mantis does.\u201d Sounds like the answer to a roboticist's prayer. | Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement Close From Our Partner What's Hot More In Science NEWS POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE VOICES HUFFPOST PERSONAL SHOPPING NEWSLETTERS About Us Advertise Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers User Agreement Comment Policy DMCA Policy HuffPost Press Room Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy Consent Preferences Privacy Settings Part of HuffPost Science. \u00a92025 BuzzFeed, Inc.

Hawaii Could Be Devastated By A Tsunami Within 50 Years Living in the middle of the Pacific has its downfalls. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost May 13, 2016, 11:16 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT HONOLULU -- On the south side of the Hawaiian island of Kauai lies Makauwahi, a massive cave and sinkhole where scientists have uncovered evidence of an enormous tsunami that struck Hawaii about 500 years ago. Triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the coast of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, the tsunami likely brought waves up to 30 feet -- enough to devastate Hawaii's coastal populations, infrastructure and economy today. A new study says there's a chance it will happen again within 50 years. Aero17 via Getty Images Advertisement The study , published Friday in the Journal of Geophysical Research , involved a team of researchers at The University of Hawaii at Manoa who analyzed fault length and plate-convergence rates to estimate the likelihood of a mega-earthquake (magnitude 9 or greater) in the Aleutian Islands. The findings suggest there is between a 6 percent and 12 percent chance of a mega-earthquake striking the Aleutians and causing a tsunami in Hawaii in the next 50 years. If and when it happens, it could cause some $40 billion in damage and affect 400,000 residents and tourists. Lead author Rhett Butler , a geophysicist at the UH School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, said in a statement that he and his team devised their model precisely because Hawaii has no recorded history of mega-tsunamis . Advertisement \u201cNecessity is the mother of invention,\u201d Butler said. The researchers validated their model by using data from the five largest tsunamis since 1900 -- Kamchatka, 1952; Chile, 1960; Alaska, 1964; Sumatra-Andaman, 2004; and Tohoku, 2011-- as well as evidence found in geological samples, including some from the Makauwahi sinkhole. The team said it hopes the findings will help Hawaii officials prioritize the potential of a tsunami threat with other risks. It is also considering ways to estimate the threat of smaller-magnitude earthquakes in the Pacific.

Hurt (SSC)/flickr, CC BY-SA Elizabeth Tasker , Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) On Monday June 19, NASA held a media briefing to announce the completed catalogue of exoplanets from the Kepler Mission. The catalogue lists 4,034 exoplanet discoveries, including 219 new finds. Ten of these new worlds are close in size to the Earth and reside within their star\u2019s habitable zone , a location that would permit liquid water on the surface of an Earth-like world. Advertisement These ten join roughly 40 other worlds found by Kepler as possible candidates for Earth\u2019s twin. But is the prospect of another Earth really the Kepler legacy? Teeming with planets While planets had been discovered around other stars since the early 1990s, the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope in 2009 resulted in them being found in droves . As the numbers increased from tens to thousands of exoplanets, astronomers were able to identify types of planets and speculate on their frequency through our Galaxy; Kepler had given us the ability to do statistics. Our Solar System suggests there are just two flavours of planet: terrestrial worlds like the Earth with rocky surfaces and thin atmospheres, and gas giants like Jupiter, whose solid cores are buried beneath thousands of kilometres of enveloping gases. Advertisement This neat, bimodal picture is taken to pieces in the Kepler Mission catalogue. The catalogue contents reveal gas giants that orbit their star closer than Mercury, other worlds so hot their surface must be molten magma and planets around binary stars like Luke Skywalker\u2019s fictional home world of Tatooine in the film franchise Star Wars. But perhaps the most mysterious entries are the so-called super Earths. How super, really? Over two-thirds of the planets in the Kepler Mission Catalogue have radii of between 1.1 and four Earths, placing them between Earth and Neptune in size. These super Earths are the most common planet discovered, yet our own Solar System has no analogue to tell us what such worlds might be like. Are they terrestrial planets with rocky surfaces or mini gas giants with crushing atmospheric pressures? As interest has mounted in the prospect of finding a habitable planet, a key question is whether any of these worlds have a solid surface. Advertisement Our Solar System has only cold gas and ice giants and rocky terrestrial planets, but the Kepler Mission revealed many other planet types. NASA/Ames Research Center/Natalie Batalha/Wendy Stenzel, Author provided At the media briefing, NASA revealed that the Kepler Mission catalogue had produced a clue. A recent journal paper had spotted a split in the distribution of super-Earth planet sizes. While planets with radii of around 1.3 Earths and 2.4 Earths are equally common, planets with sizes between 1.5 and two Earth radii are much harder to find. The astronomers speculate that this is the division between giant rocky planets and gaseous mini-Neptunes. Advertisement Although this strong divide in the super-Earth population has not previously been observed, its location agrees with the small number of planets we have bulk density measurements for. These density values suggest that planets larger than about 1.6 Earth radii have thick, Neptune-like atmospheres. But while the Kepler Space Telescope can give us both sizes and locations for exoplanets, it cannot tell us anything about their past or present surface environment. We need theories to explain the different planet types identified within the catalogue. Explaining super Earths One possibility for the split in the super-Earth population is that the rocky planets have had their atmospheres stripped by radiation pouring from a star. Alternatively, the rocky worlds may have formed later from the gas-rich planet-forming disc that dispersed before the planets could accrue a thick atmosphere. Advertisement We meet a similar problem for the 50 planets found within the habitable zone. Knowing only their size and location is not enough to determine if their surfaces are similar to the Earth. The Kepler Mission data helped reveal a split in the super-Earth planet population, separating large rocky planets from small gas giants (B. J. Fulton). NASA/Ames/Caltech/University of Hawaii, Author provided A difference in geology could create a very different atmosphere to our own, or the inability to create protective magnetic fields to shield the planet from sterilising stellar flares. The temperature may even be perfect for liquid water, but the planet entirely dry. Advertisement Without being able to probe surfaces, the Kepler telescope was never designed to find a true Earth twin. Rather, the mission catalogue tells us that planets can form around nearly every star and exist in a huge variety of conditions. The Kepler Mission spanned four years (2009 to 2013), exploring a patch of sky in the Cygnus constellation. In May 2013, the second of the telescope\u2019s four gyroscope-like reaction wheels failed and it was unable to keep a stable position. But the telescope continues to search the sky near the ecliptic plane (where the zodiac constellations lie), using radiation pressure from the Sun for positioning. This has become the K2 mission and has already found over 500 planets. Advertisement Future missions such as TESS and JWST (planned launch in 2018) and Ariel (planned launch in 2026) will add to this number, and begin to probe the environment of these worlds. The Kepler Mission catalogue told us where to look, now we can begin to uncover what alien worlds are truly like. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Pluto Has Blue Skies And Red Ice, NASA Says The distant dwarf planet just keeps surprising us. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post and Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Oct 8, 2015, 03:19 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA's New Horizons mission keeps revealing new surprises about Pluto. The latest: The far-flung dwarf planet has blue skies and small patches of water ice on its surface. \"Who would have expected a blue sky in the Kuiper Belt ?\" Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator, said in a written statement, referring to the belt of small bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. \"It's gorgeous.\" On Earth, blue skies are the result of the scattering of sunlight by gas molecules in the atmosphere. Things are a bit different on Pluto. There, sunlight is scattered not by molecules but by a haze of soot-like particles called tholins , which are created as a result of chemical reactions involving methane and nitrogen high above Pluto. Another difference is that while Earth's sky looks blue to us most of the time, that doesn't seem to be the case on Pluto. If you stood on Pluto and looked straight up , the sky would actually appear black, the BBC reported. Advertisement \"The haze is pretty thin, so you'd mostly see the color of the haze as blue sunrises and sunsets,\" New Horizons team member Carly Howett told the BBC. (Story continues below photos.) Pluto's haze layer looks blue in this picture taken by the New Horizons spacecraft. The high-altitude haze is thought to be similar to that seen at Saturn's moon Titan. The source of both hazes likely involves sunlight-initiated chemical reactions of nitrogen and methane, leading to soot-like particles (tholins) that grow as they settle toward the surface. This image was generated by software that combines information from blue, red and near-infrared images to replicate the color a human eye would perceive as closely as possible. NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI Regions with exposed water ice are highlighted in blue in this composite image from the New Horizons spacecraft. It combines visible imagery with infrared spectroscopy. The strongest signatures of water ice occur along Virgil Fossa, just west of Elliot crater on the left side of the inset image, and also in Viking Terra near the top of the frame. A major outcrop also occurs in Bar\u00e9 Montes towards the right of the image, along with numerous smaller outcrops, mostly associated with impact craters and valleys between mountains. The scene is approximately 280 miles (450 kilometers) across. Note that all surface feature names are informal. NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI Advertisement The water ice was detected in several places on Pluto's surface, including impact craters and valleys. And if you're envisioning patches of whitish-bluish stuff like the ice seen in chilly spots on Earth, think again. Pluto's water ice is a crimson color--perhaps as a result of ice-covered tholins that fall to the surface. \"I'm surprised that this water ice is so red,\" Silvia Protopapa, a New Horizons science team member from the University of Maryland, College Park, said in the statement. \"We don't yet understand the relationship between water ice and the reddish tholin colorants on Pluto's surface.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Confirm That Some Spiders Can Pretty Much BASE Jump Why, Mother Nature? Why? By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 21, 2015, 01:27 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Your worst nightmare has come true: Spiders are falling from the sky. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Louisville and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute have found that some spiders in the tropical/subtropical genus Selenops leap from treetops and steer through the air to land on neighboring tree trunks -- much like a BASE jumper steering his or her way down a cliff. Selenops is the first genus of spider found to display this behavior, which is evidently does in order to find food and avoid predators. Some insects, like canopy ants , have also been observed doing this. Advertisement For their research, the scientists collected 59 Selenops spiders from tree trunks in Peru and Panama. Then the researchers dropped the spiders one by one -- always from a height of between 65 and 80 feet, and always within about five feet of a nearby tree trunk -- and observed what happened. Can you spot the Selenops banksi hiding on this tree trunk in Panama? (Scale bar is 1 cm.) Credit: Journal of the Royal Society An overwhelming majority of these spiders -- 55 out of 59, or about 93 percent -- made what the researchers call a \"direct\" descent toward the tree trunk, meaning they glided toward the trunk in what appeared to be a controlled, deliberate manner and landed successfully on it. Advertisement What's interesting, according to the findings, is that these spiders \"never attached draglines to the specimen vial during the initial drop, nor was silk ever seen during descent.\" In other words, the spiders were in free fall -- but could still control the direction of their descent, apparently by moving and twitching their legs in midair. (The researchers note that \"each spider was tested only once, as it was not possible to recover individuals post-descent\" -- which, yeah, if someone dropped us from 65 feet off the ground, we wouldn't stick around to let them do it a second time, either.) If it's any comfort, the researchers note that \"other arachnid lineages,\" like scorpions and daddy longlegs, do not exhibit the same controlled gliding behavior, meaning you don't have to worry about scorpions paratrooping through your window at night. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
