Just One Night Of Bad Sleep Can Alter Your Genes It's been shown sleep deprivation can affect your genes. A new study suggests just how little it takes. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 22, 2015, 12:46 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have long known that skimping on sleep can screw with our health and biological clock , which helps our bodies adapt to the daily cycle of day and night. Now, a new small study suggests that all it takes is one night of sleep loss to alter our biological clock genes -- and this impact may hold clues to the complex link between sleep and certain diseases. After all, lack of sleep has been linked to negative effects on our metabolism and even an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. \"[O]ur current results indicate that changes of our clock genes may be linked to such negative effects caused by sleep loss,\" Dr. Jonathan Cedernaes, the study's lead author and a sleep researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden, said in a written statement. Advertisement For the study, 15 healthy men were asked to spend two nights in a lab, during which they slept for around 8 hours one night but were kept awake another night. The environmental factors, lighting, food intake and activity levels remained the same. Then, each morning after the men woke up, the researchers collected blood and tissue samples from the men. Molecular analyses of the tissue samples revealed that the regulation and activity of clock genes was altered after that one night of sleep loss. In addition, the expression of the men's genes -- or the process by which the information encoded in a gene is used -- was altered. Cedernaes said he was surprised to discover that the genes could be altered so quickly. But it's not clear, researchers noted, whether these gene alterations could have a longer-lasting effect.\"It could be that these changes are reset after one or several nights of good sleep,\" Cedernaes said in the statement. On the other hand, \"this could mean that at least some types of sleep loss or extended wakefulness, as in shift work, could lead to changes in the genome of your tissues that can affect your metabolism for longer periods.\" Advertisement Previous studies have shown that sleep deprivation can mess with your genes. A 2013 study from researchers at the University of Surrey in England showed that just one week of insufficient sleep (fewer than six hours of sleep a night) can change more than 700 genes . That's even more reason to prioritize regular shuteye. The new study was published online in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism on July 13.

Ancient Supernova Explosion At The Center Of Our Galaxy Created Enough Dust To Make 7,000 Earths Astronomers Solve Long-Standing Cosmic Mystery By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 22, 2015, 09:42 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have long known that \" we are made of star stuff \" -- or, in other words, cosmic dust. But where all that dust came from, and how it survived, has been a bit of a mystery. Previous research held that supernovas --explosions of stars in their death throes--spewed out massive amounts of dust into the early universe. However, astronomers didn't know if that dust was able to withstand shockwaves from the explosion to serve as fodder for planets and stars to form. Now, for the first time, an international team of astronomers has directly observed a cloud of cosmic dust that did survive in the turbulent environment of a supernova remnant , providing support for the theory that supernovas produced the vast amount of cosmic dust in the early universe. Advertisement \"Our observations reveal a particular cloud produced by a supernova explosion 10,000 years ago contains enough dust to make 7,000 Earths ,\" lead researcher Dr. Ryan Lau, a postdoctoral associate for astronomy at Cornell, said in a written statement. (Story continues below image.) Peering into the center of the Milky Way galaxy, in this false color image, contour lines reveal the dusty area of Sagittarius A East - an ancient supernova remnant. Lau and his colleagues found the elusive dust using NASA's airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy , which consists of a reflecting telescope aboard a modified Boeing 747 jumbo jet. Advertisement \"We were on a flying observatory traveling at 600 mph (965 km/h) at an altitude of 45,000 feet (13,715 meters) to take images of a ... supernova remnant located 27,000 light-years away from us at the center of our galaxy,\" Lau told Space.com. \"One of the most surprising things is that we were not expecting to see this at all.\" Supernova remnant dust detected by SOFIA (yellow) survives away from the hottest X-ray gas (purple).

According to Lau, his team was actually looking at \"two brighter features\" around Sagittarius A East, a supernova remnant at the heart of the Milky Way, when they detected the dust. Advertisement By taking detailed infrared images of the dust cloud, the researchers were able to estimate that about 7 to 20 percent of the dust survived the explosion's shockwaves. The researchers say this may have occurred due to dense gas surrounding that helped the dust cool, Space.com reported. A paper describing the research was published online on March 19 in Science.

People Across The U.S. Watch 'Surreal' Solar Eclipse A scientist calls it \u201cthe most spectacular thing that anybody has ever seen.\" By Lydia O'Connor Senior Reporter, HuffPost and Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 21, 2017, 01:53 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING DENVER \u2015 People across North America finally got to view the highly anticipated total solar eclipse on Monday. The event, described by one scientist as \u201cthe most spectacular thing that anybody has ever seen,\u201d began crossing 14 states on a path from Oregon to South Carolina on Monday morning. Along that \u201cpath of totality,\u201d viewers have been able to view the moon completely covering the sun. Advertisement Observers outside the path of totality have been able to see a partial solar eclipse, protecting their eyes with highly sought-after special glasses . In the Sloan\u2019s Lake neighborhood of Denver, people gathered under a cloudless blue sky to watch the moon slowly obstruct the sun, eventually blocking just above 92 percent of it. Jordan Van Wyck, 30, called the spectacle \u201csurreal.\u201d He and his friends wondered what solar eclipses might look like on a planet with multiple moons. Advertisement Jordan Van Wyck, 30, at center, described the spectacle in Denver as \"surreal.\" Ryan Genoble/HuffPost This is the first total eclipse viewable from the lower 48 states since February 1979 . It will be the first total solar eclipse in 99 years to sweep from coast to coast. Viewing events were held across the country, including at the White House where President Donald Trump stood on the Truman Balcony. \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d a voice from the crowd bellowed as Trump briefly looked up at the partial eclipse without protective glasses.

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters In Washington, D.C., the moon covered about 81 percent of the sun in the afternoon. During totality \u2015 the few minutes when the moon completely obscures the sun \u2015 the sky fades to black.

Here's Why Scientists Are Giving Tiny Glasses To Insects Have you ever seen a praying mantis look so chic? By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 9, 2016, 07:01 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Researchers are equipping praying mantises with stylish 3D shades -- and not just for fun. The tiny glasses were used in a study published in the journal Scientific Reports on Thursday to analyze 3D vision in mantises, and to explore how they use their vision to hunt. Better understanding how the insects use 3D vision may help scientists develop new ideas about how to use 3D in technology, Dr. Jenny Read, professor of vision science at Newcastle University in England and the study's leader, said in a statement. Advertisement \u201cDespite their minute brains, mantises are sophisticated visual hunters which can capture prey with terrifying efficiency. We can learn a lot by studying how they perceive the world,\" she said. \u201cBetter understanding of their simpler processing systems helps us understand how 3D vision evolved, and could lead to possible new algorithms for 3D depth perception in computers.\" The glasses were attached to the mantises with beeswax, and they allowed the researchers to show the insects short movies of simulated bugs moving around on the screen, which the mantises viewed as prey. It turned out that when the video was shown in 2D, the mantises didn\u2019t react, but when it was shown in 3D, the mantises attacked , Discovery News reported. (See the video above.) Advertisement \"Well, 3D vision has loads of applications , like robot navigation,\" Dr. Ghaith Tarawneh, a research associate at the university and a co-author of the study, told The Christian Science Monitor. \"Robots rely on getting information from the environments. You want the robot to understand somehow its environment and perhaps move towards particular goals and it needs some sort of understanding of the environment based on visual input.\" Check out the mantises sporting their glasses below.

Here's One Reason To Be Optimistic About The Field Of Cancer Research Scientists have seen small-scale successes with targeted therapeutics, and that could mean something big in the long run. By Rahel Gebreyes Editor, HuffPost Video Jun 8, 2016, 12:03 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Simply comprehending that not every cancer behaves the same way has significantly changed how scientists conceptualize the disease -- and has helped them make some promising breakthroughs in related research. Genomics, which is the study of genes and their interrelationships, has led researchers to a \"major conceptual and technical change in cancer therapeutics,\" said Edison Liu, the president and CEO of nonprofit biomedical research organization Jackson Laboratory . Understanding the genetics of a patient and their cancer can help doctors determine how to best tackle a mutation, Liu explains in the latest episode of The Huffington Post's \" Talk Nerdy to Me \" series. Advertisement \"We used to treat lung cancers all the same,\" he said. \"Then we found out the squamous carcinomas and the adenocarcinomas and small-cell carcinomas actually behave differently and respond to different kinds of therapy.\" Targeted therapy differs from standard chemotherapy in that it is designed to attack specific molecular targets. Chemotherapy, on the other hand, destroys all rapidly dividing normal and cancerous cells. \"What targeted therapeutic does is [it] actually uses the variances of the different cancers to really focus and attack it in the most precise way to reduce collateral damage,\" Liu added. Advertisement Liu said he is so far most excited about emerging immunotherapeutics , which use a patient's own immune system to fight cancer. Cancer immunotherapy doesn't work every time, but Liu said scientists have seen dramatic results among the few people who have responded well to it. With each success, researchers can slowly chip away at the number of untreatable cancers, he added. \"What we're really accruing is fantastic treatments for small segments of cancers,\" Liu said. \"You chip away 5 percent, [another] 5 percent, [and another] 5 percent, and pretty soon you've got a lot of cancers that are being well treated or even cured.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Nearsightedness Is Reaching Epidemic Proportions, And Scientists Now Think They Know Why The Real Reason So Many People Are Going Nearsighted By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 21, 2015, 10:05 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Woman's Face Behind Eye Exam Machine The southern city of Guangzhou has long held the largest eye hospital in China. But about five years ago, it became clear that the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center needed to expand. More and more children were arriving with the blurry distance vision caused by myopia, and with so many needing eye tests and glasses, the hospital was bursting at the seams. So the centre began adding new testing rooms \u2014 and to make space, it relocated some of its doctors and researchers to a local shopping mall. Now during the summer and winter school holidays, when most diagnoses are made, \u201cthousands and thousands of children\u201d pour in every day, says ophthalmologist Nathan Congdon, who was one of those uprooted. \u201cYou literally can't walk through the halls because of all the children.\u201d Advertisement Read more on Nature News Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

How Increasing Drought Threatens Most U.S. Forests And Households It's not just a West Coast problem. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 23, 2016, 03:39 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Phillippe Diederich via Getty Images It turns out that California is not alone in its five-year struggle against the devastating effects of drought. A new paper, published this week in the peer-reviewed journal Global Change Biology , shows that increasing drought not only affects Western forests, but forests and cities nationwide. Advertisement The drought's effects include a change in the biodiversity and number of plants and animals that live in forests and the deaths of entire communities of trees , said James Clark, professor of global environmental change and statistical science at Duke University and lead author of the paper. \"Essentially, all goods and services that we value from forests depend on climate, including wood and fiber products, wildlife, ample supply of clean water and recreation,\" Clark said. \"Droughts have not only direct effects on reduced forest productivity, but also large effects through interactions with wildfire and insect outbreaks.\" Additionally, 60 million Americans rely on drinking water that comes from 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands -- these forests also support 200,000 jobs and contribute more than $13 billion to local economies every year, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement . Advertisement \u201cOur forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened.\"\u201d - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack The paper, authored by scientists from 14 different research institutions, assessed previous data and studies on the consequences of drought. The scientists used those studies to gauge how increasing drought affected the continental U.S. in the last 20 years. Clark noted, however, that it will be difficult to anticipate how much forests will change across the country in the next 20 to 40 years. The researchers concluded that droughts are likely to become more severe, frequent and prolonged across much of the U.S. due to varied rainfall. They also found that climate change is happening too quickly for tree populations to respond , according to the National Science Foundation. Advertisement This will affect U.S. households, even in urban areas, Clark said. \"Droughts are already having a big impact on recreation, landscaping and individual water use,\" he said. For instance, drought-prone cities may have to adopt more landscaping techniques that reduce or eliminate the need for water. Our individual gardening practices will have to shift to plants that can tolerate drought, Clark said -- yet temperatures will also rise nationwide if there are fewer trees. \"Forested parks cool cities by transpiring water, just like you cool yourself by sweating. When you enter a city park, the temperature can decrease by as much as 5 degrees due to this vaporization of water,\" he explained. \"The problem is that trees may require too much water as drought becomes more frequent. As trees are replaced, there can be more heating, because drought-adapted plants use less water, reducing the cooling effect.\" Advertisement The new paper was part of a larger report conducted and released by the U.S. Forest Service this month to help understand how to manage the forests and grasslands most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. \"Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,\" Vilsack said in the statement. \"This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Game Can Make People Less Prejudiced. Here's How. It only works if you don't know it's trying to work. By Lila Shapiro Senior Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post Oct 27, 2015, 02:51 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT New research suggests that certain games could help reduce gender bias, such as the idea that women aren't suited for careers in science and math. Tom Werner via Getty Images Can you name a female physicist? It turns out just trying to do so may make you less likely to believe women aren\u2019t good at science or math. OK, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that. But new research this week suggests that a game that prompts players to name real or fictional characters who fit certain combinations of attributes can actually reduce prejudice in those who play it. For years, researchers have explored the question of whether video games make people more violent, aggressive and prejudiced . But this new study , published in Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace, adds to a growing body of work that shows that some games can actually change views and behaviors of players for the better. Advertisement For the study, researchers from Dartmouth University asked hundreds of middle school and high school students to play two games. One is Buffalo: The Name-Dropping Game , in which players are prompted to name female physicists (along with English wizards, \" mischievous professors \" and hundreds of other random combinations). The other is Awkward Moment , in which players contemplate what to do when, say, they spot a store in the mall selling T-shirts for girls that say \u201cMath is hard!\u201d (Options include sending out \u201ca distress signal,\u201d saying \u201cP.U. That stinks!\u201d and \u201cBe like Marie Curie and win Nobel Prizes.\") After the kids played Awkward Moment, researchers presented players with a set of photographs of men and women and told them they needed help trying to decide what role each character should play in a new, unreleased game. Those who played Awkward Moment were a third more likely to suggest that female characters should be scientists than those who played a version of the game without any \u201cawkward moments\u201d related to gender bias. Those who played Buffalo, meanwhile, were more concerned about their own potential biases and showed less prejudice toward others than did the control group that didn\u2019t play the game but answered the follow-up questionnaires. The trick to all of this is both simple and revealing of human nature. In order for people to change their prejudices after playing a game, they have to remain in the dark about the fact that the game is intended to change them. Both Buffalo and Awkward Moment are designed with this in mind. Advertisement \u201c There has to at least be the illusion of agency or the sense that your shift in mindset or perspective is at least partly volitional,\u201d Geoff Kaufman, now an assistant professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and a co-author of the paper, explained to The Huffington Post. \u201cThat builds on decades of research in psychology, how any time you feel like there is an agent that is trying to persuade you, the more you resist it and the less effective it tends to be.\u201d So could a quick game of Awkward Moment change the attitudes of someone like William Bader , the imperial wizard of the Trinity White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, who told a reporter at a rally this summer that \u201cWhite revolution is the only solution\u201d? Kaufman and his co-author, Mary Flanagan, didn\u2019t examine how participants\u2019 pre-existing levels of prejudice might have influenced their reactions to the games. But Kaufman was intrigued by the possibilities. Advertisement Flanagan designed the games for the study. She's a professor in digital humanities at Dartmouth and the founder of Tiltfactor , a company that designs games for \"social change.\" She and Kaufman are considering a digital version of the game that could assess baseline attitudes and then adapt, depending on how players respond. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Find 4-Legged Snake Fossil \"It really is a fantastic, very very rare and extremely important fossil for evolutionary studies.\" By Lydia O'Connor Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 23, 2015, 08:13 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The discovery of what's thought to be the first four-legged snake fossil is giving scientists a closer look at how the slithery creatures evolved from lizards. The unusual remains, 20 centimeters long with tiny 1-centimeter legs, were reported by researchers at England's University of Portsmouth in the journal Science on Thursday, and are estimated to be about 110 million years old. Advertisement \"It really is a fantastic, very very rare and extremely important fossil for evolutionary studies,\" the study's lead scientist, Dave Martill, said in a video released by the university. Martill said his team hopes the fossil, the oldest definitive snake discovery, will finally reveal the story of how some lizards lost their legs. \u201cIt is generally accepted that snakes evolved from lizards at some point in the distant past,\" Martill said in a press release. \"What scientists don\u2019t know yet is when they evolved, why they evolved, and what type of lizard they evolved from. This fossil answers some very important questions, for example it now seems clear to us that snakes evolved from burrowing lizards, not from marine lizards.\u201d Advertisement Martill said the fossil is considered a snake, not a lizard, because of its elongated body; a skull, jaw, vertebrae and impression of scales resembling a snake's; and the bony remains of its last meal fitting the diet of a snake. The fossil was excavated in Brazil decades ago and had been sitting untouched in a private collection until Martill came across it and began studying it, the journal Nature reported. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The tools were found alongside the remains of butchered animals, such as an elephant rib bone bearing cut marks (see photo above), at a dig site in Revadimin, Israel in 2004. Advertisement Now, researchers who recently analyzed the finds have discovered the tools are covered in animal fat, and are calling them the first direct evidence of the use of stone tools by ancient human ancestors for animal butchery. \"Archaeologists have until now only been able to suggest scenarios about the use and function of such tools. We don't have a time machine,\" Prof. Ran Barkai, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University's Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Cultures and one of the researchers, said in a written statement. \"It makes sense that these tools would be used to break down carcasses, but until evidence was uncovered to prove this, it remained just a theory.\" After examining the wear on the surface of the tools, and conducting experiments with replicas modeled after them, the researchers believe one of the tools was a hand axe, a sort of prehistoric \"Swiss army knife\" that could cut and break down bone and tissue. Advertisement Another tool, called a scraper, was likely used to separate animal fat and fur from muscle. The hand axe, bearing signs of use (small red dots) and residue of animal fat (blue dots). The ancient discovery helps shed new light on \"a major breakthrough in human evolution,\" Barkai said in the statement. How so? As prehistoric hominins such as Homo erectus developed bigger brains , they required a higher caloric intake, which resulted in a shift from a plant-based diet to a meat-based one, Live Science reported. That required the development of more advanced technology that could extract fat and muscle from animal carcasses. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Some Fish Can Recognize Human Faces, Scientists Find Don\u2019t underestimate your pet fish. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jun 7, 2016, 12:23 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Zena Holloway via Getty Images Even tiny brains can accomplish complex tasks. Scientists have found that archerfish (a species of tropical fish) can learn to recognize human faces with striking accuracy. The finding, reported Tuesday in Scientific Reports , adds fish to list of animals, including birds, that are capable of pulling off the visual task. Recognizing faces requires such sophisticated cognitive function that it was previously attributed to only humans and other primates with large brains. \u201cBeing able to distinguish between a large number of human faces is a surprisingly difficult task, mainly due to the fact that all human faces share the same basic features,\u201d Cait Newport of Oxford University said in a statement . \u201cAll faces have two eyes above a nose and mouth, therefore to tell people apart we must be able to identify subtle differences in their features.\u201d Advertisement Newport told CNN that if the archerfish can tell humans apart, it's possible that other fish can, too . An archerfish spits a jet of water. A. & J. Visage via Getty Images The archerfish knock down insects hovering above them by spitting out a jet of water. This skill also means that the fish have a way of indicating an answer, making them particularly eligible for participating in a lab study. Advertisement In the experiments, Newport and her colleagues showed two human images to the fish and trained them to choose one of the images by giving them a treat each time they spit on the correct image. Next, the fish were presented with the face they\u2019d learned and dozens of new faces. In about 80 percent of the trials, the fish selected the face they already knew. The fish were able to do this task even when the faces were fairly similar, as you can see in this video: Advertisement In humans, the brain has a specialized region used for recognizing human faces, known as the fusiform face area, or FFA. The simpler brain of the fish entirely lacks this region, Newport said. Nevertheless, the archerfish that the team studied were capable of choosing the familiar face from up to 44 new faces. \u201cThe fact that archerfish can learn this task suggests that complicated brains are not necessarily needed to recognize human faces,\u201d Newport said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Of course, we humans are still better than fish at facial recognition, thanks to our FFA. \u201cHumans may have special facial recognition brain structures so that they can process a large number of faces very quickly or under a wide range of viewing conditions,\u201d Newport said. Advertisement Picking a face out of a crowd doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a fish knows that person, but rather that it can detect and learn subtle differences in visual patterns. In fact, archerfish have already demonstrated great vision by being able to detect small prey against a visually complex background, the researchers said. Previous research has suggested that birds , and perhaps bees , are able to recognize human faces as well.

Oliver Sacks, Neurologist And Author, Dies At 82 \"I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return.\" By Melissa Jeltsen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Aug 30, 2015, 07:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Nancy R. Schiff via Getty Images Famed British neurologist and author Oliver Sacks died on Sunday at the age of 82, his assistant told The New York Times. The cause of death was cancer. In February, Sacks wrote an op-ed revealing that he was in the late stages of terminal cancer , after earlier melanoma in his eye spread to his liver. Advertisement \"It is up to me now to choose how to live out the months that remain to me,\" he wrote. \"I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and traveled and thought and written. I have had an intercourse with the world, the special intercourse of writers and readers.\" Sacks was a bestselling author who wrote a number of books, including Musicophilia , Awakenings and The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat . Born in London in 1933, Sacks grew up surrounded by a family of doctors. His mother was a surgeon and his father was a general practitioner. Advertisement He moved to New York in 1965 and became a consulting neurologist for Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx. There, he successfully treated a group of patients who were stuck in \"strange, frozen states, like human statues,\" who later became the subjects of Awakenings . \" Awakenings came from the most intense medical and human involvement I have even know, as I encountered, lived with, these patients in a Bronx hospital, some of whom had been transfixed, motionless, in a sort of trance, for decades,\" he said. The book inspired a movie of the same name starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams, which was nominated for three Oscars. Advertisement His last book, a memoir, was published in April. On The Move details Sack's childhood, his move to the United States, his sexuality, his professional achievements and his challenges. \"In this book he studies himself as he has studied others: compassionately, unblinkingly, intelligently, acceptingly and honestly,\" wrote Colin McGinn at The Wall Street Journal . \"There will not be another like him.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Are Seriously Worried About Whale Poop, And Here's Why The waste of large animals plays a vital role in keeping our planet fertile. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Oct 29, 2015, 11:22 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A decline in whale poop is disrupting the Earth's nutrient cycle, scientists say. Sue Flood/Getty Images Whale poop is pretty powerful stuff -- and no, not in terms of its stench. Scientists have long known that whale waste has the power to influence Earth's ecosystems . Vital nutrients found within the prodigious poop often end up traveling from the deep ocean to land, helping to fertilize our planet. Now, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday details exactly how this compelling cycle of nutrients works and how the cycle has slowed due to declines in populations of whales and other species. Advertisement \"In recent years, there have been a number of studies examining the transport of nutrients by large animals within oceans, across river systems, and over the land,\" Dr. Joe Roman, a biologist at the University of Vermont and a co-author of the study, said in an email. \"To my knowledge, this is the first study that looks at this pattern across the globe, and over time. We have a new understanding of the role of animals in enhancing and maintaining primary productivity, through movements within and across marine and terrestrial ecosystems.\" For the study, an international team of researchers developed math models based on historical data, heat diffusion and current animal populations to quantify the movement of nutrients -- including a key nutrient for plant fertilization called phosphorus -- across various ecosystems. The researchers then used the models to estimate how the nutrient cycle may have changed from prehistory to now. They took a close look at the influence that big animals known as megafauna had on the cycle. Advertisement \"We used the math model to predict the behavior of the extinct megafauna,\" Dr. Chris Doughty, a lecturer in ecosystem ecology at the University of Oxford and lead author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"We know little about these animals beyond their size, but with size we can predict food consumption and movement patterns. With this model, we can put all the original animals back into our world and see how nutrient cycling changed.\" An interlinked system of animals carries nutrients from ocean depths to deep inland -- through their poop, urine and, upon death, decomposing bodies. The arrows show the estimated amounts of phosphorus and other nutrients that were moved or diffused historically -- and how much these flows have been reduced today. Grey animals represent extinct or reduced species. Diagram from PNAS; designed by Renate Helmiss The researchers found that the nutrients released and transported by megafauna on land and in the oceans has dropped to just 6 percent of their levels tens of thousands of years ago, according to The Christian Science Monitor , before mass extinctions and population declines. Advertisement Examining marine mammals alone, the researchers found that the phosphorus released and transported by whales and others has dropped by 77 percent. In fact, whales -- which feed deep in the sea and come up to breathe at the surface -- once brought an estimated 750 million pounds of phosphorus up from the ocean each year. This number has now plunged to 165 million pounds. And the movement of phosphorus from the sea to land by seabirds and fish has gone down 96 percent, Live Science reported. Just check out the diagram above. \"There was once a natural system of recycling phosphorus between the oceans and land that no longer exists,\" Doughty said. \"This means, without these animals more phosphorus is lost more quickly to the bottom of the oceans. Easily accessible, mined phosphorus may run out in as little as 50 years.\" Advertisement A decline in phosphorus could negatively impact the growth of algae, which would disrupt both ocean and land ecosystems . The researchers pointed to hunting, overfishing and habitat loss as the causes of drastic declines in animal populations, which has resulted in a shortage of nutrient-rich poop. For instance, whale populations are estimated to have declined by up to 90 percent over the last three centuries due to whaling, the researchers said. While all animals are \"distribution pumps\" for key nutrients on a global scale, the megafauna are a critical part of the nutrient cycle, the researchers concluded. Advertisement \"I was surprised that large animals were disproportionately important for the transport of nutrients,\" Doughty said. \"Here we have shown that, in the past, animals constituted a global system of recycling phosphorus. By increasing populations of large, free-ranging animals we can partially replace this system of recycling and thus increase phosphorus concentrations on land.\" Roman agreed that the study holds clues to how restoring large animal populations could revive an ancient nutrient cycle, which would benefit wild ecosystems and us. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA Time-Lapse Video Shows A Year In The Life Of The Sun And it's full-on hypnotic. By Landess Kearns Senior Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Feb 22, 2016, 08:59 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Catching a clear view of the sun at sunrise or sunset is a treat, but watching a full year of the sun's activity in mere minutes? That's scientific and cinematic magic. A new time-lapse video (below), captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, shows the sun's entire 2015 -- and it's awesome. Advertisement The footage, released last week, shows the sun in extreme ultraviolet , a wavelength that human eyes normally cannot see. This allows us to view all of the activity that occurs in the sun's atmosphere, including solar filaments (arcs of plasma), coronal mass ejections (large explosions of magnetized plasma) and solar flares (flashes of light caused by the sudden release of energy). The sun's activity is so hypnotic and graceful that it's easy to forget how insanely hot solar material is. According to NASA, the activity shown in the video is around 600,000 Kelvin -- about 1 million degrees Fahrenheit. Advertisement NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory has been observing and recording the sun since 2010. Because it can capture the sun at 10 different wavelengths , the observatory helps scientists see all of the sun's activity and variations, ultimately helping them understand its impact on Earth and our planet's technological systems. One question that has long bothered scientists, for instance, is why the sun's atmosphere is 300 times hotter than its surface. Evidence from the observatory helped support the hypothesis that intermittent explosive bursts of heat , called nanoflares, are warming the solar atmosphere. As the side-by-side photo below shows, the sun's different wavelengths are equally mesmerizing. The red photo on the left shows the cooler plasma activity closer to the sun's surface, while the gold shows \"the finer strands of plasma looping above the surface,\" according to NASA. Advertisement This side-by-side rendering of the Sun at the same time in two different wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet light helps to visualize the differing features visible in each wavelength (Dec. 10-11, 2015). Most prominently, we can see much finer strands of plasma looping above the surface in the 171 Angstrom wavelength (gold) than in the 304 Angstrom wavelength (red), which captures cooler plasma closer to the Sun's surface. SDO observes the Sun in 10 different wavelengths with each one capturing somewhat different features at various temperatures and elevations above the Sun.

Possible Viking Find Could Rewrite North American History Archaeologist Sarah Parcak used satellite data to find the Canadian site. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 1, 2016, 07:10 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Archaeologist Sarah Parcak, pictured here with BBC presenter Dan Snow, says she may have unearthed a second Viking settlement in North America. BBC A team of archaeologists say they\u2019ve made a potentially \u201c seismic \u201d discovery in Canada that could \u201c rewrite the history of Vikings in the New World \u201d -- and they did it with the help of medieval sagas and the latest satellite technology. Medieval sagas , considered to be masterpieces of literature from the Middle Ages, capture the stories of the intrepid Vikings -- the master seafarers and warriors who, starting around the 8th century, ventured beyond their Scandinavian homelands to raid and trade in foreign lands. Advertisement According to these stories, many of them featuring \u201clarger-than-life heroes,\u201d the Vikings had made the first European voyage to North America -- at least 500 years before Christopher Columbus. But the question has long remained: Just how much fact was interwoven into these sagas, which Icelandic monks wrote in the 13th and 14th centuries? And if laced with truth, just how much of the New World did the Norse really explore? In the 1960s, archaeologists determined that a site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland in Canada -- L'Anse aux Meadows -- had been a Viking settlement, established about a millennium before. The discovery changed the history of European exploration in the New World and proved the sagas were not simply works of fiction. Advertisement L\u2019Anse aux Meadows, however, had merely been a temporary settlement, which the Norse abandoned after a few short years. Archaeologists have since been searching for clues of other Viking expeditions in North America; but in the past half-century, nothing concrete has been found. Until now. Thanks largely to the work of Sarah Parcak, a leading space archaeologist, evidence has been unearthed of a possible second Viking site in North America -- and it\u2019s located about 300 miles further south than L\u2019Anse aux Meadows. The site at Point Rosee, which Parcak pinpointed after analyzing satellite imagery, is located on the southwest coast of Newfoundland , The New York Times reports.

Advertisement Last summer, Parcak and a team of archaeologists conducted a test excavation at Point Rosee, and uncovered an \u201c iron-working hearth [and some cooked bog iron] partially surrounded by the remains of what appears to have been a turf wall ,\u201d The National Geographic reports. The team said they can\u2019t yet say for certain that the Vikings built the hearth, but the signs are encouraging. The turf wall is \u201cnothing like the shelters built by indigenous peoples who lived in Newfoundland at the time, nor by Basque fishermen and whalers who arrived in the 16th century,\" according to Nat Geo. And Douglas Bolender, an archaeologist who specializes in Viking settlements, said there \u201caren\u2019t any known cultures -- prehistoric or modern -- that would have been mining and roasting bog iron ore in Newfoundland other than the Norse.\u201d Advertisement Bolender told the BBC that the Point Rosee discovery \u201chas the potential to change history.\u201d \u201cThe sagas suggest a short period of activity and a very brief and failed colonization attempt. L\u2019Anse aux Meadows fits well with that story but is only one site. Point Rosee could reinforce that story or completely change it if the dating is different from L\u2019Anse aux Meadows. We could end up with a much longer period of Norse activity in the New World,\u201d he told Nat Geo. CGI reconstruction/animation graphic that depicts skeletons of dead Vikings in a longshp. BBC One of the reasons why the Vikings have been so hard to track down is because of the way they moved around. Advertisement \u201cThey travelled light and left nothing behind, No massive stone theatres for them. They voyaged in longships with a strong oak keel ... [and] sails spun from wool,\" historian Dan Snow writes for the BBC. \"Food was pickled herring, lamb smoked using reindeer droppings, fermented salmon. Almost everything on a Viking ship would get recycled or rot away.\u201d But, thanks to satellite imagery, Parcak believes that even the elusive Vikings can be found. In the case of Point Rosee, for instance, it had been irregularities in the soil -- \u201ca dark stain,\u201d according to the Times -- that initially piqued her interest. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Paralyzed Man Partially Regains Ability To Walk With Spinal Cord Implants David M'zee can walk over a half mile, hands free, with the implants turned on. By Andy McDonald Writer, HuffPost Nov 1, 2018, 03:27 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT David M\u2019zee can walk again thanks to a new spinal cord implant technology, according to findings published in the science journal \u201cNature.\u201d M\u2019zee lost the use of his legs due to a sporting accident but thanks to researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne , Switzerland, he can reportedly walk more than a half mile, hands free , with the implants turned on. Advertisement Two other patients were given similar implants and, combined with physical therapy, achieved similar results. But an important factor in this experiment is the implants aren\u2019t working the patients\u2019 legs for them. \u201cIt really works as an amplifier,\u201d lead neuroscientist Gr\u00e9goire Courtine told Nature. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re taking over control of the leg. The patients have to do it.\u201d The implants use targeted electrical stimulation to specific parts of the leg, recreating the way the brain interacts with the body. Advertisement \u201cIn our method, we implant an array of electrodes over the spinal cord which allows us to target individual muscle groups in the legs,\u201d said Lausanne University Hospital neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch. \u201cSelected configurations of electrodes are activating specific regions of the spinal cord, mimicking the signals that the brain would deliver to produce walking.\u201d The promising treatment shows that the brain and spinal cord can re-establish a connection and people can regain some control over parts of the body they had lost use of. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Find A Way To Combat Racial Bias Among Little Kids A new study suggests a technique to stop stereotyping before it's ingrained. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 29, 2015, 08:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: 4774344sean via Getty Images First, they found that infants as young as 3 months old show racial bias. Now they've found a way to shake up those early preferences -- and perhaps undermine more pernicious racial stereotypes as we grow up. Research from the University of Delaware had earlier shown that 3-month-olds have a visual preference for faces that match the racial group they see most in their daily lives. Advertisement A new study from the same team -- conducted as part of a decade-long international research project and published last month in the journal Developmental Science -- details an experiment that seemed to shift those unconscious biases seen in young children. Why do babies even have such biases? While infants can distinguish different races, they're less able to distinguish individual faces within a less-familiar racial group. So, for example, a white baby may be able to differentiate among -- and thus prefer -- individual white faces while struggling to differentiate among black or Asian faces. In other words, these very early leanings seem to be based on visual perception. Actual social biases don't come into play generally until children are around 3 or 4 years old. Advertisement The researchers hypothesized, however, that visual biases in infants might be related to the development of social biases in later childhood and adulthood -- and therefore disrupting early visual biases could help dislodge social biases, perhaps for the long term. \"We hit on the idea that if the perceptual and social biases are linked, we might be able to reduce the social bias by perceptual means,\" Dr. Paul Quinn, professor of psychology and brain science at the University of Delaware and the study's lead author, said in a press release . To test this hypothesis, researchers in Delaware and China created images of racially ambiguous faces by melding individual photos of African and Asian faces. Some of the faces had pleasant expressions, while others were more severe. Advertisement The researchers showed these photos to Chinese children, aged 4 to 6, and asked them to identify whether the faces were Asian or African. The kids tended to rate the happy-looking faces as Asian and the severe-looking faces as African. Next, the researchers showed the children five different photos of African faces and gave individual names to the faces. This was repeated for 15 to 30 minutes until the children were able to identify the faces by name. When the kids were shown the photos of racially ambiguous faces again, the bias they had displayed toward their own ethnic group was reduced significantly. Advertisement Why? The theory is that the children's perceptual bias for the more familiar-looking faces was undercut when they learned to see the unfamiliar faces as individuals, too. \"It may be that the individuation disrupts the process by which stereotypes are generalized across members of a [racial] category,\" Quinn told The Huffington Post via email. But he noted that further research is needed to explore how long these effects last and to determine whether the effects are the result of mere exposure. One question would be whether individualizing people must be done with language -- that is, by naming them. \"Would we get it with a unique musical tone for each face?\" Quinn said. \"Would we get it if we just asked the children to memorize the faces?\" Advertisement In the real world, the study suggests that personal interactions with people of other races may go a long way in counteracting stereotypes. \"If you want to reduce implicit bias ... provide experience with the other-race group,\" Quinn said. \"In particular, experience that promotes perceiving members of the other-race group as distinct individuals with unique identities.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's Why Smelling Cookies Makes You Think Of Grandma's House So how can specific scents make you recall a memory so intensely? By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Jul 22, 2015, 01:22 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT You've probably experienced this: you come home to a plate of freshly baked cookies in the kitchen, and when the scent of chocolatey goodness hits your nose you're instantaneously transported back to your grandmother's house. The phenomenon is called odor-evoked biographical memory, but how exactly does it allow for specific scents to magically bring back a memory? Advertisement \"There's a big difference between the way your body handles sight, sound, taste and touch and the way it processes smells,\" Hank Green, host of the YouTube series SciShow , says in a new episode (above). Unlike other senses, when a smell is processed in the brain, it travels directly to the amygdala and the hippocampus -- regions that both deal with emotion and memory respectively. This allows for the scent to be stored in your brain as a memory along with a certain experience or emotion. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientist Featured On 'Humans Of New York' Can Put Your Immune System Into A Mouse's Body We caught up with Nichole Danzi to talk about her work on autoimmunity. By Lila Shapiro Senior Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post Oct 26, 2015, 10:36 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Humans of New York, the popular blog that uses images of New Yorkers to create a photographic census of the city, featured a scientist last week who caught our eye: She can put your entire immune system into the body of a mouse! As she put it to Humans of New York, \u201cI can take your immune system and transplant it into a mouse that I\u2019ve genetically engineered to have no immune system of it\u2019s [sic] own, so that I can model the genetics of your immune system and find immunoregulatory defects that will determine how you are going to respond to the cellular therapy needed to treat your disease.\u201d \u201cI can take your immune system and transplant it into a mouse that I\u2019ve genetically engineered to have no immune system of it\u2019s own, so that I can model the genetics of your immune system and find immunoregulatory defects that will determine how you are going to respond to the cellular therapy needed to treat your disease.\u201d A photo posted by Humans of New York (@humansofny) on Oct 18, 2015 at 3:07pm PDT Advertisement \"That's a super hero right there,\" said one commenter on the Humans of New York Instagram account. The blog never reveals the names of its subjects, but we tracked her down: She's Nichole Danzi, an associate research scientist at Columbia University's Center for Translational Immunology. We talked to her about her work and how she became interested in this field. Unfortunately, she wouldn't disclose whether she has transferred her own immune system to any of the mice. Below is a lightly edited and condensed transcript of our discussion. When and how did it become possible to transplant the immune system of a human into a mouse? Xenografting refers to the transplantation of cells from one species into another species ... In 2002, a strain of mice known as \u2018NSG\u2019 became available, which allows for the best engraftment and growth of human cells. These mice are used extensively by biomedical researchers to study human tumors, and in our lab at the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, we use NSG mice to study the development of human immune systems. It is relatively easy to take mature human blood cells from an adult and inject them into NSG mice. The human blood cells circulate and persist in these mice for a limited period of time. But T cells in the human immune cell graft will quickly recognize the mouse host as foreign and mount an attack. To prevent this graft versus host reaction, we grow the human immune system in mice from the ground up, starting from the most immature blood stem cells. To allow a functioning and self-tolerant immune system to develop, we must also surgically implant a piece of human thymus into the mouse. The thymus is like a classroom for T cells. The thymus contains highly specialized cells that foster T cell maturation from stem cells and selects/educates T cells that will react against foreign but not self molecules. Advertisement It turns out that preparation of the thymus tissue was the key to the success of the model, and we developed a method to cryopreserve and recover the tissue. In 2012 we published a series of experiments showing how to take stem cells from an adult\u2019s bone marrow and essentially recreate that human\u2019s immune system in NSG mice. These \u2018personalized immune\u2019 mice have B cells and T cells that are tolerant to cells from the mouse host and human donor, but can react against foreign molecules. Do you have a mouse with your own immune system in it? I can\u2019t comment on this specific question. I can say that the principal investigator of my lab, Megan Sykes, was the first person to donate bone marrow and her blood stem cells did create mice with her immune system in them. In these early stages of the project she referred to the mouse model as the \u2018mini-me\u2019 model. With further discussion and input from a journal editor we changed the name to the \u2018Personalized Immune Mouse,' as this was more accurate in describing the model. Advertisement This mouse likely has a normal mouse immune system. Anthony Bradshaw/Getty Images Tell me a little about your background. How did you get into this particular field? As a graduate student I studied the development of the thymus -- an organ that sits just above your heart and gradually involutes as you age. Within the thymus, immature T cells progressively mature, and as they mature they are carefully selected to react against foreign molecules and not self. This education/selection process is called central tolerance. Defects in this selection process lead to autoimmune disease. In my graduate studies, I exclusively used mouse models to study T cell and thymus development. You can learn a lot from studying the development of mouse immune systems. However, I wanted to delve into the complexity of human immunology where individual variation in genetic makeup and environment all contribute to differences in immune function. The overarching purpose of my research at CCTI is to understand how tolerance becomes broken in patients with autoimmune diseases. The Personalized Immune Mouse Model that we developed combines strategies of central and peripheral tolerance induction and allows study of the genetic lesions that drive autoimmunity in humans. Advertisement What\u2019s the biggest challenge you\u2019ve faced in your work? There was a steep learning curve as I transitioned from a basic researcher working exclusively with mice to a translational researcher where the research makes a direct connection with human patients. Our human subjects all agree to undergo genetic testing and a bone marrow biopsy. Control subjects must be genetically matched to patients with autoimmunity. We need to coordinate the busy schedules of our human donors with stem cell isolation procedures in our lab and delicate surgeries in our mice. In addition to the logistics, the ethical and regulatory issues surrounding this project are complex. Having the direct connection to human patients, however, has been more rewarding than it has been challenging. If you look at many of the comments on the Humans of New York posting, you see that individuals who struggle with autoimmunity view this type of personalized research model as an important way forward in understanding their health problems. Powered by funding from the [The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases], we have developed specialized resources for housing, grafting, post-op care and analysis of the personalized immune mice at the CCTI. Besides being surrounded by a highly skilled team of scientists at the CCTI, I\u2019m very privileged to work with an awesome clinical team, first at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and, more recently, in the rheumatology division. Our clinical collaborators have helped foster sensitivity, a real sense of purpose and connection to the individuals dealing with chronic disease and to all of the volunteers which participate in the study. As you can imagine, without a fully supportive clinical and research team, this type of study would not be possible. Advertisement What\u2019s next for this research? Is there a particular goal you\u2019d like to see accomplished? Most autoimmune diseases have an important but complex genetic component. Each human with autoimmune disease has a unique set of genetically encoded traits that, by an unknown mechanism, disrupts regulation of the immune system to tip the balance from self-tolerance to autoimmunity. Right now, we are trying to understand the underlying immunoregulatory problems in patients with Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. For our study, we need to basically take blood stem cells from the bone marrow of patients and healthy controls and use them to \u2018reboot\u2019 these individuals\u2019 immune systems in the NSG mice. We then study the developing human immune systems in these mice over time and try to identify a specific immunoregulatory dysfunction that may have contributed to the disease. Unlike the human donors, the immune populations in the mice are not affected by disease or a lifetime of treatment. Ultimately, I would like to see these personalized immune mice actively participating in patient care. We have much more work to do before we get to this point, but perhaps some day a specific immune dysfunction identified in a patient\u2019s mouse might suggest a particular mode of immunotherapy or small molecule therapy.

A Melting Antarctica Could Sink The World's Coastlines Faster Than Predicted Sea level rise could be double previous estimates, swamping Boston and New York by 2100. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 31, 2016, 12:40 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A new paper says seas could rise more than six feet by 2100. Many cities, including New York, Boston and Hong Kong, would be partially underwater. The worst effects could be avoided if we slash or stop carbon emissions. Reuters Staff / Reuters A new report nearly doubles previous predictions for sea level rise if global emissions continue unabated, portending a doomsday scenario for many of the world's coastal cities. Advertisement The study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, looks toward the ice sheets of Antarctica, which by themselves may contribute more than three feet to sea level rise by 2100. Taken with other melting regions, including Greenland, seas could rise more than six feet, or two meters, by the end of the century. David Pollard of Penn State University and co-author Rob DeConto said the \"dire\" predictions are nearly double those recently used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as a worst-case scenario if humanity fails to curb emissions. Dozens of low-lying metropolises , including Hong Kong, New York and Sydney, would be vulnerable to these rising seas. The authors warn that places like Boston could be faced with a sea level rise of more than five feet in the next century alone. Pollard said other potential effects, similar to the damaging storm surge caused by Hurricane Sandy, could contribute to the ballooning estimates for future flood losses . Advertisement A study published last month found sea levels were rising at the fastest rate since the founding of ancient Rome 2,800 years ago, spurred by the burning of fossil fuels. The authors of that report noted without the impact of humans, seas would be rising less rapidly, or possibly falling. In an interview with The Guardian, DeConto said global warming could force \"retreat\" from cities , rather than the \"engineering of defenses\" to avoid the worst effects of sea level rise. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

But the new models cited in Pollard and DeConto's study, which use historical data from 130,000 years ago and 3 million years ago, when temperatures were warmer and seas were higher, could make a fight against the tides all for naught. The authors expanded the sea level rise estimates to the year 2500, and found that Antarctica could cause more than 50 feet of sea level rise alone. Advertisement Despite the doomsday-esque prediction, the planet still holds some hope to address the growing concerns. DeConto noted in a statement that if humans are able to slash emissions, most of the Antarctic would remain frozen . Last year's landmark climate accord forged in Paris could provide the groundwork toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. World leaders have pledged to keep global warming below a threshold of 2 degrees Celsius. But the world isn't there yet, and global temperature records -- including the one set in February, the warmest such month on record -- continue to be broken.

This Wine Chemistry Video Explains What Connoisseurs Rant About The basic chemistry of wine flavors, colors, and properties. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Jul 21, 2015, 09:04 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This video will let you hold a conversation with the wine snob at your next office party. \"No matter how much you paid for it, a bottle of wine is about 98 percent water and ethanol. It's the remaining couple of percent that make wine taste like wine\" says this YouTube by Reactions , a series by the American Chemical Society . When connoisseurs' use adjectives like \"grassy\", \"chocolatey\", and \"tannic\", they're really talking about chemical compounds in the wine. And those compounds come from three things: grapes, soil, and climate. Advertisement Each wine has a distinct chemical fingerprint because there are more than 10,000 wine grape varieties and countless minerals in soils where those grapes are grown. Climate matters because warm temperatures make more alcoholic, robust wines than do cold. So two bottles made from the same grapes in the same locations can be completely different. The wood that wine barrels are made of can even change wines chemistry. So watch here for conversation material you can use while you schmooze.

The Gorgeous 'Snow Moon' You May Have Missed This Week And what's coming up next in the night sky. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Feb 23, 2016, 10:48 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT If you totally missed Monday night\u2019s \u201csnow moon,\u201d have no fear -- plenty of people caught it and captured it on camera. What is a snow moon , and why is it so special? Each month\u2019s full moon has a different name in the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac , which vaguely claims the names \"come from the Algonquin tribes who lived in regions from New England to Lake Superior.\" February\u2019s full moon is called the \u201csnow moon,\u201d and frankly, it probably gets a lot of attention because it sounds more poetic than say, March\u2019s \u201cworm moon.\u201d (That said, we personally think January\u2019s \u201cwolf moon\u201d sounds the coolest.)

Is ISIS Taking Notes From Star Wars? A University of Chicago researcher says \"Hollywood blockbuster narratives\" help explain the pull of Islamic State recruitment videos. By Krithika Varagur Associate Editor, What's Working, The Huffington Post Jun 3, 2016, 05:02 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The cinematographic prowess of the so-called Islamic State is, by now, well-known , admired , analyzed and even mocked . The films are so good, in fact, that the U.S. government's efforts to release anti-ISIS propaganda have sort of floundered . Against this backdrop, the Department of Defense last year funded several studies through its Minerva Initiative for social science research that examine the phenomenon of extremist propaganda. One of the studies conjectures that the reason ISIS videos are so effective is they use the tropes of Hollywood blockbusters -- particularly movies with \"heroic quests\" -- to appeal to would-be extremists. Advertisement The \" Social and Neurological Construction of Martyrdom Project ,\" directed by University of Chicago professor Robert Pape, received $3.4 million from the DOD to scan people's brains as they watch ISIS recruitment videos. The cinematic opening credits of an ISIS-produced film about \"Abu Muslim Al Canadi,\" a Canadian who died fighting in Syria. ISIS-Produced Film Pape thinks the heroic narrative of modern-day ISIS videos is a stark contrast to the grainy, single-camera screeds of previous groups like al Qaeda (think: Osama bin Laden speaking to a camera). Advertisement His lab will scan subjects with FMRIs as they watch ISIS films to determine what specific parts of the films elicit the greatest brain activity. This, he thinks, is the key to unlocking the power of these videos -- and to countering them. \"ISIS doesn\u2019t just have better camera and techniques; they\u2019ve adopted a heroic narrative that comes specifically out of Hollywood screenwriters,\" Pape told The Huffington Post. \"This narrative is emotionally arousing and resonant, which can be a powerful motivator for young, would-be radicals.\" He thinks this story structure may also affect specific brain regions like the amygdala, two almond-shaped areas that are key to emotional processing . Previous research has shown that the human brain is hardwired for storytelling and to respond to narratives. The control group in the study, which commences this fall, will be shown soothing videos like a nature documentary. Advertisement The 'Hollywood Formula' Pape says ISIS videos closely mirror the 12-step narrative outlined in the popular 2007 screenwriting manual The Writer's Journey The manual is itself based on the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell, who proposed an archetypal \" hero's journey \" that is common to myths, stories and folktales from around the world. Pape thinks this playbook can be seen as a direct blueprint for ISIS, which makes longer, feature-length films, in contrast to the short videos of its predecessors like al Qaeda. \"Step by step, pace by pace, Hollywood has been using this formula to put millions and millions of viewers into seats,\" said Pape. \"And now ISIS is doing the same.\" Advertisement Christopher Vogler, author of The Writer's Journey, doesn\u2019t think ISIS is taking his 12 steps quite so literally. \"ISIS is in the same media soup as anybody else in the world, and anybody who wants to portray their own group as heroic is going to -- without even thinking about it -- duplicate that pattern,\" he said. Jeffry Halverson, an Islamic studies professor at Coastal Carolina University, said jihadist propaganda has always relied on \"culturally-embedded master narratives.\u201d Advertisement \"The difference now is that ISIS is co-opting pop culture to appeal to youth, who might be swayed by promises of excitement and adventure more than condemnations of tyranny and heresy.\" He says this differentiates ISIS from groups like al Qaeda, which used more \"traditional,\" less relatable stock figures like martyrs and tyrants instead of adventurous heroes. For instance, al Qaeda often invoked the story of \"Moses confronting the idolatrous tyrant Pharaoh for disobeying God,\" says Halverson, like in a 2002 statement that dubbed George W. Bush \"the pharaoh of this age.\" Turning the message around Pape is not the first to try and pin down the appeal of ISIS videos through analogy. Javier Lesaca, an expert with the International Observatory for Terrorism Studies, has said ISIS deliberately mimics the look of video games like \"Call of Duty\" and \"Grand Theft Auto\" to appeal to young men. Advertisement But understanding how ISIS videos work may have limited use in isolation. \"We've known for at least three years now that these videos work,\" says Pete Hatemi, a political science professor at Penn State. \"What should be our counter-strategy? That\u2019s the real question.\" Hatemi says the films are just one example that terrorists can subvert any medium for their own use. \"Terrorists' most effective weapon against democracy is our own media,\" he said. \"We have news services, and they make headlines.\" So as we watch blockbuster movies, they make recruitment films. Pape thinks the insights from his study will help the U.S. make better anti-ISIS videos. \"Their effort isn't working because they fail to engage viewers' emotions the way ISIS videos do,\" says Pape. He suggests the government adopt its own \"heroic logic\" to counter the vision of ISIS. Advertisement \"Countering the ISIS hero metric would involve emphasizing that the individuals in ISIS are not working for the community and are not patriots, but they are, instead, individually motivated, and should be seen as foreign occupiers whose desires are at odds with the local community,\" he suggested. Hatemi, on the other hand, thinks it doesn\u2019t need to be that hard. \"We could also just pick up what ISIS leaves out,\" he said. \"They don't show the beatings, torture, rations, and terrible living conditions in an ISIS propaganda film. If we showed that, it could be half the battle.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Oct 25, 2015, 11:48 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT With Halloween around the corner, you're likely to see many zombies, mummies and ghosts walking around. But the dead don't just serve as costume inspiration for Allhallows Eve. In fact, they help to make life better for us all year round. When people die and leave their bodies to science, it can result in much more than a simple organ donation. Keep reading for some of the helpful and little-known ways that the dead keep on interacting with the living. 1. Giving new life Doctors \"harvest\" all sorts of fully functioning organs and tissues from the deceased that can be used to save the lives of patients in need of organ transplants. Head transplants might even be possible in the near future. Advertisement 2. Gross anatomy The best way to learn how something works is to take it apart -- and the human body is no exception. Medical students often examine dead bodies to learn how to operate on the living. Advertisement 3. Practice makes perfect And yes, after students take dead bodies apart, they learn how to put them back together. Sometimes, when the real thing is unavailable, synthetic cadavers are used in the classroom. 4. Driving dummies Although dummies are mostly used for crash testing, human bodies have been used to get specific data on the ways that car crashes can damage organs. Advertisement 5. Body ballistics Ballistics researchers have used cadavers to test the non-lethality of rubber bullets, as well as the side effects of being shot while wearing bulletproof vests and other protective clothing. Advertisement 6. Rotting away Early in their careers, crime scene investigators need to learn how to deduce the time and nature of a victim's death. Often, they receive their training at research facilities known as \"body farms,\" where they can examine bodies that have been left to decay in various conditions. u/Dasbild 7. Houston, we have a problem NASA has used corpses in tests to determine the risks that astronauts face when they use tricky maneuvers to return to Earth from the International Space Station. Advertisement 8. On display Museums and other public exhibits around the world have showcased preserved organs, bodily systems and entire human bodies for education and entertainment. Advertisement 9. One-two punch Researchers are using the arms of cadavers to punch and slap padded dumbbells in the hopes of learning more about the evolution of the human hand. They argue that the hand evolved not just for dexterity but for fisticuffs, too.

Scientists Turn To DNA Technology To Search For Loch Ness Monster The researchers plan to scour the Loch Ness next month for evidence of its supposed inhabitant. Reuters May 23, 2018, 10:49 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING LONDON (Reuters) - A global team of scientists plans to scour the icy depths of Loch Ness next month using environmental DNA (eDNA) in an experiment that may discover whether Scotland\u2019s fabled monster really does, or did, exist. The use of eDNA sampling is already well established as a tool for monitoring marine life like whales and sharks. Advertisement Whenever a creature moves through its environment, it leaves behind tiny fragments of DNA from skin, scales, feathers, fur, faeces and urine. \u201cThis DNA can be captured, sequenced and then used to identify that creature by comparing the sequence obtained to large databases of known genetic sequences from hundreds of thousands of different organisms,\u201d said team spokesman Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago in New Zealand. The ruined Urquhart Castle towering over the western shore of Loch Ness at Drumnadrochit. The loch is famed for the mythical monster Nessie which has been spotted by people from all over the world. Colin McPherson via Getty Images Advertisement The first written record of a monster relates to the Irish monk St Columba, who is said to have banished a \u201cwater beast\u201d to the depths of the River Ness in the 6th century. The most famous picture of Nessie, known as the \u201csurgeon\u2019s photo\u201d, was taken in 1934 and showed a head on a long neck emerging from the water. It was revealed 60 years later to have been a hoax that used a sea monster model attached to a toy submarine. This photograph, one of two pictures known as the 'surgeon's photographs,' was allegedly taken by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson, though it was later exposed as a hoax. One of the participants, Chris Spurling, revealed on his deathbed that the pictures were staged by himself, Marmaduke and Ian Wetherell, and Wilson. Keystone via Getty Images Advertisement Countless unsuccessful attempts to track down the monster have been made in the years since, notably in 2003 when the BBC funded an extensive scientific search that used 600 sonar beams and satellite tracking to sweep the full length of the loch. The most recent attempt was two years ago when a high-tech marine drone found a monster - but not the one it was looking for. The discovery turned out to be replica used in the 1970 film \u201cThe Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\u201d, which sank nearly 50 years ago. Gemmell\u2019s team, which comprises scientists from Britain, Denmark, the United States, Australia and France, is keen to stress the expedition is more than just a monster hunt. \u201cWhile the prospect of looking for evidence of the Loch Ness monster is the hook to this project, there is an extraordinary amount of new knowledge that we will gain from the work about organisms that inhabit Loch Ness,\u201d Gemmell said on his university website. A model of the Loch Ness monster stands outside a visitor centre on March 30, 2012 in Drumnadrochit, United Kingdom. The village lies on the shores of the Loch Ness.

Sharks Follow Their Noses For A Lot More Than Just Prey, Study Finds And we thought their teeth were scary.... By Chloe Fox Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Jan 6, 2016, 11:22 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT We've known for a while that sharks can navigate long distances in relatively direct paths (the Great White is even known to traverse the Atlantic Ocean !), but how exactly they do it has been something of a mystery. Now, thanks to a new study out of the University of California, San Diego , scientists have confirmed that sharks essentially smell their way through the open ocean. Sharks have a strong sense of smell that can help them find their way around the ocean. David Fleetham/Visuals Unlimited, Inc. via Getty Images Advertisement After capturing 26 leopard sharks near La Jolla, California, researchers temporarily impaired the sense of smell for 11 of them. The entire group, which is typically a nearshore species, was then taken about five and a half miles offshore and released. In order to prevent clever sharks from retracing their steps , the scientists did their best to confuse them, including by masking geomagnetic cues and driving the boat in figure-eight maneuvers. Researchers found that after four hours, the sharks with a normal sense of smell made their way about 62 percent closer to the shore, \"following relatively straight paths.\" But the sharks with an impaired sense of smell only ended up about 37 percent closer, \"following significantly more tortuous paths,\" according to a press release. Advertisement The results suggest that the sense of smell -- likely the ability to pick up on chemical gradients in the water -- contributes greatly to a shark's navigational abilities. Sharks' brains help them detect tiny amounts of chemicals in the water. AGoyen via Getty Images Sharks are built to have a keen sense of smell . Their nostrils, which are used solely for smelling, are lined with specialized cells that pick up on dissolved chemicals in the water, and their brains have enlarged olfactory bulbs, allowing them to detect extremely small amounts of certain chemicals. Advertisement This skill comes is especially handy when it comes to hunting prey. According to the American Museum of Natural History, some sharks can \"detect their prey at one part per 10 billion; that's one drop in an Olympic-sized swimming pool !\" Turns out, there's just no throwing them off the scent.

Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano Sees A Mesmerizing River Of Lava Can't. Look. Away. By Landess Kearns Senior Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Aug 28, 2015, 08:41 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Need a reminder of Mother Nature's might? Then, boy, do we have the video for you. A large lava breakout began early Thursday morning from the Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d cone of Kilauea volcano on the southeast part of Hawaii's Big Island. In the footage above, the glowing breakout is seen flowing through a landscape of black lava rock, on the northeast flank of Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d. Advertisement Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes , and Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d in particular has been continuously erupting for more than 32 years . According to the U.S. Geological Survey's daily Kilauea updates, the lava initially broke out on Thursday around 1 a.m. local time. The breakout stemmed from a lava tube currently feeding other flows further to the northeast. \"It is too soon to tell how important this breakout is or if it will affect the vigor of the distant flows to the northeast,\" the USGS wrote in Thursday's update. The flow remained active into Thursday evening, but has since stalled. Advertisement For those who live on the Big Island, lava flows are an accepted and, at times, trying part of life. Last year, for instance, the small rural community of Pahoa was threatened by a flow that burned one house down. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These Photos Show How The World Might Look To A Person With Autism \"They don't look at most things in a typical way.\" By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Oct 24, 2015, 07:02 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Researchers created photos to show how people with autism perceive their environments. QI Zhao Individuals with autism see the world through very different eyes than those who don't have it, which impacts how they interact with their environment. Research from Cal Tech, published online Thursday, found this is because a wide range of visual input is interpreted differently in the brain of a person with autism spectrum disorder. Advertisement \"It is known that people with ASD have difficulty often figuring out how other people feel or what their social gestures mean, from looking at their faces and body postures,\" Dr. Ralph Adolphs, the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"This may be because they pay attention to them differently.\" In other words, when a person with autism exhibits repetitive or antisocial behaviors, doesn't make contact or has difficulty communicating -- the main characteristics of the disorder -- it could be because of their perception and attention focus in a given situation. \"Among other findings, our work shows that the story is not as simple as saying 'people with ASD don't look normally at faces,'\" Adolphs said in a statement. \"They don't look at most things in a typical way.\" Advertisement The researchers explored this by creating a series of images that depict how a person with autism experiences their environment. For the study the research team showed 700 images to 20 individuals with high-functioning autism and 19 control subjects, who didn't have autism, while an eye-tracking device recorded their attention patterns on different objects within the images. Check out the renderings below to see what the researchers discovered. For each pair of images, the top image shows how it is perceived by an individual with autism, while the bottom shows how it is perceived by the control subject. In this set of images, note how the person with autism is more focused on the back of the referee's head, rather than the player's face. Advertisement Qi Zhao Qi Zhao In these images, the person with autism pays more attention to the tree and the sky rather than the mother and baby elephant in the foreground. Advertisement Qi Zhao Qi Zhao While in these images, the person with autism is not paying attention to the trajectory of the football in the same way that the control subject did. Advertisement Qi Zhao Qi Zhao As you can see, the individuals with autism are less drawn to faces and other \"meaningful\" objects in the scene -- a tendency which can lead to challenges in social situations. Advertisement \"This probably makes it more difficult for [people with autism] to socialize, especially in a complex environment like a party, because they may have difficulty knowing where to [direct their attention],\" Adolphs told HuffPost. The findings could in the future help clinicians identify autism disorder subtypes, which would enable them to better diagnose individual cases. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Our study is one initial step in trying to discover what kinds of different autisms there actually are ... Once we have identified those subtypes, we can begin to ask if different kinds of treatment might be best for each kind of subtype.\" Advertisement More and more, we're seeing that autism cannot be approached with a one size fits all diagnosis -- and further research may helpful in devising tailored treatments that target the many nuances of the disorder.

Buzz Aldrin Dances With John Travolta, Shows Off Some Out-Of-This World Moves \"I thought I held my own.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jul 20, 2015, 01:03 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT When you've done the moon walk for real, the last thing you need is dancing lessons. But space legend Buzz Aldrin couldn't resist picking up a few pointers from actor John Travolta. The two showed off their smooth moves at an event held Saturday night at Kennedy Space Center in Florida to celebrate the kickoff of the Apollo astronaut's ShareSpace Foundation , a charity aimed at boosting science literacy in kids by incorporating arts into science education. Advertisement \"I thought I held my own,\" Aldrin wrote on a Facebook post. \" What do you think ?\" Speaking at the event, which was hosted by actor Seth Green, Travolta praised the Apollo astronaut. \"To be here at the Kennedy Space Center, under a Saturn V rocket with an American hero like Buzz Aldrin, it's just quite a privilege ,\" Travolta said, according to Florida Today. He added: \"To start a nonprofit is probably one of the most selfless things a person can do. There is no personal monetary gain from it, it's a lot of extra work and effort. It's not an easy task. But, yet, here's this legend who's doing just that.\" Monday is the 46th anniversary of the lunar landing in which Neil Armstrong and Aldrin became the first and second humans, respectively, to set foot on the moon.

If You Missed The 2015 Solar Eclipse, These Photos Provide A Stunning Recap Of The Celestial Event LOOK: Solar Eclipse Stuns Skywatchers Around The World By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 20, 2015, 11:36 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Millions of skywatchers across Northern Europe and parts of Asia and Africa were treated to a rare solar eclipse early Friday morning . (Scroll down for photos). The point of greatest eclipse occurred above the Norwegian Sea around 5:46 a.m EDT on March 20, 2015, with the greatest period of darkness lasting for about three minutes, BBC reported. Advertisement Though the eclipse was not visible for those in the U.S., and clouds obscured the skies for some viewers in the U.K. and Faroe Islands , many professional and amateur photographers were able to capture spectacular views of the new moon blotting out the sun. The next total solar eclipse that will be visible in parts of the U.S. will occur on Aug. 21, 2017. If you missed the show, check out a stunning recap below.

Unusual Asteroid Could Be An Interstellar Guest To Our Solar System The supposed \"interstellar immigrant\" is located near Jupiter but has an atypical orbit. By Carol Kuruvilla Religion Reporter, HuffPost May 21, 2018, 04:48 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Researchers postulate that a peculiar asteroid spotted near Jupiter is a permanent guest from a completely different solar system. In an article published Monday in the U.K.\u2019s Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , the researchers say their studies indicate that asteroid 2015 BZ509 (nicknamed BZ) is actually an \u201cinterstellar immigrant\u201d that has been circling the sun ever since our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Advertisement One of the researchers, Fathi Namouni of France\u2019s C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur Observatory, told HuffPost that would make the discovery the first of its kind. \u201cThere is no other asteroid in the solar system that moves around the sun and is known to have been born outside the solar system,\u201d he wrote in an email. Scientists Fathi Namouni of C\u00f4te d'Azur Observatory in France and Helena Morais of S\u00e3o Paulo State University in Brazil claim asteroid 2015 BZ509 is a guest from an alien solar system that has taken up residence in our own. adventtr via Getty Images Advertisement BZ was discovered in 2014, according to The New York Times . The asteroid, a little less than two miles wide, is located near Jupiter and circles the sun every 11.6 years. Scientists noticed that BZ has an unusual orbit . Instead of circling around the sun in the same direction as Jupiter , BZ has a retrograde orbit, meaning it circles the sun in the opposite direction. Namouni and the co-author of Monday\u2019s article, Helena Morais of Brazil\u2019s Universidade Estadual Paulista, were curious about why the asteroid moved in this unusual way. Using a time machine-like simulation, they recreated BZ\u2019s possible movements over the past 4.5 billion years using their knowledge of the asteroid\u2019s current orbit. Advertisement \u201cSurprisingly we found going back 4.5 billion years in the past, that the asteroid was moving exactly where it is now,\u201d Namouni wrote. \u201cBut at 4.5 billion years in the past, all solar system objects, planets, asteroids and comets moved exactly in the same direction around the sun. This tells us that the asteroid was not born in the solar system but captured from outside it.\u201d Other astrophysicists have come up with alternate explanations for BZ\u2019s retrograde orbit and suggested, for example, that the object could have come from the Oort Cloud , an icy mass of debris that some astronomers propose exists near the outer reaches of the solar system. Others say BZ could have come from Planet Nine , a hypothetical, hidden planet that some claim could lie beyond the dwarf planet Pluto. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Regardless, Namouni believes BZ holds a wealth of information for scientists. Its relative proximity to Earth means scientists could analyze an object potentially from an alien solar system without needing to leave our own. Namouni said a robotic mission to BZ is \u201cperfectly possible\u201d with current technology. Advertisement Analyzing the asteroid\u2019s chemical composition could help scientists understand how our own solar system formed \u2015 and even provide insights into the origin of life. For example, if scientists discover that BZ contains water, it could signal that interstellar asteroids can deliver water to Earth and \u201chence indirectly contribute to the appearance of life,\u201d Namouni wrote.

This Is The Longest-Lasting Stellar Eclipse Ever Observed Say hello to the longest-lasting stellar eclipse ever observed. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 22, 2016, 01:23 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Illustration of binary star system that produces the longest-duration eclipses ever observed. Jeremy Teaford/Vanderbilt University Total solar eclipses are short-lived events, lasting no more than a matter of minutes. Eclipses of other stars in our galaxy -- so-called stellar eclipses -- can last a bit longer. How much longer? A team of astronomers just discovered a binary star system in which one red giant star orbiting another eclipses it for a remarkable three and a half years. Advertisement That makes this the longest-lasting stellar eclipse ever observed. Known only as TYC 2505-672-1, the system -- the discovery of which is described in a paper that was accepted last month for publication in Astronomical Journal -- also has the longest period between eclipses ever seen. Sixty-nine years pass between one eclipse and the next. The system, located in the constellation Leo Minor, eclipsed during World War II and again from 2011 through 2014, New Scientist reported. The next won't come until April of 2080. It's easy enough to understand solar eclipses, in which light from the sun is blocked as the moon passes between it and the Earth. Ditto for lunar eclipses , in which the moon appears to dim as it passes through the Earth's shadow. Advertisement But how can one star blot out another if both emit light? The team, led by astronomers from Vanderbilt and Harvard, believe it's because one of the stars in the system is encased in a cloud of dust and gas so thick that it blocks light. \"About the only way to get these really long eclipse times is with an extended disk of opaque material ,\" Joseph Rodriguez, an astronomy graduate student at Vanderbilt University and the first author of a paper about the discovery, said in a written statement. \"Nothing else is big enough to block out a star for months at a time.\" (Story continues below graph.) At top, the measured brightness of the newly-discovered system over the last 120 years showing two eclipses (1940s and 2011-2014). At bottom, a zoom-in of the top figure showing the last 9 years of measured brightness showing that the eclipse lasts about 3.5 years. Joseph Rodriguez / Vanderbilt University Advertisement The stars in the system orbit each other at a distance of 20 astronomical units (AU), according to the astronomers. That's really, really far. One AU -- roughly the average distance from the Earth to the sun -- is 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers. Twenty AU is roughly the distance from the sun to Uranus. The previous record-holder for stellar eclipses was Epsilon Aurigue , a yellow giant star that is eclipsed by its companion star every 27 years for periods lasting from 640 to 730 days, according to the statement (see video animation below). That system is comparatively easy to study, as it is brighter than TYC 2505-672-1 and much closer -- only 2,200 light-years from Earth as compared to 10,000 light-years for TYC 2505-672-1. Advertisement To characterize a star system as dim and distant as TYC 2505-672-1, the team made use of observations from sources including the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope and the American Association of Variable Star Observers . The team also relied upon a remarkable collection of photographic plates of the northern sky made between 1890 and 1989. \"It's absolutely incredible that we can use astronomical data on century timescales,\" Rodriguez told The Huffington Post. \"It's bringing us into a new age of astrophysics.\" Advertisement Also on HuffPost: 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA has mostly had experience with engineers and scientists. We've chosen to reach out to places like [the Center of Theological Inquiry] CTI where your philosophy is to bring interdisciplinary groups together to talk about these very important questions. We tend to try to go to the best.\" -- Mary Voytek, NASA Astrobiology Program Director ( Click Here to Listen: Voytek podcast with CTI Director ) \"Astrobiology doesn't exist, what are its laws?\" -- Jerry Fodor At a meeting last May in New York with Andrew Pohorille , NASA's senior-most scientist on origins of life, Pohorille told me that there is a certain factor to life that so far cannot be captured in the lab, i.e., life is not purely a technical matter, and that he does not expect \"we\" will find life anywhere else in the solar system, including Mars -- he added that there is as yet no consensus on what life is. But what Andrew Pohorille did not tell me at the time was that just a few days prior to our meeting, NASA's Astrobiology Program -- headed by Mary Voytek -- awarded $1.108M (5% of its annual budget) to the Center of Theological Inquiry , a religious think tank with more than $23M in assets , to investigate how the world's religions might respond to the discovery of life on other planets. John Templeton Foundation is co-sponsoring the two-year project (2015-2017) with a $1.7M grant to CTI. Advertisement The attempt by Templeton to insinuate its divine motive into science is aided by the failure of science to understand the origin and evolution of life. Templeton funds many projects in these two areas seemingly not to find answers but to factor in religion. Templeton's science and religion director Paul Wason has refused my request for an interview to discuss these matters. CTI is a Princeton-based nonprofit corporation that does advanced theological research. It was spun out of, and continues to work in close association with, Princeton Theological Seminary -- America's largest Presbyterian seminary. CTI's academic advisory panel and board of trustees are mostly Christian scholars and/or advocates (a couple of trustees are also wealth management professionals ). Ganesh followers are not principal investigators in the NASA-JTF project as far as I can tell. . . Each of the 24 research fellows participating in CTI's astrobiology inquiry is being paid $70K a year from the joint award to CTI. The 2016-2017 team will soon take up the challenge following the investigations of the 2015-2016 team. The first of the 2016-2017 team to announce his NASA/JTF/CTI astrobiology fellowship online that I've noticed is Jesus College's Rev. Dr. Tim Jenkins , Assistant Director of Research in the Study of Religion. Advertisement To give a sense of the moving ground, following a February 2016 astrobiology symposium at CTI that Frank Rosenzweig , principal investigator for NASA Astrobiology's University of Montana team, and another NAI astrobiologist participated in -- NASA's online newsletter reported this: \"Both [NAI] scholars are interested in learning about the origins of life by replicating evolutionary processes in the laboratory. Rosenzweig has undertaken research that seeks to study the process of evolution in such a way that history and contingency are controlled. In this way we can learn about not only what happened in the past but also what could have happened, but didn't. That helps us know more about what might be possible elsewhere in the universe.\" More of NASA's astrobiology strategy for the next decade can be found in its latest roadmap: Astrobiology Strategy 2015 . Lindsay Hays of California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is editor-in-chief. Advertisement Microbes are given some attention in a section titled: \"How Does Our Ignorance About Microbial Life on Earth Hinder Our Understanding of the Limits to Life?\" Curiously, however, there's not a word in the entire 256-page document (including the glossary) about the existence of viruses -- the biggest part of the biosphere -- let alone their consortial and persistent nature , when the new thinking in science is \" virus first \" and that persistence may be just as crucial to life as replication. Templeton last year also awarded $5.4 M for origin of life investigations to the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution, with funds being administered by FAME synthetic biologist Steve Benner (who once quipped, \"If you don't have a theory of life, you can't find aliens -- unless they shoot you in the leg with a ray gun.\") AND $5.6M to ELSI -- the Japanese government's earth science institute in Tokyo - for its ELSI Origins Network, headed by astrophysicist Piet Hut also of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Steve Benner is listed as a reviewer on NASA's latest roadmap and is on the editorial board of Astrobiology Journal whose senior editors include NAI's new chief Penny Boston as well as ISSOL (International Society for the Study of Origin of Life) president Dave Deamer. Astrobiology Journal is put together in the Kennewick, Washington home of Sherry Cady, a geologist who serves as editor in chief, and her husband Lawrence P. Cady, a fiction writer who serves as the journal's managing editor and copy editor -- according to LP Cady. The magazine is one of 80 of Mary Ann Liebert Inc.'s \"authoritative\" journals and has close ties to other NASA-funded scientists who serve as reviewers. Advertisement If anything substantive is likely to happen as a result of (or in spite of) Templeton funding on origin of life, I would expect it to come from Steve Benner's project, which includes people like George E. Fox who collaborated early on with Carl Woese on Archaea, and Harry Lonsdale origin of life research funds recipient, Niles Lehman -- plus Benner himself and eight others. On the other hand, I have serious reservations about the NASA award of $1.1M of public funds to CTI. What ever happened to the separation of church and state? One of the 2015-2016 CTI recipients of NASA-Templeton funds is Lucas Mix, an Episcopalian priest who belongs to an organization called the Society of Ordained Scientists . He is also a member of CTI. LUCAS MIX Mix was editor-in-chief of Astrobiology Journal 's 2006: Astrobiology Primer , an 81-page insert in the journal that referred to natural selection as the prime mover of evolution (Sherry & Lawrence Cady were the journal's editor and managing editor at the time.). Mix is also a lead author of NASA's Astrobiology Strategy 2015 contributing a section in which he states: \"The results of astrobiology research will have broad societal impact, affecting the way we think about life in the context of ethics, law, philosophy, theology, and a host of other issues.\" Advertisement I refer to Lucas Mix in my conversation with UCLA paleontologist Bruce Runnegar -- who was NAI chief at the time Mix's Astrobiology Primer got underway -- in my book The Altenberg 16: An Expos\u00e9 of the Evolution Industry . I asked Bruce Runnegar about the Primer NAI supported on his watch: \" Suzan Mazur : The explanation for natural selection being promoted as the sole mechanism of evolution in that publication -- the decision about that would have been whose? Bruce Runnegar : This is not a decision. The people who compiled that Primer are aiming to provide an educational service and so they write or wrote or acquired definitions of words. Basically trying to explain the jargon of astrobiology. Some of these explanations almost anybody could have different opinions about. There were reviews of the document by scientists connected with the institute [NAI], but I don't think there's any attempt to provide a stamp of approval for any particular definitions.\" To put this all in further context, following are excerpts of my February 2008 conversation with current CTI/NASA/Templeton investigator Lucas Mix: Advertisement LUCAS MIX Lucas Mix : The Primer came together over a six-year period. The first four years of that I was a student in biology at Harvard. The last two years of that I was a seminarian. Suzan Mazur : This was a publication that was supported by NASA, although it's not an official publication of NASA. Do you know what the extent of funding was from NASA? Lucas Mix : Well, I proposed the Primer to the NASA Astrobiology Institute as a way of promoting interdisciplinary education and as a joint activity of graduate students in astrobiology for their education and networking and career development. . . . I would say 2002, 2003 that NASA Astrobiology Institute became officially interested. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : There were 70 contributors, 10 editors. Were people paid to do this? Lucas Mix : No. I was the only one who was paid and I was paid for a small amount of travel and to go to a couple of conferences and to do the editing and contacting people. Suzan Mazur : How long did it take you to put the publication together? Lucas Mix : The idea came about 2000. It appeared in print in November 2006. . . . Astrobiology Journa l is put out by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. . . . It's a peer reviewed journal and the Primer appears as an article in that journal. Suzan Mazur : The big question is, regarding the discussion of evolution in the Primer , what's cited is that one of the features of life is \"progressive adaptation via Darwinian evolution.\" But there's no mention of any other approach to evolution aside from Darwinian selection. With all the breaking news about alternative evolutionary approaches, why wasn't there any room for alternatives? Advertisement Lucas Mix : To start with, it's important to recognize that the Primer is an attempt in 81 pages to summarize the background information of all of astrobiology and that what happened was that we solicited input as to what needed to be in the document and then we tried to edit draconianly short descriptions of topics. So the evolution section really is meant to give only the most introductory of remarks about evolution. Suzan Mazur : But it was introduced in a dogmatic way regarding Darwin. I mean, this is it. This is the way it is. Lucas Mix : That was not my impression. Suzan Mazur : But nothing else was offered. Lucas Mix : A great deal of work was done to ensure that it talked about neutral selection. Suzan Mazur : There was nothing about self-organization, for instance, in your Primer . Lucas Mix : Well, there are certain areas in the Prime r that were not as full as they could have been. And one of the benefits of doing another version of the Primer , an online version of the Primer , as I hope occurs -- is that some of those gaps will be filled in. I can't say without sitting down with it and the writers what exactly I feel should or should not have been in that section. But definitely overall I'm happy to say that there are things we left out. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : Is that information going in another version? Lucas Mix : Well, I think that would have to be a discussion between whoever the editors are and whoever the author of that section is. Evolution is not an uncontroversial topic, at least in terms of how it's presented and what you see is the result of a year's worth of writing and researching and editing. So I wouldn't wish to comment on what another year's worth of writing, researching and editing might bring. Suzan Mazur : Are you still involved with the project? Lucas Mix : At present there is not officially any project. It is quite possible that Mary Ann Liebert will release updates or a second version of the Primer at some point in the future. We talked about it. It's probably not something that will happen in the next 12 months. . . . Suzan Mazur : You're an Episcopalian minister now. I spoke to Reverend Dan Conklin the other day and he said yours was an emerging congregation. Advertisement Lucas Mix : Yes. Suzan Mazu r: Meaning that you don't have a space yet or it's an experimental type of church? Lucas Mix : Experimental is a very good way to describe it. The \"emerging church\" is a movement that recognizes some of the long-time practices and doctrines of the church should be revisioned and because it is emerging, it is to some extent experimental, the direction which they will emerge and what will emerge is not fully determined. Suzan Mazur : Did you participate yesterday? Did they have the Darwin on Sunday at Epiphany parish? Lucas Mix : I preached at Epiphany Parish. Suzan Mazur : Rev. Conklin mentioned that you've had this program four years in a row. He said that the discussion does get thrown open to things like various challenges to Darwinian natural selection. Did you noticed any of that? Did that happen yesterday? Was there any dissent? . . . . Lucas Mix : Not too much. I would come back to the difference between positive selection and neutral selection. I don't think that Darwin had the concept of modern statistics that is so essential to the way evolutionary theory is conceived of these days. So I'm very uncomfortable saying that I'm in the school of Darwin and I do think the questions of probability and the word random that gets used in a number of ways are very much issues today in the popular conception of evolution. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : One of the reasons why self-organization was excluded from the Primer was not because of any religious affiliation that you might have? Lucas Mix : By no means. The Primer should have no religious content. I certainly hope that it does not. I can't guarantee that nothing has snuck in, but. . . Suzan Mazur : You're still doing the martial arts? Lucas Mix : Yes. I work with Enso Center for International Arts. That's a family business. And I should probably mention that I am currently working on a book for Harvard Press called the Astrobiological World , which will be a much more accessible entrance into the world of astrobiology and will contain information about the interaction of religion and science. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : And when is your book coming out? Lucas Mix : My expectation is February or March 2009. . . . Religion has nothing to do with science and the NASA Astrobiology Program has squandered precious public funds -- 5% of its annual budget -- for an investigation into how the world's religions might respond to the discovery of life on other planets. It has handed over $1.108M to a religious think tank, a nonprofit corporation with wealth management professionals on its board that already has in excess of $23M in assets. It is money that could be spent productively on authentic journalism to more effectively expose the politics that drives world disasters, including the use of group mind control, religious and otherwise.

LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING By Ariel Conn Founders of AI/robotics companies, including Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX, OpenAI) and Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman (Google\u2019s DeepMind), call for autonomous weapons ban, as the United Nations delays negotiations. Leaders from AI and robotics companies around the world have released an open letter calling on the United Nations to ban autonomous weapons , often referred to as killer robots. Advertisement Founders and CEOs of nearly 100 companies from 26 countries signed the letter, which warns: Lethal autonomous weapons threaten to become the third revolution in warfare. Once developed, they will permit armed conflict to be fought at a scale greater than ever, and at timescales faster than humans can comprehend. In December, 123 member nations of the U.N. had agreed to move forward with formal discussions about autonomous weapons, with 19 members already calling for an outright ban. However, the next stage of discussions, which were originally scheduled to begin on Aug. 21 \u2015 the release date of the open letter \u2015 were postponed because a small number of nations hadn\u2019t paid their fees. The letter was organized and announced by Toby Walsh, a prominent AI researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. In an email, he noted that, \u201csadly, the U.N. didn\u2019t begin today its formal deliberations around lethal autonomous weapons.\u201d Walsh continued: Advertisement There is, however, a real urgency to take action here and prevent a very dangerous arms race. This open letter demonstrates clear concern and strong support for this from the Robotics & AI industry. The open letter included such signatories as: Elon Musk , founder of Tesla, SpaceX and OpenAI (U.S.) Demis Hassabis , founder and CEO at Google\u2019s DeepMind (U.K.) Mustafa Suleyman , founder and Head of Applied AI at Google\u2019s DeepMind (U.K.) Esben \u00d8stergaard , founder & CTO of Universal Robotics (Denmark) Jerome Monceaux , founder of Aldebaran Robotics, makers of Nao and Pepper robots (France) J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber , leading deep learning expert and founder of Nnaisense (Switzerland) Yoshua Bengio , leading deep learning expert and founder of Element AI (Canada) In reference to the signatories, the press release for the letter added: \u201cTheir companies employ tens of thousands of researchers, roboticists and engineers, are worth billions of dollars and cover the globe from North to South, East to West: Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, U.K., United Arab Emirates and USA.\u201d Advertisement Bengio explained why he signed, saying, \u201cthe use of AI in autonomous weapons hurts my sense of ethics.\u201d He added that the development of autonomous weapons \u201cwould be likely to lead to a very dangerous escalation,\u201d and that \u201cit would hurt the further development of AI\u2019s good applications.\u201d He concluded his statement to the Future of Life Institute saying that this \u201cis a matter that needs to be handled by the international community, similarly to what has been done in the past for some other morally wrong weapons (biological, chemical, nuclear).\u201d Stuart Russell, another of the world\u2019s preeminent AI researchers and founder of Bayesian Logic Inc., added: Unless people want to see new weapons of mass destruction \u2015 in the form of vast swarms of lethal microdrones \u2015 spreading around the world, it\u2019s imperative to step up and support the United Nations\u2019 efforts to create a treaty banning lethal autonomous weapons. This is vital for national and international security. Ryan Gariepy, founder & CTO of Clearpath Robotics was the first to sign the letter. For the press release, he noted, \u201cAutonomous weapons systems are on the cusp of development right now and have a very real potential to cause significant harm to innocent people along with global instability.\u201d The open letter ends with similar concerns. It states: These can be weapons of terror, weapons that despots and terrorists use against innocent populations, and weapons hacked to behave in undesirable ways. We do not have long to act. Once this Pandora\u2019s box is opened, it will be hard to close. We therefore implore the High Contracting Parties to find a way to protect us all from these dangers. The letter was announced in Melbourne, Australia at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which draws many of the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence researchers. Two years ago, at the last IJCAI meeting, Walsh released another open letter , which called on countries to avoid engaging in an AI arms race. To date, that previous letter has been signed by over 20,000 people, including over 3,100 AI/robotics researchers. Advertisement Read the letter here .

Your Birthday May Play A Role In Whether You Suffer From Allergies Here's how. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 30, 2016, 02:46 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Specific \"markers\" on DNA can link your birth season to your risk of suffering from allergies, a new study finds. P.E. Reed via Getty Images Scientists have long noticed a strange correlation between when we're born and how likely it is that we'll experience certain health problems, including allergies. Thanks to an international team of researchers, we now can at least partly explain how this happens: The season you were born in can leave certain \"markers\" on your DNA that may influence your health, said Dr. John Holloway, professor of allergy and respiratory genetics at the University of Southampton in England and a co-author of the new study. Advertisement \"If we can go on to identify what it is about season of birth that causes these changes, this could potentially be modifiable, allowing the development of preventative strategies for allergies,\" he told The Huffington Post. For the study, which was published in the journal Allergy on Tuesday, researchers scanned DNA samples from 367 18-year-olds who were born on the Isle of Wight in England. They analyzed specific markers, called DNA methylation , in the samples, and examined whether different markers could be associated with what time of year a person was born and whether they suffer from any allergic diseases, including asthma and eczema. The researchers then measured how susceptible each person was to developing such allergies and noted which participants reported suffering from hay fever, asthma or eczema when they were 1, 4, 10, and 18 years old, Live Science reported . Advertisement It turns out that we carry certain DNA markers into adulthood -- and that some are both associated with the season we're born in and whether it's likely we'll develop certain allergies. For example, the researchers linked being born in the fall with an increased risk of eczema. Children born in autumn or winter may have a higher chance of developing asthma, The Telegraph reported . \u201c[T]he epigenetic marks discovered in this study could also potentially be the mechanism for other seasonally influenced diseases and traits too, not just allergy.\u201d - Dr. Gabrielle Lockett, researcher at the University of Southampton Advertisement Similar findings emerged when the researchers looked at markers found in a group of 8-year-olds. However, the researchers didn't see the markers when they tested their findings in a group of newborn babies -- which suggests that DNA methylation changes might be a result of a person's environment and not occur while in the womb. \"It might sound like a horoscope by the seasons, but now we have scientific evidence for how that horoscope could work,\" Dr. Gabrielle Lockett, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southampton and first author of the study, said in a statement . \"Because season of birth influences so many things, the epigenetic marks discovered in this study could also potentially be the mechanism for other seasonally influenced diseases and traits too, not just allergy.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Last year, for instance, data scientists at Columbia University Medical Center in New York discovered an odd correlation between the month a person was born and their risk of developing not only allergies but also health problems including heart disease, viral infections and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . Previous studies have also linked season of birth with the risk of some food allergies . Advertisement More research is needed to explore these associations, as Holloway said it's unclear why they exist. \"It could be, for example, sunlight levels affecting maternal vitamin D levels either when the baby is in utero or in breastmilk after birth. It could be a postnatal effect determined by season of birth -- such as, does the child encounter it\u2019s first winter cold season shortly after birth or after nine months when its immune system is more mature,\" he said. \"Is it something to do with mother\u2019s diet as the nutrient content of our diets have been shown to vary with the season? ... We don\u2019t know, but this is what we hope to go on to find out.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

The Future of the Car Is Electric By the 1920s, America had developed a better system of infrastructure. This meant that vehicles needed to go longer distances. The discovery of large petroleum reserves had reduced the price of gasoline. This made the gasoline car more attractive to consumers. By Patrick Daniel, Contributor Co-Founder The Future Society Co-Founder The Future Society Mar 17, 2015, 05:29 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

The best-selling pamphlet Common Sense by Thomas Paine defined its era, the American Revolution. It inspired people in the North American colonies to fight and declare independence from the British Crown. It was merely 48 pages long, but its impact was tremendous. In simple language Paine's text appealed to the common man. It was passionate. It was timely. It widened the public discourse. It shattered old ideas, and introduced new ones. In President George Washington's words, his book was \"working a wonderful change in the minds of many men.\" Advertisement To Paine, independence represented an opportunity to re-create the world. It was a chance to get rid of the old, and make way for the new. In his own words, [W]e have every opportunity and every encouragement before us, to form the noblest, purest Constitution on the face of the earth. We have it in our power to begin the world over again... The birthday of a new world is at hand. Six months later, on July 4th, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was ratified. Another seven years later, the Treaty of Paris in 1783 established peace between the United States and Great Britain. Advertisement A revolution or innovation can only be called in hindsight. Before it materializes as such, it needs to overcome a wall of resistance. The Arab Spring, which began in Tunisia and later spread to Egypt, was quickly hailed as a successful movement across the Middle East toward democratization. Today we know it was not that easy. The truth is the status quo is persistent. It takes a long time for old structures to fall apart, and new ones to reign in. There are too many profiting from the status quo. Advertisement When Alexander Graham Bell, for example, the inventor of the telephone, tried to sell his invention and patents, he was rejected. Western Union rejected the offer because they did \"not see that this device will ever be capable of sending recognizable speech over a distance of several miles.\" The offer, therefore, was considered as \"utterly unreasonable, since this device is inherently of no use to us.\" Eventually though the telephone replaced the telegraph. Something that Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter would denote as \"creative destruction.\" Advertisement When American journalist Walt Mossberg asked Steve Jobs at the D8 conference in 2010, about the future of the tablet, Jobs made an analogy , \"When we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks, because that's what you needed on the farm. But as vehicles started to be used in the urban centers, cars got more popular.\" Then he paused, looked at Walt, and firmly said, \"PCs are going to be like trucks. They're still going to be around, they're still going to have a lot of value, but they're going to be used by one out of X people.\" Advertisement Today tablets ship in higher volumes than mobile PCs and the trend is set to continue. This, however, was not so obvious when Jobs introduced the iPad in 2010. The product polarized. When Bill Gates was asked about what he thought of the iPad, he said, You know, I'm a big believer in touch and digital reading, but I still think that some mixture of voice, the pen and a real keyboard -- in other words a netbook -- will be the mainstream on that... It's a nice reader, but there's nothing on the iPad I look at and say, 'Oh, I wish Microsoft had done it.' As venture capitalist Ben Horowitz points out, \"the trouble with innovation is that truly innovative ideas often look like bad ideas at the time. That's why they are innovative -- until now, nobody ever figured out that they were good ideas.\" Advertisement Innovation in the automobile industry has stalled for decades. There have been incremental improvements, but few disruptions. When Tesla Motors brought its shares to the NASDAQ on June 29, 2010, it was the first American car maker since Ford Motor Co. went public in 1956. Gasoline cars are pervasive. They have taken us a long way to where we are. Over the last century one American car maker, General Motors, turned out over 400 million gasoline cars and trucks. But they are the \"trucks\" in Jobs's analogy. They represent the status quo. Electric vehicles represent the challenge to the status quo. For a long time they were seen as \"slow and ugly, with low range, like a golf cart.\" But that perception is changing, thanks to Tesla and Elon Musk. Advertisement The history of the electric car begins in the 19th century. The first electric car was built in the United States in 1891 by William Morrison. By 1897, New York taxis got electrified by the Electric Carriage and Wagon Company of Philadelphia. The Hartford Electric Light Company proposed a recharging infrastructure as early as 1896. It sought to remedy the range issues of electric cars. The consumer would buy the vehicle without a battery through GVC, a subsidiary of General Electric and Hartford provided the electricity. At the turn of the century, the electric car was so popular that more than one third of all vehicles were powered by electricity. The New York Times acknowledged the \"great advances\" that the electric vehicle had made and hailed its \"quiet operation\" as a great advantage. Advertisement And then it all stopped. By the 1920s, America had developed a better system of infrastructure. This meant that vehicles needed to go longer distances. The discovery of large petroleum reserves had reduced the price of gasoline. This made the gasoline car more attractive to consumers. Henry Ford introduced the Model T in 1908 for $850. The popular equivalent by Anderson Electric cost more than twice as much. By 1915, Ford had cut the price almost by half, thus making the gasoline car more affordable to ordinary people. The gasoline car had won the battle, for now and the rest of the 20th century. What led to the decline of the electric car? 1. Cost and speed 2. Inconvenience in recharging 3. Short range Just three years into the new century, in 2003, Tesla, a technology and design start-up led by Elon Musk, staged the renaissance of the electric car. The purpose, in Musk's words, is \"to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution.\" Advertisement The strategy of the company was to enter the high end market, \"where customers are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower prices with each successive model.\" The master plan, that Musk shared in one of his early blog posts, therefore, included to: 1. Build a sports car. 2. Use that money to build an affordable car. 3. Use that money to build an even more affordable car. 4. While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options. In order to execute on that plan, Tesla had to overcome many barriers, obstacles and resistance. But Musk and his team pragmatically found a way to get from here to there. At nearly every turn they proved the critics wrong. Advertisement Even Bob Lutz, former chairman of General Motors, and staunch opponent of the electric car when Tesla launched, said that he owed them \"a debt of gratitude for having broken the ice.\" When legendary investor Warren Buffett was asked by students what he thought of the peak oil theory, he said that he believed that in twenty years all cars on the road will be electric. Today, in terms of cost and speed, gasoline cars have little to no competitive edge over electric cars. Electric vehicles are much more affordable than they have been historically. There may not be a compelling electric car for the masses yet, but if you study Musk's master plan, you will notice that this is in the making. Advertisement Is it still inconvenient to recharge your electric vehicle? Not really. Meanwhile gasoline car owners spend thousands of dollars and hundreds of minutes every year at the gas station. The average electric car owner will charge their electric cars at home overnight. They just don't drive that much on a daily basis. There is even a solution for frequent travelers. It's called Supercharger. If you currently own a Model S, you can travel for free across North America and Europe using the Supercharger network. In twenty minutes you can charge half of your car's battery. This is just the beginning. With Tesla opening up its patents, this may be the solution for an industry standard for charging stations. Instead of going to the gas station, drivers of the future will charge cars as people charge smartphones today. Advertisement It may not be feasible for everyone to switch to an electric car given the constraints today. But over time as these constraints will be removed, it will make less sense to choose a gasoline over an electric car. Electric cars don't impose the externalities that gasoline cars do. They don't have the operating costs of gasoline vehicles. That means no smog check or oil changes. Leading electric car vehicles such as the Model S are among the safest cars in the world. The Model S has been awarded the best safety reading from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That is the best rating of any car that has ever been tested in history. Advertisement When the Model X was unveiled, Musk said that the Model S can be seen as a platform as much as a vehicle. This enables Tesla to \"create many cars and bring other cars to market fast.\" When Jobs finished his analogy in his conversation with Mossberg, he began to smile. Being aware of the transformation that was undergoing, he understood that there was no point in resisting it. The only way was to embrace it. But he said, \"This transformation is going to make some people uneasy... when it really starts to happen, I think it's uncomfortable for a lot of people because its change.\" Advertisement The transformation toward a solar electric economy will also be uncomfortable. There will be a lot of people at unease. But as much as we want to fight it, embracing change is the only smart thing to do. William Gibson pointed out, that the future is already here, but it is just not evenly distributed yet. The future of electric cars may be here, but the road toward its completion is still long. In the meantime, gasoline cars will be around. They will offer value to society.

The World Of Science Has A Lot To Look Forward To In 2016 The conquest of space is just getting started. By Rahel Gebreyes Editor, HuffPost Video Jan 7, 2016, 04:14 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT After last year brought a number of scientific breakthroughs , 2016 is already shaping up to be another great year for science. It all starts on Jan. 17, when the Comet Catalina will reach its closest point to Earth -- roughly 68 million miles away -- and will even be visible to the naked eye . Advertisement Then, in March, astronauts Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko will return from the longest continuous stay on board the International Space Station. NASA scientists plan to test how space flight affects the human body and compare Kelly's body to that of his genetically identical twin brother. Near the end of the year, the Sierra Nevada Corporation is scheduled to launch the privately funded Dream Chaser in November. The spacecraft will be launched on the back of a rocket into suborbital space before coming back to Earth and landing horizontally on a runway.

China Marks Another Milestone In Quest To Become Space Superpower It's the first time a rocket designed by a Chinese private company has successfully entered orbit. Reuters May 17, 2018, 05:33 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING BEIJING (Reuters) - China launched its first privately developed rocket from a launchpad in northwestern China on Thursday, state media said, the latest milestone in the country\u2019s ambitious space exploration program. Since coming to office in 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has made becoming a \u201cspace flight superpower\u201d a top priority for the Chinese government, which has a goal of sending a permanent manned space station into orbit by around 2022. Advertisement The launch of the \u201cChongqing Liangjiang Star\u201d rocket, developed by OneSpace Technology, a Beijing-based private firm, marks the first time a non-state Chinese rocket has successfully entered orbit, the official Xinhua news agency said. The rocket is powered by a solid fuel engine developed by OneSpace and its control systems are customizable in accordance with user demand, the company\u2019s chairman, Ma Chao, told Xinhua. Also known as the OS-XO, the craft can place a 100-kilogram load into orbit 800 kilometers from the earth, according to state media. Advertisement The rocket uses energy-saving technology, such as wireless communications instead of wired internet that by cutting weight has helped lower fuel costs by about 30 percent, Xinhua said. Founded in 2015, OneSpace is the result of a government effort to foster China\u2019s commercial space flight and encourage private participation in the sector, according to state media. The company expects 10 missions for carrier rockets in 2019, founder Shu Chang told the official China Daily last week. Advertisement \u201cI hope we can become one of the biggest small-satellite launchers in the world,\u201d Shu said. Last year, the company signed a deal with the state-run Chongqing Liangjiang Aviation Industry Investment Group to build a joint research and manufacturing base in the southwestern city of Chongqing. The base\u2019s strategic location as part of China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative, a key foreign policy initiative by Xi that aims to develop trade links between China and Eurasia, will provide a large export market for OneSpace, Shu told China Daily. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

New Horizons Won't Be The Only Spacecraft At Our Solar System's Edge New Horizons Won't Be The Only Spacecraft At Our Solar System's Edge By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 19, 2015, 08:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Artist's impression of the New Horizons spacecraft encountering a Kuiper Belt Object, as part of an extended mission after the Pluto flyby. In 2014, using the Hubble Space Telescope, New Horizons science team members discovered three Kuiper Belt Objects. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute (JHUAPL/SwRI) Now that it's sailed beyond Pluto, what comes next for NASA' s New Horizons spacecraft? NASA says the probe will continue its mission into the Kuiper Belt , the vast region of primordial debris that encircles our solar system . It will be lonely out there for sure. But maybe not as lonely as you might imagine. As McClatchy D.C. reported, the New Horizons probe won't be the only spacecraft at our solar system's edge -- it will be joining four other unmanned spacecraft that are already speeding their way out of the solar system: Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , Voyager 1 , and Voyager 2 . Advertisement (Story continues below images.) MOUNTAIN VIEW, UNITED STATES: This is an artist rendition of the Pioneer 10 spacecraft as it passes the planet Jupiter. Today, marks the end of the United Sates' longest running space program which began over twenty-five years ago as NASA Ames Research Center received the last data transmision 31 March in Mountain View, California. JOHN G. MABANGLO/AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read JOHN G. MABANGLO/AFP/Getty Images) AFP/Getty Images The venerable Pioneer 10 spacecraft was launched in 1972 to explore Jupiter. It sent its last signal to Earth in 2003. The Pioneer 11 spacecraft undergoes tests before being transported to the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., March 29, 1973. Payload is to be launched Thursday night on a 22-month trip across space to probe the planet Jupiter. A twin, Pioneer 10, was launched 13 months ago and is scheduled to fly near Jupiter in December. (AP Photo/NASA) ASSOCIATED PRESS Advertisement The Pioneer 11 spacecraft was launched in 1973 to explore Saturn. It sent its last signal to Earth in 1995.

Voyager 1 and its identical sister craft Voyager 2 were launched in 1977 to study the outer Solar System and eventually interstellar space. (Photo by NASA/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Getty Images The Voyager 2 spacecraft, which launched in 1977, also continues to transmit data back to Earth. While in the Kuiper Belt, New Horizons will examine celestial objects found in the region until it runs out of fuel, the Guardian reported. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By that point it will be roughly 9.3 billion miles from the sun--and will continue on its way even after it falls silent. Onward all!

Our Badass Solar System Stole A Planet... Maybe Planet 9 remains a mystery, but this is one attempt to explain it. By Jenna Amatulli Reporter, HuffPost Jun 1, 2016, 03:46 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A rendering shows the view from Planet 9 toward the sun. A new theory tries to explain where this potential planet came from. Hurt/Caltech/IPAC/Handout via Reuters There's an alien in our midst. An alien planet, that is. A new theory published this week suggests that the much-debated \"Planet 9\" isn't just a new member of our solar system, but rather an exoplanet. There is evidence that Planet 9 -- if it exists -- was kidnapped by the sun from its original host star. As indicated by a new computer simulation developed by astronomers at Lund University in Sweden, our sun may have pulled the exoplanet from its host star as the two passed each other. Advertisement \"Planet 9 may very well have been 'shoved' by other planets, and when it ended up in an orbit that was too wide around its own star, our sun may have taken the opportunity to steal and capture Planet 9 from its original star,\" researcher Alexander Mustill said in a news release . \"When the sun later departed from the stellar cluster in which it was born, Planet 9 was stuck in an orbit around the sun.\" Earlier this year, researchers discovered the presence of a ninth planet by studying the orbits of icy objects beyond Neptune. They noticed anomalies in the objects' orbits and tracked them -- leading them to the gravitational pull of Planet 9. Advertisement The existence of Planet 9 is still unproved, and images have \" remained elusive .\" But astronomers haven't been twiddling their thumbs. They have come up with a few hypotheses for what the planet may look like. There's much more work to be done to figure out if this is just a theory or the real deal. So, until we know for sure, we'll just keep thinking our solar system is a master thief.

Male Birth Control Working On Rabbits, Humans Are Next Injections and birth control pills are completely blocking the flow of sperm in trials. By Andy Campbell Senior Editor, HuffPost Mar 30, 2016, 01:13 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT \u2022 Vasalgel, a reversible injection, blocked sperm in pre-clinical trials in rabbits. \u2022 Male birth control pills have shown efficacy in animals. \u2022 We\u2019re closer to viable male birth control, but a human version is still years away. Male birth control may be years out, but there are pills and injections in the works that are already stopping the flow of sperm in trials. These new methods tout all the orgasm without all the mess (and babies). Advertisement Several outlets are hailing Vasalgel , a reversible form of birth control that blocks the flow of sperm after being injected into the vas deferens , the duct that brings sperm from the testes to the urethra. But it's way too early to celebrate -- the polymer injection is in pre-clinical trials and has only been successfully administered to 12 rabbits. Still, the results, released on Tuesday , are promising. Vasalgel is meant to serve as an easily reversible replacement for vasectomy. Rather than severing the vas deferens, as doctors do for vasectomy, Vasagel would be injected to create a gel barrier for sperm. (Vasalgel appears to have no effect on orgasm or ejaculation, and even though sperm is blocked, seminal fluids can still be released.) When a man wants to reverse the process, a second injection would dissolve the polymer and open the vas deferens for business. Advertisement Parsemus Foundation Clinical trials in humans should take place later this year, according to a press release by the Parsemus Foundation, which developed the contraceptive. It's not yet clear how long the first injection will last, though it worked for a year in rabbits. \"We expect [that time frame] to be similar in men, but that is just a minimum,\" Elaine Lissner, executive director of the Parsemus Foundation, told Cosmopolitan . \"It seems to be pretty durable; we expect it to last for years. We just don't know how many yet.\" Advertisement In the United Kingdom, the future of male birth control may lie in the \"clean sheets pill,\" a non-hormonal contraceptive that inhibits the release of semen altogether by contracting muscles and putting a clamp on the vas deferens, The Guardian reports. The pill has also been tested only in animals, and experts say we need more clinical studies on these products in the United States. \"We may be years away from viable new options for male birth control, but we are moving in that direction,\" said Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt , co-director of The Personalized Urology & Robotics (PUR) Clinic at South Lake Hospital in Florida, who wrote about male contraceptives for Live Science. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The idea and the products will eventually find their way to the United States, provided they are alluring enough to investors and attractive enough to a large number of men,\" he said.

Neil DeGrasse Tyson Reveals How Schools Can Improve Their Science Teaching \"At no time are you actually trained how to think, how to analyze.\" By Kira Brekke Editor, HuffPost Video Jun 1, 2016, 05:09 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING If anyone knows how to make science more fun and engaging, it's astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. In a recent conversation with The Huffington Post's Impact & Innovation managing editor, David Freeman, Tyson addressed a question about how science courses in U.S. schools are lacking. The education system, he said, is too focused on getting students to memorize information they'll likely forget instead of teaching them analytical skills. \"We think of education all too often as, a student walks into a classroom with an empty mind and then you pour stuff into the head, and now they're educated,\" he said. \"And at no time are you actually trained how to think, how to analyze, how to process information, how to judge information.\" Advertisement Listen to Tyson's ideas for effective science education in the video above.

Ancient Fossil Of Bizarre Pig-Snouted Turtle Unearthed In Utah \"It\u2019s one of the weirdest turtles that ever lived.\" By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Oct 23, 2015, 03:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT World, meet Arvinachelys goldeni -- a bizarre pig-snouted turtle that lived about 76 million years ago. A fossil of the now-extinct creature was recently unearthed in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Kanab, Utah . \"It\u2019s one of the weirdest turtles that ever lived,\" said Joshua Lively, who described the new species in a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology this week. Advertisement An artist\u2019s depiction of the turtle Arvinachelys goldeni. Researchers say the creature is unlike any other known turtle. Victor Leshyk The reptile is said to be \"unlike any turtle ever found.\" While all other known turtle species have just one external nasal opening in their skulls, with a fleshy division between the nostrils, the broad snout of the Arvinachelys goldeni has two bony nasal openings. \"I've seen a lot of turtle skulls, and my initial impression was that looked very different that any other turtle skull I've seen,\" Lively, who studied the fossil as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Utah, told USA Today. \" It was bizarre .\" Advertisement Snout view of the skull of the fossil turtle Arvinachelys goldeni with its shell in the background. Natural History Museum of Utah The pig-nosed turtle -- whose scientific name derives from arvina , a Latin word for pig fat -- is believed to have gone extinct about 42 to 45 million years ago. The animal lived alongside tyrannosaurs, armored ankylosaurs, and giant duck-billed dinosaurs such as Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus, according to a University of Utah news release. Advertisement The creature, which measures about two feet from head to tail, lived in an era known as the Cretaceous Period, when southern Utah is said to have looked more like Louisiana with a great many rivers, and a wet and hot climate. As Discovery News notes, the unique fossil may provide scientists crucial insight into turtle evolution . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

While fossils of ancient turtle species have tended to be very incomplete, the pig-nosed specimen includes not only skull and shell, but also a nearly complete forelimb, partial hindlimbs, and vertebrae from the neck and tail. Advertisement \"With only isolated skulls or shells, we are unable to fully understand how different species of fossil turtles are related, and what roles they played in their ecosystems,\" said Randall Irmis, associate professor at the University of Utah, per the release.
