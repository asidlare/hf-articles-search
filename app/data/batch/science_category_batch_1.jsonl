LEAVE A COMMENT THE POWER OF STORIES IN THE 21st CENTURY CC0 public domain It says a lot about my family that my big, fun invitation for Memorial Day weekend was to the Narrating Science conference , \u201cThe Power of Stories in the 21st Century\u201d. Together Dad, me, sibling, Mom, and spouse spell STEAM which adds art \u2013 particularly design \u2013 to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics acronym (also a zoologist, Mom doubles for science/art depending upon one\u2019s nerdy needs). I am geeky enough to have posed four of us as STEM during a Hawaiian vacation. We like thinking and especially having time to sit and think and explore new perspectives; it seems like such a luxury. So, yes, an invitation to a Fiction meets Science conference was well received. Don\u2019t worry, friends; I know it is better to invite most of you to a weekend in Vegas. Advertisement Father and husband at home, I honestly expected the other two of our TEA to abandon parts of the conference in order to tour Toronto. Instead we three sat in a snug thank-gawd-it\u2019s-a-windowful room taking diligent notes and discussing the presentations long into the evening. From the influence of Roots on human origin stories (Josie Gill) to South Park \u2019s use of science to illuminate moral hypocrisy (Edward Bankes) to David A. Kirby\u2019s controversial stance that the film Hidden Figures was about discrimination, not about science, and could therefore have followed Black women lawyers and told the same story (absolutely not!), it became clear to me that the conference was ultimately about the power of alternative facts. Stories \u2013 whether motion picture or text \u2013 are product not only of their modes of production but also what audiences want to see. How else does someone read The Hunger Games novel\u2019s description of the character Rue including her \u201cthick dark hair\u201d and \u201cdark satiny brown skin\u201d and still picture a \u201clittle blonde innocent girl\u201d until the movie comes out (and because Rue\u2019s Black, \u201cher death wasn\u2019t as sad\u201d )? How else do audiences watch a film like Hidden Figures and celebrate the fictional desegregation of Jim Crow bathrooms by the composite (i.e., fabricated) White character Al Harrison when the real Katherine Johnson desegregated NASA bathrooms herself ? Frankly, how else do audiences dub Hidden Figures a \u201c feel good movie \u201d when it ends with genius Black women who were more highly skilled than the White people around them taking one step up a skyscraper length ladder and remaining employed far beneath their aptitude and out of the public discourse for half a century? Advertisement The GD-IQ would more accurately tabulate the stats, but audiences might also feel dejected by White males garnering the lion\u2019s share of speaking and screen time over the Black women who in theory lead the film, leveling another challenge to the revelries. Audiences ignore most of these contexts in order to focus on what they want to see: a film about Black women scientists and their extraordinary contributions to space exploration. Certainly that narrative predominates the headlines, but the rest becomes part of audiences, too. Narrating Science touched on how stories open us to absorbing their components as truth because they lower our resistance to persuasion (Matteo Farinella). While a viewer may protest that anything outside of the pride in NASA\u2019s Black women \u201chuman computers\u201d does not impact the takeaways, what becomes truth for that viewer is the elevation of White heroes , the idea that any gains by Black people are because of White people, that we all should focus on small steps, that those are good enough, and that the big picture is rightfully ignored. We want to feel affirmed . That is the one goal we humans have in common. We want that feeling so badly we put blinders on ourselves. Humans can\u2019t get it together enough to end light pollution \u2013 an easy fix if ever there were one (Cynthia Tarr) \u2013 but we ignore our ineptitude at that simple task and convince ourselves that people will overcome the horrors that are already befalling us from climate change . The window to avoid catastrophic climate change closed , and yet we continue to tell lies so that we feel better, more aligned with what we want reality to be. We won\u2019t be better, but we will perish feeling more resolved. Advertisement How do we overcome our craving for alternative facts? This question was asked in multiple forms during the conference. One presenter wondered how to convince certain populations of scientists of the obvious: that the ways they set up their experiments shape the results (Priscilla Wald). Another wondered how to persuade people that accidents are inevitable, that the ways in which we gravitate toward blaming human error reject the certainty of, e.g., nuclear meltdown (David K. Hecht). I comment in simpler terms: just because you get pregnant, it does not mean that birth control pills aren\u2019t 91% effective ; you just happen to be the one in eleven. However, most humans resist such reflection. Therein lies the appeal of science. It probes why anyone should be able to patent cells, genes, and organisms above and beyond whether HeLa cells should profit Henrietta Lacks\u2019s survivors. It considers the commercialization of virtual reality and the frankly predictable increase in mental health issues in the general population of consumers (particularly gamers addicted to first person shooters). It should also ask why at an international conference on the power of stories in the 21st century, the overwhelming majority of participants are fair skinned (my mother being the only attendee of darker complexion) while serving staff are dark including one who is studying microbiology. I do not catch his last name. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I suspect many at the conference find themselves in the same position I am in, focusing much of observation, research, and/or activism on the trees and neglecting the forest. In a world of alternative facts, the latter is overwhelming. Truth: we give more power and income to those who make us feel a certain way than to those who do the heavy lifting of what we actually need to live. We compensate celebrities of acting, sport, and music more than those who harvest our food, than those who keep our immediate environments sanitary. Educators and civil rights attorneys enjoy far less celebration and income for their contributions than that spokesperson who sells you product in a series of 30 second spots. I should know. I have been all three and was never paid as much nor received as many fanatical accolades as for selling strangers things they don\u2019t actually need in short television ads. Advertisement Joan Haran emphasized the role of hope in speculative science, but that hope is expansive. We revere those who make us feel as we wish, who affirm what we want to believe is true. Of course, we as consequence then rebuff those who pull our blinders off. We reject truth in favor of more affirming alternatives. We need to see.

Scientists Take Big Step Toward Being Able To Repair Brain Injuries They\u2019ve successfully completed a neuron transplant in mice. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Oct 28, 2016, 03:48 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Embryonic neurons (shown in red) transplanted into the adult mouse brain connect with host neurons (shown in black), rebuilding neural circuits previously lost due to an injury. Sofia Grade Scientists have long been working toward a day when a traumatic injury or stroke doesn\u2019t cause brain cells to be permanently lost. Executing this extremely difficult task would involve figuring out how to transplant new neurons into brain tissue. But neurons form precise connections with each other, and are guided by physiological signals that are active during early brain development \u2015 meaning that you can\u2019t sow a fistful of new neurons into mature brain tissue and expect them to grow the way they should. Advertisement But scientists are making progress. Embryonic neurons transplanted into the damaged brain of mice formed proper connections with their neighbors and restored function, researchers wrote in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature . By the fourth week, the transplanted young cells became the type of cells normally seen in that area of the brain. They were functional and responded to visual signals from the eyes. Moreover, the cells didn\u2019t develop aberrant connections, something that could lead to epileptic seizures. \u201cWhat we did there is proof of concept,\u201d said neuroscientist Magdalena G\u00f6tz of Ludwig-Maximilians University and the Institute of Stem Cell Research at the Helmholtz Center in Munich, Germany. Advertisement \u201cWe took the best type of neurons, chosen at a specific time, and then we put them in the lesioned brain,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was to find out how well can it work.\u201d The finding is an important step forward for someday repairing brain injury by using replacement neurons, other researchers said. Still, there are many challenges left. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this study,\u201d said Sunil Gandhi of University of California, Irvine, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research. \u201cThis is evidence that the brain can accept the addition of new neurons, which normally doesn\u2019t happen. That\u2019s very exciting for its potential for cell-based repair for brain.\u201d Advertisement Transplanted cells formed long-range connections with thalamic cells (shown in black). Sofia Grade But with complicated human biology comes complicated questions. What if the new cells become cancerous? What if the trauma of brain surgery causes more harm than the good a transplant might bring? \u201cIn the case of stroke, there are therapeutic avenues that involve behavioral rehabilitation that can help to some degree,\u201d Gandhi said. \u201cIt is true that the options are limited and frustrating. But the alternative is that we may end up going too fast and have unwanted harmful side effects.\u201d Advertisement Neuroscientist Zhiping Pang, of Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, agreed. \u201cThis is absolutely an interesting and exciting paper,\u201d he said. \u201cNevertheless, translating this to human stroke patients, safety will be a concern. A lot more work needs to be done, like the current study, before we can realize this exciting cell-replacement strategy in restoring proper brain functions of a stroke patient.\u201d The new study is promising, G\u00f6tz said, but acknowledged that things are a lot messier outside the lab. Injuries to the brain are not clean-cut. They can occur in various sites, involve different types of neurons, and are accompanied by inflammation and other meddling signals. But G\u00f6tz is hopeful that these problems can be solved. \u201cWe are doing this now in more realistic models, in models of traumatic and ischemic brain injury and all I can say is that it looks pretty good,\u201d she said. Advertisement Another challenge is to account for glial cells in the brain, which form scar tissue when an injury happens. That\u2019s why G\u00f6tz and her team are exploring the potential for turning these glial cells into new neurons that can replace the lost ones. That approach could also solve the problem of supply, as u sing cells from fetuses is not a practical option for human patients. Some forms of neuron transplantation have been done before. People with Parkinson\u2019s disease suffer from a death of dopamine-producing cells deep in the brain, and it\u2019s possible to transplant into their brains new neurons that secrete dopamine and help with certain symptoms. These neurons, however, don\u2019t need to become a part of the existing circuitry. They don\u2019t even need to be human cells \u2015 the first transplant of this kind was done using brain cells from pigs. Advertisement Other groups have turned to induced pluripotent stem cells, or adults cells \u2015 from a patient\u2019s skin, for example \u2015 that can be reprogrammed to an embryonic state and then directed to grow into a desired type of neuron. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be important now is to demonstrate that neurons that are grown from pluripotent stem cells can be coaxed to wiring up into the brain,\u201d Gandhi said.

Why Weed Gives You The Munchies, Explained By Neuroscience The Neuroscience Of Marijuana Munchies By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 24, 2015, 07:50 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Teenage Boy (15-17) Eating Pizza, Close-Up Getting high tends to make the prospect of a late-night snack (or a second dinner) suddenly very appealing. But why? According to neuroscientists at Yale School of Medicine , marijuana seems to highjack neurons in the brain that are normally geared toward suppressing appetite. Advertisement In a study on mice, the researchers observed how the appetite centers of the brain respond to marijuana -- and what they observed wasn't what they were expecting. The researchers manipulated brain processes which lead to eating by manipulating pathways that are involved in the way marijuana affects the brain. Then, by observing the way that the brain's appetite centers responded to cannabis, they were able to see what drives the \"marijuana munchies.\" \"It's like pressing a car's brakes and accelerating instead,\" the study's lead author, Yale neuroscientist Dr. Tamas Horvath, said in a statement . \"We were surprised to find that the neurons we thought were responsible for shutting down eating, were suddenly being activated and promoting hunger, even when you are full. It fools the brain's central feeding system.\" Advertisement The activation of these neurons helps to explain why cannabis makes you feel hungry, even when you're not actually hungry. The findings could be beneficial for patients suffering from conditions that may cause appetite suppression, including cancer patients going through chemotherapy. One day, cannabis-based treatments may be used to stimulate appetite in these patients. Previous research conducted on mice has shed light on some other mechanisms behind marijuana's tendency to increase appetite. A study last year published in the journal Nature Neuroscience suggested that marijuana munchies are the result of a greater sensitivity to smells and flavors. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's What A Chimp Drum Solo Sounds Like Here's What A Chimp Drum Solo Sounds Like By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jun 23, 2015, 02:30 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It's definitely better than Nickelback. A new paper published in Scientific Reports analyzes the rhythmic stylings of a chimp named Barney -- and shows that chimps may be more musically inclined than we previously thought. Researchers at the Biomedical Primate Research Centre in the Netherlands recorded Barney banging on a barrel back in 2005, but a scientific analysis of his performance wasn't published until last week. At the time of the recording, Barney, a \"low-ranking\" chimp living in a group of five adult males, was 24 years old. Advertisement Here\u2019s a short clip of Barney\u2019s drumming, which the paper notes was not prompted by humans in any way: Though it\u2019s not unusual for chimpanzees to beat on objects or their own bodies in the wild, the paper notes that this behavior \u201chas, musically speaking, little in common with human drumming.\u201d That\u2019s because it's typically less rhythmic. According to the paper, an \u201cessential characteristic\u201d of human drumming is \u201cbeating at regularly spaced time intervals\u201d that \u201cmakes the occurrence of the next beat(s) predictable.\u201d Advertisement While he probably won\u2019t win a Grammy anytime soon, Barney does indeed hit his barrel at regular intervals. Analysis also showed that Barney\u2019s drumming had an average tempo of 257 beats per minute, which, according to the paper, is \u201cclose to human tempo for rhythmic music.\u201d Humans already know that chimps use drumming to express aggression or impress a mate. However, Barney\u2019s performance didn\u2019t appear to serve any specific purpose or communicate any particular message. That\u2019s similar to human drumming, which the paper notes does not need to have a \u201cparticular purpose or context.\u201d Advertisement Additionally, while most chimps' drumming lasts only a few seconds, the paper says, Barney\u2019s drum solo went on for around four minutes as he remained totally focused on the barrel. Researchers believe that their analysis of Barney\u2019s drumming could be the first piece of \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that there\u2019s an evolutionary link between the \u201cwild beating\u201d of chimpanzees and music performed by human beings. \u201cBarney\u2019s performance confirms that the chimpanzee, our closest relative, could indeed be capable of drumming like a human,\u201d the paper says.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Likely Nosedived Into The Ocean, Researchers Say Math Theory May Explain How MH370 Vanished Without A Trace By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jun 16, 2015, 06:08 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Besides the location of the plane itself, one of the biggest mysteries behind the March 2014 disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 is the lack of debris. Now, researchers believe they've figured out how a plane could crash in the ocean and quite literally vanish. Advertisement According to research published in Notices of the American Mathematical Society, the plane could disappear without a trace if it nosedived at or near a 90-degree angle. The wings would have snapped off and sunk, followed by the largely intact fuselage itself. \"The true final moments of MH370 are likely to remain a mystery until someday when its black box is finally recovered and decoded,\" Texas A&M University at Qatar mathematician Goong Chen , who led the study, said in a news release. \" But forensics strongly supports that MH370 plunged into the ocean in a nosedive .\" Chen and an interdisciplinary team of researchers from Texas A&M, Penn State, Virginia Tech, MIT and the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute simulated five possible scenarios to see if any would result in an undamaged plane that could then sink without leaving any surface debris. Advertisement Certain angles would cause immediate and catastrophic damage to a plane, as shown in both mathematical models as well as a terrifying real-life incident. The researchers point to this video of a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines flight hitting the water in 1996: (Story continues below video) There is another scenario that would allow for a plane to crash into the sea with little immediate damage, and that's a gliding water entry. That's how Capt. Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger safely brought US Airways Flight 1549 down in the Hudson River in 2009. Advertisement However, in this case, the waves of the Indian Ocean would ultimately cause damage to the plane and result in debris, the researchers wrote. Most other water crashes have resulted in widespread debris, such as the 3,500 pieces of floating debris found after the 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean. With no sign of debris from MH370, that leaves the nosedive scenario as the most likely possibility. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What elements must we have, what culture must we extend to promote a more responsive campus to bolster student success? The answer may be in the seemingly unrelated work of Australian architect and zoo director David Hancocks. In his 2002 book, A Different Nature , Hancocks explored the paradox of the modern zoo. We traditionally have taken animals that were meant to live and thrive in the wild and placed them on display at zoos for the purpose of study and our own entertainment. We take these animals that are meant to roam free in wide geographical expanses and house them in a controlled environment. Of course, this can go tragically wrong, as we were made aware in 2016 when a male gorilla was killed at a Cincinnati zoo to rescue a 3-year-old boy who fell into the gorilla\u2019s enclosure. Advertisement While we all acknowledge that universities are not zoos, there is kind of a parallel. Universities are an ecosystem in which our students, faculty and staff must interact, and if we do not provide the right environment for learning then our students can suffer the consequences. Hancocks recollects the time he and his fellow zoo professionals in the 1970s took an enormous chance and redesigned the Seattle Zoo in an effort to create a more natural and accessible zoo. Unlike the cold and sterile zoo enclosures of the past, Hancocks and his team developed an enclosure for the gorilla exhibit that looked familiar to their native Central African mountains. This was controversial because there was a general understanding among zoo advocates that giving these animals a more natural setting would bring out their violent nature. As these animals would be exposed to a more natural setting they would desire to be free and turn on their handlers and try to escape. Advertisement As the great experiment unfolded, the opposite happened. When exposed to a more ethical setting, the gorillas thrived. They became more active and formed tighter family groups. Incidents of gorilla violence against their human keepers plummeted. The result was Hancock\u2019s more ethical zoo that is emulated all over the world today. Universities are not zoos, at least not in the traditional sense \u2013 even if going to any student union on a given day the term \u201czoo\u201d may seem like an apt description to some. Higher education has been working under the assumption that the traditional model of college access and matriculation is the best way to engage and encourage student success. However, we are learning more and more that a traditional model of acceptance, classes and graduation does not work for many students. Advertisement While the value of a college education is evident there is still an ongoing debate on college for whom? On average, a college graduate will earn $800,000 more in their lifetime than those holding just a high school diploma. More importantly since the great recession of 2009, virtually every job created in the aftermath has been aimed at those with a college degree. But college, in and of itself, is not a panacea. The cost of college is still a major issue for many families and that seems to be rising. More and more students around the country are mortgaging their future income through student loans to pay for college. For the class of 2016 the national average college debt was $37,000. (At UCF, 44 percent of students graduate with no debt. Of those who do incur debt \u2013 including those who transferred to UCF carrying some student loans \u2013 the average is $22,000.) These factors, combined with a perception to some that college is not creating employable graduates, have led some to question the value of a college education. Advertisement But what are the answers and what are we supposed to do about it? The answer may be in changing the environment. The general model for higher education has been that students arrive to college and follow one single track in order to achieve their college dreams. But this model seems to be both outdated and inaccurate. It is not unusual for today\u2019s college students to attend two or three colleges before graduating. For the Florida Consortium of Metropolitan Research Universities (the University of Central Florida in Orlando, University of South Florida in Tampa, and Florida International University in Miami), more than 55 percent of the students transfer in from a two-year college, where most of them have already achieved an associate degree. With that in mind, the consortium is partnering with the Helios Education Foundation to investigate how to create a more accessible campus by working together to share ideas, design solutions and ensure success. An 18-month investigation is focusing on developing a strategic plan that is supportive of a networked approach to higher education that will challenge higher-education professionals and off-campus stakeholders to remember our ethical principles of \u201cstudents first.\u201d Advertisement Who knows what that will take but the goal is to provide access to higher education for more students who will incur less debt and graduate on time with a number of viable career options. A byproduct of this planning period could be a model for all universities to work together and become more in sync with each other. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How The Brain Performs 'Mental Time Travel' How The Brain Travels Back In Time By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 21, 2015, 10:59 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Summery pictures hanging from washing line using clothespins. In one important way, we are capable of traveling back in time. Through memory, we can return to childhood, go back to the moment we first fell in love or recall our first professional triumph. Vivid memories that call to mind an experience in deep sensory detail can seem to transport us back to another time and place. When we recall the particular bit of information we're looking for, we also recall many other surrounding details -- how we felt, what we were wearing, what came before and afterwards. Advertisement New research from neuroscientists at Vanderbilt University sheds light on how the brain performs this remarkable function. The researchers analyzed brain activity of individuals performing a memory recollection task in order to show what's going on when we come up with elaborate memories that feel so real that they take us back to a time in the past. They were able to use brain activity patterns to predict the order in which study participants recalled information that they had previously received. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that we understand what different brain regions are doing as we search through our memories,\u201d psychologist Dr. Sean Polyn, the study's lead author, said in a statement . \u201cDiseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and epilepsy are devastating to memory, and this information can help us develop treatments to preserve patients\u2019 memories and identify adverse effects that new psychotropic drugs may have on people\u2019s memory.\u201d Advertisement The Vanderbilt research team sought to determine how memories are encoded with different levels of vividness and detail. They investigated both \"high fidelity memories\" -- those that are very well-preserved in our minds, even years later -- as well as bits of information that are remembered, but in isolation, without surrounding details and sensory information. \"In everyday life, when you have an experience, your brain constructs this rich neural code representing the details of that experience. Later, if you think back to that experience, the brain attempts to reactivate that neural representation,\" Polyn explained in an email to The Huffington Post. \"Mental time travel is when the brain does a really good job reactivating that past state, which can feel like you are actually revisiting the experience, in your mind\u2019s eye. According to Polyn, if a person studies a list of items, and then searches their memory to try to report back those items in order, they'll often report a cluster of things that happened right around the moment of remembering that item, suggesting that their brain has mentally travelled back to that moment. Advertisement A brain region called the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been known to play a role in memory, largely because amnesia often results when this region is damaged. The researchers devised a model to show how structures within the MTL support the retrieval of memories. Finding that the anterior region of the MTL signals when the memory is being retrieved, but doesn't suggest how detailed the memory is. However, they found that the posterior region becomes active when a highly detailed memory is being recalled. \"We find that activity in the posterior medial temporal lobe allows us to predict when the person is going to have a \u2018mental time travel moment,\u2019 we can tell when they are about to report a cluster of memories for things that happened nearby in time,\" Polyn said. To test the model, fMRI scans were conducted on 20 participants between the ages of 18 and 35, while they were given a list of 24 names of common objects like 'horse' and 'boat.' After briefly concentrating on the words and then pausing, they were asked to recall the words they had just studied in the order the occurred. Advertisement The researchers found that when the participant's brain activity revealed that they had retrieved a memory with \"high fidelity,\" their next response was likely to be the next item on the list -- suggesting that they also recalled the detail around the object. But when they did not recall the item with high fidelity, the next item was often not the next one on the list, which suggests that the information was recalled in isolation. \u201cThis demonstrates that the brain stamps memories with a temporal code,\" Polyn said in the statement . \"These time-travel recollections allow the brain to retrieve that temporal code, which makes memories for nearby things more accessible, in this case the next item in the list.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Understanding what's happening in different brain regions when we're searching for memories may have some important implications for the study of memory-related disorders like Alzheimer's. Advertisement \"People with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia, often have difficulty remembering things that just happened to them,\" Polyn told HuffPost. \"A doctor could have a patient repeat back a series of numbers a few times, but then a few minutes later, the patient might not even remember that they even studied those things. If we can understand what different brain regions are doing during healthy memory retrieval, that can give us great insight into what\u2019s going wrong when memory is damaged. It may also help us develop better tests for early detection of memory disorders, and give us ideas for how to better treat people with these disorders.\" The study was published on February 18 in the Journal of Neuroscience .

LEAVE A COMMENT NASA/JPL/Handout via Reuters Elizabeth Tasker , Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has announced a mission to visit the two moons of Mars and return a rock sample to Earth. It\u2019s a plan to uncover both the mystery of the moons\u2019 creation and, perhaps, how life began in our Solar System. The Solar System\u2019s planets take their names from ancient Greek and Roman mythology. Mars is the god of war, while the red planet\u2019s two moons are named for the deity\u2019s twin sons: Deimos (meaning panic) and Phobos (fear). Advertisement Unlike our own Moon, Phobos and Deimos are tiny. Phobos has an average diameter of 22.2km, while Deimos measures an even smaller 13km. Neither moon is on a stable orbit, with Deimos slowly moving away from Mars while Phobos will hit the Martian surface in around 20 million years. The small size of the two satellites makes their gravity too weak to pull the moons in spheres. Instead, the pair have the irregular, lumpy structure of asteroids. This has led to a major question about their formation: were these moons formed from Mars or are they actually captured asteroids? Impact or capture? Our own Moon is thought to have formed when a Mars-sized object hit the early Earth. Material from the collision was flung into the Earth\u2019s orbit to coalesce into our Moon. Advertisement A similar event could have produced Phobos and Deimos. The terrestrial planets were subjected to a rain of impacts during the final throes of Solar System formation. Mars shows possible evidence of one such major impact, as the planet\u2019s northern hemisphere is sunk an average of 5.5km lower than the southern terrain. Debris from this or other impacts could have given birth to the moons. Alternatively, Phobos and Deimos could be asteroids that were scattered inwards from the asteroid belt by the looming gravitational influence of Jupiter. Snagged by Mars\u2019s gravity, the planet could have stolen its two moons. This mechanism is how Neptune acquired its moon , Triton, which is thought to have once been a Kuiper belt object, like Pluto. Advertisement There are compelling arguments for both the #TeamImpact and #TeamCapture scenario. The orbits of the two moons are circular and in the plane of Mars\u2019s own rotation. While the chance of this happening during a capture event are extremely low, observations of the moons suggest they may have a composition similar to that of other asteroids . Definite determination of the moons\u2019 composition would act as a fingerprint to distinguish the two models. A collision event should result in moons made from the same rock as Mars. But if the moons were captured, they would have formed in a different part of the Solar System with distinct minerals. This is where the new mission comes in. JAXA\u2019s Martian Moon eXploration Mission (MMX) is due to launch in September 2024 and arrive at Mars in August 2025. The spacecraft will then spend the next three years exploring the two moons and the environment around the red planet. Advertisement During this time, MMX will drop to the surface of Phobos and collect a sample to return to Earth in the summer of 2029. Due to their weak gravity, collecting a sample from small rocky bodies is a difficult challenge. But this is JAXA\u2019s speciality. The space agency has previously returned samples from asteroid Itokawa in 2010. The sequel to that mission, Hayabusa2 , is due to arrive at asteroid Ryugu next year. International collaborations The excitement for a Mars moon mission has led to strong international involvement in MMX. On April 10, JAXA president Naoki Okumura met his counterpart from France\u2019s Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales (CNES), Jean-Yves Le Gall. Advertisement The meeting cemented a collaboration between the two space agencies. CNES will provide an instrument for MMX as well as combining expertise on flight dynamics for the tricky encounter with the Martian moons. The French instrument will combine a high-resolution infrared camera and spectrometer, a technique that analyses the composition of each image pixel. This will allow the rocks of the Martian moons to be investigated down to a few tenths of a metre. With a pixel size an order of magnitude smaller than that of similar instruments on missions such as NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA\u2019s Mars Express, the spectrometer will also be able to help MMX select the best landing site on Phobos and take the sample. Advertisement CNES will also explore the possibility of building a rover to explore the surface of Phobos. A decision will be taken in November this year. In addition to the collaboration with France, MMX will carry an instrument from NASA. While the CNES spectrometer will examine the type of minerals on the moons, the NASA instrument will pick out individual chemical elements. This is done by analyzing the high-energy Gamma rays and neutrons that are produced during the bombardment of cosmic rays from the Sun or more distant sources. Together, these instruments will reveal a more thorough composition of Mars\u2019s mysterious satellites. Both #TeamCapture and #TeamImpact offer fantastic science. Moons formed from collisional debris would be preserved time capsules of conditions on the young Mars. In this early epoch, Mars and the Earth are expected to have been far more similar than now. A sample from this time could reveal how a planet becomes habitable. Advertisement But moons captured from the asteroid belt would be kin to the meteorites that rained down on the young Earth. These are thought to be the deliverers of our oceans and even our first organic molecules. A sample from Phobos would be a taste of the package that was flung around the early Solar System. Phobos\u2019s ever decreasing distance to Mars also means that the top layer of the moon\u2019s soil should be littered with meteorites scattered from the planet. Such a short journey would allow much lower-density material to survive the trip, unlike the Martian meteorites that manage to reach Earth. This transferred material will also be from all over Mars, rather than the small patch that rovers have examined. And it might result in a more complete picture of Mars, as well as of its moons. Advertisement MMX is an exciting mission, bringing information about moon formation, Mars and water delivery around our Sun. As we wait for 2024, are you voting for #TeamImpact or #TeamCapture?

Video Shows Stingray Giving Birth Inside Fishermen's Boat The mom and her dozen or so babies were later thrown back into the water. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Dec 27, 2015, 12:05 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Several fishermen got a little more than they bargained for when they reeled in a stingray that started giving birth inside their boat. Video of the astonishing delivery was recently uploaded to YouTube , showing at least a dozen slippery babies popping out of the stingray after some prodding by one of the fishermen. Advertisement Unfortunately for the mom, the men had already cut off her tail before realizing the creature was pregnant, according to Javier Capello, who uploaded the video. That move was likely because the tail's barbed stinger can be dangerous when used in self-defense. A stingray is seen giving birth to at least a dozen babies inside of some fishermen's boat. YouTube However, Capello claims that after the babies were delivered, all the animals -- including the mother -- were thrown back into the water. Advertisement \"Guiltiness was heavier than hunger,\" he wrote, adding that they all appear to have survived. \"Mom seemed pretty healthy when it swum off, and the sting (is) only a defense tool they don't need it to eat, so I guess they survived,\" Capello wrote. The remarkable birth comes just a couple weeks after a similar YouTube video showing a 12-year-old Australian boy assisting in another stingray's live birth. Miller Wilson counted at least eight babies exiting the massive stingray, which he named \"Big Mama.\" Perry Hampton, vice president of animal husbandry at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, warned against such \"dangerous and risky behavior\" in an interview with The Huffington Post when that video was posted. Advertisement \"It\u2019s never a good idea to handle wild animals,\" Hampton said. \"The act alone causes stress. This is something that is difficult to measure but it affects them negatively in many ways. Added to that is the way he is handling them by picking them up by their spiracles [breathing openings behind their eyes]. Comparing it to lifting us up by our nostrils is overstating it, but you get the point.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Amazing Egg Feat May Be Good News For Gay Couples, Infertile Women Scientists working with mice turn ordinary skin cells into viable eggs. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Oct 18, 2016, 12:41 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Mice born from egg cells that had been derived from skin cells. K. Hayashi/Kyushu University Imagine a world in which women without viable eggs are able to have babies using eggs created fresh from cells of their own skin. Or how about one in which two men can father their own biological child \u2015 one with DNA from both dads. We\u2019re not there yet, not by a long shot. But in what Nature magazine is calling a \u201ctour de force of reproductive biology,\u201d scientists in Japan have succeeded in turning mouse skin cells into mouse egg cells and then using the eggs to grow normal mouse pups. Advertisement \u201cIt is a tremendous advance ,\u201d Dr. Azim Surani, a University of Cambridge stem cell expert who was not involved in the research, told New Scientist. \u201cThe idea that you can start with a skin cell and make viable eggs in culture is quite amazing.\u201d Though previous research successfully used skin cells to make viable egg cells, the new process is significant because it was accomplished entirely within a lab dish , Scientific American reported. Previously, immature skin-derived eggs had to be implanted into a living mouse in order to mature fully \u2015 a more unwieldy process. To achieve their feat, researchers at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, took cells from the tails of female mice and turned them into stem cells \u2015 undifferentiated, embryonic-like cells that can become any cell type in the body \u2015 by treating them with a mixture of proteins and growth factors, The Wall Street Journal reported. Then they cultured the cells alongside mouse ovarian cells to produce the mature egg cells. Advertisement Mature egg cells that were derived from skin cells. K. Hayashi/Kyushu University To test whether eggs produced in this manner could yield offspring, the researchers fertilized them with mouse sperm and then implanted them in the uteruses of other mice. Only 1 percent of the cells led to live births, according to Scientific American. But the stem cell biologist who led the team of researchers, Dr. Katsuhiko Hayashi, said the resulting animals were healthy and fertile and lived a normal lifespan. The same basic process might ultimately be used to restore fertility to women rendered infertile by early menopause or chemotherapy treatments. It might also allow male couples to father \u201ctwo-father\u201d babies using eggs from male skin cells \u2015 though that might necessitate finding a way to remove the Y chromosome, Dr. Jacob Hanna, a stem cell researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, told New Scientist. Advertisement \u201cI get one email a day from same sex couples asking me about this,\u201d Hanna said, per New Scientist. But Hayashi cautioned that skin-cell-derived eggs might not be suitable for use as a fertility treatment because their low quality might yield abnormal offspring. And absent a breakthrough that \u201caccelerates the technology,\u201d he told The Huffington Post in an email, it might take 10 to 20 years to create human eggs using the process. Dr. Diana Laird, a developmental biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that clinical use of the technique \u2015 if it ever comes \u2015 would take some time. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want patients who have infertility to think this can be done in humans next year\u201d or any other time in the near future, she told Science News. Advertisement Even if the technical challenges are overcome, the technique raises big ethical questions. For one thing, it might be used to make so-called \u201c designer babies \u201d whose high intelligence or other beneficial traits might give them unfair advantages over other babies. And using the technology to create a child in any \u201cunusual way\u201d \u2015 including its use by male couples \u2015 would necessitate new regulatory oversight, Dr. Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University, told HuffPost. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

ESA Mars Lander Disappears In Descent To Red Planet The lander, sent to investigate Mars for signs of life, stopped transmitting as it neared the planet. Maria Sheahan Oct 19, 2016, 07:25 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING DARMSTADT, Germany - A European space lander reached Mars on Wednesday in what scientists hope will mark a major milestone in exploration of the Red Planet, but whether it touched down on the surface in good working condition was far from certain. Older European and U.S. spacecraft already in orbit relayed data of the lander\u2019s six-minute descent. Then the transmission stopped, leaving questions over what state the disc-shaped 577-kg (1,272 lb) Schiaparelli probe was in. Advertisement \u201cIt is clear that these are not good signs,\u201d said Paolo Ferri, the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) head of mission operations. However, the primary part of the mission, bringing the lander\u2019s mothership into orbit around Mars to search for signs of life, was a success, the agency said. \u201cTo fly to Mars is a very big challenge. To fly and be in safe orbit is a very big challenge,\u201d ESA Director General Jan Woerner said at ESA\u2019s Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Advertisement Schiaparelli, which is testing technologies for a rover due to follow in 2020, represents only the second European attempt to land a craft on the Red Planet. A Schiaparelli crash could impact plans for the 2020 rover, though that mission is now using a different type of landing system, ESA scientist Olivier Witasse said during a webcast press conference at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Pasadena, California. \u201cThe design of the system has changed over the last few years ... We will not reuse all the technology from Schiaparelli, so it will impact, but not dramatically, if there is a failure with Schiaparelli,\u201d Witasse said. Advertisement ESA said more information about Schiaparelli should be available on Thursday, when scientists have had a chance to analyze data from the orbiting craft. \u201cCross your fingers, we still have hope,\u201d Woerner said. Landing on Mars, currently some 35 million miles (56 million km) away from its nearest planetary neighbor Earth, is a notoriously difficult task that has thwarted a single previous effort by Europe, most of Russia\u2019s probes and given U.S. space agency NASA trouble as well. The planet\u2019s hostile environment has not detracted from its allure, with U.S. President Barack Obama recently highlighting his pledge to send people to the surface by the 2030s. Advertisement \u201cWith this mission we\u2019re laying the foundation for going there,\u201d astronaut Alexander Gerst, who is set to become the first German commander of the International Space Station in 2018, told Reuters TV. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is developing a massive rocket and capsule to transport large numbers of people and cargo to Mars with the ultimate goal of colonizing the planet, and the U.S. entrepreneur has said he would like to launch the first crew as early as 2024. SIGNS OF LIFE? The primary goal of ExoMars, the European-Russian program that launched Schiaparelli, is to find out whether life has ever existed on Mars. Advertisement The spacecraft on which the lander traveled, Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), carries an atmospheric probe to study trace gases such as methane around the planet. Scientists believe that methane, a chemical that on Earth is strongly tied to life, could stem from micro-organisms that either became extinct millions of years ago and left gas frozen below the planet\u2019s surface, or that some methane-producing organisms still survive. \u201cIf there is life in our solar system beyond Earth, then Mars is the most interesting planet,\u201d ESA\u2019s Woerner told Reuters TV. Advertisement The second part of the ExoMars mission, delayed to 2020 from 2018, will deliver a European rover to Mars. It will be the first with the ability to both move across the planet\u2019s surface and drill into the ground to collect and analyze samples. The ExoMars 2016 mission is led by the European Space Agency (ESA), with Russia\u2019s Roscosmos supplying the launcher and two of the four scientific instruments on the trace gas orbiter. The prime contractor is Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales TCFP.PA and Finmeccanica SIFI.MI. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Dec 26, 2015, 07:01 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Laurence Dutton via Getty Images As the New Horizons spacecraft made its historic flight to Pluto and some scientists explored the far reaches of our solar system, others were making some incredible advances in their exploration of the inner workings of the mind. Studies published this year shed light on the mysteries of the brain and human behavior, and began paving the way for new treatments to mental and neurological health problems, ranging from addiction to autism to Alzheimer's disease. Advertisement Here are eight fascinating things we learned about the human mind in 2015. 1. Smartphones are wildly distracting. Americans are spending more time than ever looking at screens, and we're only beginning to learn how this is affecting our brains . Just hearing your smartphone vibrate is enough of a distraction to significantly impair focus and productivity, according to a Florida State University study published in August. Another recent study found that heavy smartphone users are more prone to experiencing \"cognitive failures\" arising from forgetfulness, inattention and a lack of awareness of one's surroundings, including things like missing appointments, walking into people and forgetting things. Advertisement \"The Internet is great, mobile phones are great, but there is a point at which we need to sit back, log off and really start to think about how technology is impacting on our capacity to focus,\" said Dr. Lee Hadlington, a psychologist at England's De Montfort University and the latter study's lead author . \"We are always eager to get the new piece of tech -- but not to think about its underlying consequences to our cognitive capabilities.\" 2. Psychedelics may be the next big thing in mental health care. We witnessed a renaissance in psychedelic research this year. A review of studies on the therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs, published in September in the Canadian Medical Association Journal , showed that psychotherapy assisted by substances such as LSD, psilocybin (hallucinogenic mushrooms) and MDMA (the active ingredient in Ecstasy) holds promise for treating mental health issues including post-traumatic stress disorder , addiction , end-of-life anxiety and depression . \"The studies are showing big effects,\" Dr. Matthew Johnson, a behavioral pharmacologist at Johns Hopkins University and one of the study's authors, told HuffPost . \"The exciting thing isn't just that these drugs work for something that we already have treatment for. It's that they're getting big effects on disorders for which we have very poor treatment.\" Advertisement 3. Pollution is worse for the brain than we realized. Just months before the world looked on in horror at Beijing's \"airpocalypse ,\" research found that exposure to air pollution can speed up brain aging, and may contribute significantly to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The study showed that small increases in exposure to pollution were associated with decreases of white matter in the brain -- in other words, exposure to environmental toxins was \"shrinking\" the brain. \"The evidence so far suggests that pollution could be the most pervasive potential cause of brain disease that scientists have ever discovered,\" science journalist Aaron Reuben wrote in Mother Jones in May . Advertisement 4. The brain and immune system are actually linked. This year, University of Virginia neuroscientists uncovered a previously unknown direct connection between the brain and the immune system -- a network of lymphatic vessels that previously had only been found to exist below the base of the skull, but were observed for the first time in the brain. \"When we discovered the lymphatic vessels, we were very, very surprised, because based on the textbooks -- these vessels do not exist,\" the study's lead author, Dr. Jonathan Kipnis, told HuffPost in June. The finding could have significant implications for the treatment of brain disorders involving inflammation, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and autism. Advertisement 5. Erasing memories could be the future of addiction treatment. Scientists hacking into the brain to erase or transplant memories is no longer just the stuff of science fiction. Memory erasure may soon be a reality, and it could help us better treat drug addiction by targeting drug-related memories. Landmark research from the Scripps Research Institute that was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry identified a new drug that has the potential to selectively erase dangerous addiction-associated memories in people addicted to meth. \"When the person is in-patient, they'd use this treatment once and it would target those drug-associated memories that could be triggers for them,\" Dr. Courtney Miller, one of the study's authors, said in August. \"Later on, when they're back in the real world, the memories wouldn't serve as triggers because they'd be gone.\" Advertisement 6. Nature does the mind good. We already knew that spending time in the great outdoors comes with significant physical and mental health benefits, but this year, researchers found that the psychological benefits of nature extend even further than we realized. Research from Stanford University that was published in July found that outdoor strolls reduced the sort of obsessive, negative thoughts that characterize depression. Another study published last month found that spending time in nature could also have therapeutic applications for addiction, and linked exposure to nature with reduced impulsivity and improved self-control. Advertisement \"A nature-based treatment component may be a valuable addition to standard therapies for individuals struggling with substance abuse,\" Dr. Meredith Berry, a psychologist at the University of Montana and the study's lead author, told HuffPost . 7. To boost your mood, boost your bacteria. The brain-gut connection has been another major theme in neuroscience and psychology research over the past couple of years. This year, research found that increasing the balance of healthy bacteria in the gut can help to reduce anxiety and also to lessen symptoms of depression . One study showed that people who have more fermented foods in their diet -- which are filled with healthy bacteria known as probiotics -- exhibit less neuroticism and social anxiety. Advertisement \u201cIt is likely that the probiotics in the fermented foods are favorably changing the environment in the gut, and changes in the gut in turn influence social anxiety,\u201d Dr. Matthew Hilimire, an assistant professor of psychology and one of the study's authors, said in a statement in June . \u201cI think that it is absolutely fascinating that the microorganisms in your gut can influence your mind.\u201d 8. Good sleep is critical to a healthy emotional life. It's well-established that good sleep is crucial to psychological well-being -- and that sleep deprivation, on the other hand, raises stress levels and has been linked with anxiety , depression and other mental health problems. A landmark study published in July in the Journal of Neuroscience found that good sleep is also a key component of emotional intelligence. The researchers showed that losing sleep dulls our ability to read facial expressions, which is an important component of emotional intelligence. On the bright side, dreaming actually boosts this ability, the researchers found. Advertisement \"It's almost as though, without sleep, the brain... was unable to put emotional experiences into context and produce controlled, appropriate responses,\" Walker said in a statement when the study was published . \"Emotionally, you're not on a level playing field.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

A Typical Christmas Tree May Not Be What You Think If you think it's a pine, just watch this. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Dec 24, 2015, 02:55 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Christmas trees come in all shapes, sizes and species -- and most of them are pines, right? Wrong. The typical holiday tree is not of the genus Pinus , but rather a spruce or fir tree, according to a new video (above), from the popular YouTube channel MinuteEarth . \"Pines and the trees they get confused with, differ in the shape and size of their needles and cones, as well as their overall shape,\" says Henry Reich, the video's narrator. They are, however, members of the grand tree family Pinaceae . Advertisement Now you know.

New Octopus Is So Adorable It Might Be Named Opisthoteuthis Adorabilis New Octopus Is So Cute That 'Adorable' Might Become Part Of Its Name By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jun 16, 2015, 02:56 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The most adorable little octopus in the world looks like a cross between a Pac-Man ghost and a Pokemon creature. Just don't ask for its name because it doesn't have one yet. But the octopus is so cute that \"adorable\" might become part of its scientific identity. Advertisement \"As someone that's describing the species you get to pick what the specific name is,\" Stephanie Bush, postdoctoral fellow at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, who is working to describe the octopus, told Science Friday. \"One of the thoughts I had was making it Opisthoteuthis Adorabilis -- because they're really cute.\" As the possible name indicates, this rare cephalopod belongs to the Opisthoteuthis genus. That's the same genus as Pearl , the pink flapjack octopus (Opisthoteuthis californiana) in \"Finding Nemo.\" Specimens of this new octopus have been collected since 1990, but until now they have not yet been scientifically described. The wee octopus is known for the distinctive webbing between its tentacles, which allows it to float like a parachute while using the fins on its mantle to steer.

Comet Lander Philae Awakes From Hibernation Comet Lander Philae Awakes From Hibernation Associated Press Jun 14, 2015, 08:29 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT BERLIN (AP) \u2014 To scientists' relief and delight, the Philae spacecraft that landed on a comet last fall has woken up and communicated with Earth after seven long months of silence, the European Space Agency announced Sunday. Philae became the first spacecraft to settle on a comet when it touched down on icy 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in November. But the solar-powered probe came down with a bounce and ended up in the shadow of a cliff instead of in direct sunlight. Advertisement As a result, Philae managed to conduct experiments and send data to Earth for only about 60 hours before its batteries ran out and it was forced to shut down its systems and go silent. Scientists had hoped the probe would wake up again as the comet approached the sun, enabling Philae's solar panels to soak up enough light to charge the craft's main battery. But there were fears its mission would be cut short. Those fears were dismissed at 10:28 p.m. (2028 GMT; 4:28 p.m. EDT) on Saturday, when the lander sent a signal back to Earth. Advertisement \"I'm not really surprised it happened, but if you wait for several months and then suddenly in the middle of the night you get a call saying, 'We have a signal from Philae,' it's exciting,\" said Stephan Ulamec, project manager at the German Aerospace Center, or DLR. \"We're very happy.\" The brief burst of communication contained 300 packages of data that were relayed by the probe's mother ship, Rosetta, which is orbiting the comet. \"We only received data for about 85 seconds. These data are housekeeping and system data from the lander,\" Ulamec said. But it was enough to tell scientists that the probe is doing well and getting sufficient sunlight to keep communicating. Advertisement Ulamec said the probe appears to have been awake for several days before it called home. Scientists will now work to change Rosetta's orbit so that the link to the lander lasts longer and they can start sending commands for it to carry out new measurements. The next opportunity to communicate with Philae should come on Sunday night, Ulamec said. Scientists also hope that Philae's restart will allow them to pinpoint where on the 2.5-mile (4-kilometer)-wide comet the washing machine-size probe landed. Its exact location has been a mystery. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

On Aug. 13, the comet will reach the point at which it is closest to the sun before swinging back out again. Ulamec said the lander should get enough sunlight to operate until October, when it will once again fall silent, possibly forever.

'Significant' New Rift Could Sever Massive Iceberg From Antarctica An island of ice the size of Delaware is perilously close to breaking away. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost May 3, 2017, 08:54 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An image released by NASA in November of the rift in the Larsen C. NASA Earth Observatory Scientists have observed a new rift in Antarctica\u2019s Larsen C ice shelf that could soon lead to the calving of one of the biggest icebergs on record. A secondary branch has split off from a 100-mile-long crack in the ice shelf that\u2019s been growing since 2010, researchers with the United Kingdom-based Project MIDAS announced this month. Project MIDAS tracks the effects of climate change on the Larsen C . Advertisement That new rift, which is about 6 miles long, has forked toward the ice-front, or the region where the shelf meets the ocean. \u201cAs of May 1, 2017, we have observed a significant change in the rift on the Larsen C ice shelf,\u201d researchers with Project MIDAS wrote . \u201cWhile the previous rift tip has not advanced, a new branch of the rift has been initiated [approximately] 10km behind the previous tip, heading towards the ice-front. This is the first significant change to the rift since February of this year.\u201d Larsen C Ice Shelf rift update: No major advance since February, but #Sentinel1 InSAR shows the rift branched in the last 6 days @ESA_EO pic.twitter.com/7rhjcGjnKs \u2014 Adrian Luckman (@adrian_luckman) May 1, 2017 Advertisement The main crack drew attention earlier this year, when scientists said it had grown more than 10 miles over a few weeks in December and an additional 6 miles in the first three weeks of January. Adrian Luckman, the lead researcher behind the project, declared at the time that a calving would be \u201c inevitable .\u201d \u201cWhen it calves, the Larsen C Ice Shelf will lose more than 10 percent of its area to leave the ice front at its most retreated position ever recorded; this event will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. Scientists aren\u2019t exactly sure when the shelf will separate, Mashable notes. But Luckman said in January that he\u2019d be \u201camazed\u201d if it didn\u2019t break away in mere months, and rhetoric usually has a not-if-but-when tone. Advertisement Despite a lack in forward progress at the main rift, it has been steadily separating from the rest of the shelf by a few meters in width per day. The primary fork has currently reached an area of soft ice, called a suture zone , that has slowed its progress, according to the BBC. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Luckman told the outlet it\u2019s possible the new crack, which started branching about 6 miles behind the main fork, veered into a patch of more breakable ice as the shelf has slowly been wrenched apart. Advertisement \u201cBecause the rift tip was in this area of basically softer ice that is very difficult to fracture, then the stresses have been transferred elsewhere and something has given, i.e. it has fractured in some of the ice that is more vulnerable to breaking which happens to be about 10km further back than the current rift tip,\u201d Luckman said. MIDAS has said that when the section of the Larsen C breaks off, the rest of the ice shelf will be much more vulnerable to melting and could very well mirror what happened at its sister shelf, the Larsen B. That area \u201c splintered and collapsed \u201d over the course of a month in 2002, NASA said, causing almost the entire shelf to disappear. The agency noted it had never witnessed such a large area \u2015 1,250 square miles \u2015 disintegrate so quickly.

Cassini Preps For Death Plunge Into Saturn And Sends Farewell Image Of Tiny Earth The barely visible dot of our home could be perceived as an exoplanet from a faraway perspective. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Apr 28, 2017, 10:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An April 12 image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows Earth as a point of light between the icy rings of Saturn. Cassini was 870 million miles from Earth when the image was taken. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute As NASA\u2019s amazing Cassini spacecraft takes on technological death-defying feats months before it goes into a final plunge into Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, it continues to transmit images back to Earth of things never seen before so close to a giant planet. This week, Cassini flew through the relatively short 1,500-mile gap that separates Saturn\u2019s enormously intricate ring system from the top of the planet\u2019s atmosphere, transmitting precious data back to Earthbound scientists. Advertisement Cassini also this month beamed home \u2015 through Saturn\u2019s icy rings \u2015 a unique image of Earth , 870 million miles away, as seen above. That very tiny dot in space represents everything we are, our continents and oceans \u2015 everything about where we are in the cosmos. And if you need to strain your eyes to see both Earth and our moon, here\u2019s a zoomed-in version of us with the moon to our left: Advertisement In this zoomed-in image of the previous picture, the moon can be seen to the left of Earth. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute It offers an interesting perspective on our place in our little neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy. And while this is the most recent photograph of Earth from very far away, it\u2019s not the first and not necessarily the most dramatic. Advertisement We\u2019ve gathered some incredible images here to show how, from someone else\u2019s perspective \u2015 if they happen to live on a world that isn\u2019t part of our solar system and if their technology discovered us in the cosmos \u2015 they could easily refer to Earth as, well, an exoplanet. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Ancient Cannabis 'Burial Shroud' Discovered In Desert Oasis For the first time, archaeologists have unearthed well-preserved cannabis plants, which were placed on a corpse some 2,500 years ago. Kristin Romey \u2014 National Geographic Oct 14, 2016, 09:47 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This post originally appeared on National Geographic. Cannabis plants were arranged across the body of a middle-aged man before his burial in Turpan, China, around 2,500 years ago. PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY HONGEN JIANG Archaeologists are hailing the discovery of an \u201cextraordinary cache\u201d of cannabis found in an ancient burial in northwest China, saying that the unique find adds considerably to our understanding of how ancient Eurasian cultures used the plant for ritual and medicinal purposes. In a report in the journal Economic Botany , archaeologist Hongen Jiang and his colleagues describe the burial of an approximately 35-year-old adult man with Caucasian features in China\u2019s Turpan Basin. The man had been laid out on a wooden bed with a reed pillow beneath his head. In an unprecendented discovery, the ancient cannabis plants were discovered in a complete and well-preserved state. PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY HONGEN JIANG Thirteen cannabis plants, each up to almost three feet long, were placed diagonally across the man\u2019s chest, with the roots oriented beneath his pelvis and the tops of the plants extending from just under his chin, up and alongside the left side of his face. ( Read how Eurasian gold artifacts tell the tale of drug-fueled rituals .) Radiocarbon dating of the tomb\u2019s contents indicates that the burial occurred approximately 2,400 to 2,800 years ago. This discovery adds to a growing collection of archaeological evidence showing that cannabis consumption was \u201cvery popular\u201d across the Eurasian steppe thousands of years ago, says Jiang. A Truly Unique Burial The burial is one of 240 graves excavated at the Jiayi cemetery in Turpan, and is associated with the Subeixi culture (also known as the Gushi Kingdom) that occupied the area between roughly 3,000 to 2,000 years ago. At the time, Turpan\u2019s desert oasis was an important stop on the Silk Road. Cannabis plant parts have been found in a few other Turpan burials, most notably in a contemporaneous burial in nearby Yanghai cemetery discovered nearly a decade ago, which contained close to two pounds of cannabis seeds and powdered leaves. \u201cThis is the first time archaeologists have recovered complete cannabis plants, as well as the first incidence of their use as a 'shroud' in a human burial.\u201d West of Turpan, cannabis seeds have also been found in first millennium B.C. Scythian burials in southern Siberia, including one of a woman who possibly died of breast cancer . Archaeologists suspect she may have been using cannabis in part to ease her symptoms. (Read \u201c Will Marijuana for Sick Kids Get Government to Rethink Weed? \u201d) However, this is the first time ever that archaeologists have recovered complete cannabis plants, as well as the first incidence of their use as a \u201cshroud\u201d or covering in a human burial, says Jiang. Locally Grown Since previous cannabis finds in Turpan burials consisted only of plant parts, it has been difficult for researchers to determine whether the plant was grown locally or obtained through trade with neighboring regions. The plants in the Jiayi burial, however, were found lying flat on the man\u2019s body, leading archaeologists to conclude that the cannabis had been fresh\u2014and therefore local\u2014when it was harvested for the burial. In addition, while nearly all of the flowering heads of the 13 female plants had been cut off before they were placed on the body, a few that remained were nearly ripe and contained some immature fruit, suggesting that the plants were collected\u2014and that the burial occurred\u2014in late summer.

PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY HONGEN JIANG Prized for Psychoactive Qualities The other question that archaeologists grapple with when they encounter cannabis is the purpose of its presence. This multipurpose plant has been valued not only for its psychoactive properties, but also for its durable hemp fibers, which could be woven into cloth, as well as its nutritious, oil-rich seeds. However, no hemp textiles have been found in Turpan burials, and the seeds of the plants in the Jiayi burial are too small to serve as a practical food source, archaeologist Jiang notes. Meanwhile, the flowering heads of the Jiayi plants were covered with glandular trichomes, a sort of tiny plant \u201chair\u201d that in cannabis secretes resin containing psychoactive cannabinoids such as THC. The researchers suspect that this marijuana was grown and harvested for its psychoactive resin, which may have been inhaled as a sort of incense or consumed in a beverage for ritual or medicinal purposes. The plants, each up to almost three feet long, were laid diagonally across the corpse in the form of a shroud.

Mars One Candidate Kenya Armbrister Opens Up About What It Takes To Go To Red Planet Mars One Candidate Thinks She Has What It Takes To Go To Red Planet By Emily Tess Katz HuffPost Live Feb 20, 2015, 08:46 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Kenya Armbrister is one step closer to an all-expenses-paid trip to Mars. The 36-year-old resident of Oakland, Calif. is one of 100 finalists -- selected from more than 200,000 submissions worldwide -- who are competing for a spot on the Mars One mission . Should she be selected for the trip, plans call for her and 23 others to move permanently to Mars to pioneer a new human settlement. In a conversation with HuffPost Live on Thursday, Armbrister explained why she deserves an opportunity to spend her life on Mars. Advertisement \"I feel like I have the qualities and characteristics that Mars One is looking for,\" she told host Marc Lamont Hill. \"I'm very adaptable. I have a team spirit attitude. I'm very resourceful and trustworthy... and that's what Mars One is looking for.\" She admitted to being \"fearful\" of what the journey could hold, but she sees \"the fear and the curiosity and the drive\" as being a unique draw for the experience. But that doesn't mean she isn't cognizant of the risks of traveling to -- and living on -- another planet. \"There's radiation that we'll have to protect ourselves from on the journey there and on Mars, but we'll be able to use the soil on Mars -- five meters of soil -- to help us protect our crops and ourselves from radiation,\" she said. \"Bone density loss as well, but there'll be a lot of counter measures done... before we even get there.\" Advertisement Her mom remains unconvinced, however. \"My mother would prefer I stay here on earth and have children and get married,\" she said, \"But my father and my brothers are super-excited and my friends, and everyone's cheering me a hundred percent.\" Watch more from Kenya Armbrister's HuffPost Live conversation in the clip above.

Why Are Teens So Moody And Impulsive? This Neuroscientist Has The Answer Why Are Teens So Moody And Impulsive? This Neuroscientist Has The Answer By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jun 14, 2015, 07:20 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Teenagers use their mobile phones after school time in Vaasa, Finland, on March 30, 2010. AFP PHOTO / OLIVIER MORIN (Photo credit should read OLIVIER MORIN/AFP/Getty Images) P arents often complain their teenagers are moody, impulsive and self-centered -- but it may not be their fault. The secret to understanding teens' behavior may lie in understanding their brain chemistry, says Dr. Frances Jensen, chair of the University of Pennsylvania neurology department and author of The Teenage Brain: A Neuroscientist's Survival Guide to Raising Adolescents and Young Adults . Advertisement Jensen, a neuroscientist and mother of two teenage boys, describes adolescence as the \"second critical period of development,\" after early childhood. The brain is developing until the mid-20s, she explains, and this has significant implications for young adults' emotional lives and decision-making. In a recent interview with HuffPost Science, Jensen answered some of our questions about the mysteries of the teenage brain. What inspired you to study the teenage brain? I\u2019ve had a career for many years looking at brain development. When I was doing all these experiments in my lab, I didn\u2019t realize that I also had an experiment going on in my house with my sons, who were definitely changing, to say the least. Advertisement What was going on with my sons was fascinating -- and it was also frustrating. So I decided that I would turn my potential anger and frustration into curiosity, and given that I was already in brain development, I just switched my focus to a different window of development, and I realized that there was a wealth of extremely recent information and a lot of this research just wasn\u2019t getting out to the public. What makes the teen brain so different from the adult brain? It was only recently that scientists realized that the brain is the last organ in the body to reach maturity and that it does not reach maturity during puberty. Development goes on into the mid-20s. That was big news, and people only became aware of it in the early 2000s when it was starting to hit the literature... As a parent and a scientist, it all started to gel for me. In every species that we look at, it's the last organ in the body to reach full maturity. Because the brain is built on experience, and it takes the first two and a half decades of life to sort of \"scaffold\" the brain. During the teenage years, your brain is actually stronger for learning and memory and being imprinted upon than it will be later in life. It\u2019s a carpe diem point. Of course, there are a lot of weaknesses, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re picking up on as a parent -- Why did this smart person do this really stupid thing? What are they thinking? Do they think? -- And a lot of that has science behind it. It\u2019s made me a more patient parent. Advertisement In terms of decision-making, would it be accurate to say that teenagers are wired to be risk-takers? Yes, it is absolutely accurate. What we know is that the frontal lobes -- which are the seat of executive function, decision-making, empathy, judgment, insight and impulse control -- are the last places that hook up to the rest of the brain during development. It\u2019s not that teens don\u2019t have frontal lobes -- they can still do really well on their SATs and reason through things. But split-second decision making is a weakness. They don\u2019t involve their frontal lobes and that explains the, \u201cOh I\u2019ll take a left into oncoming traffic because I think I can get past that truck barreling towards me.\u201d So we think the risk taking is very much biologically based and teens are very impulsive. Advertisement Their decisions -- especially the split-second decisions, which are more vulnerable -- are also under more emotional influence than they are in an adult. The emotional areas of the brain (the amygdala, the lymbic system), the reward systems and the systems for sexual desire are hooked up to the rest of the brain ahead of the frontal lobes. So they have high emotional responses. And fMRI has shown that the limbic systems light up much faster and much more intensely [in teens] than adults. That\u2019s partly because they don\u2019t have the frontal lobes to say, \u201cThere\u2019s a way out of the situation,\u201d or \u201cThere are going to be consequences if you get mad at this person.\u201d Their decisions may be under more emotional influence than they will be later in life, because there\u2019s an imbalance between the two systems. Does this also explain why teenagers are so moody? We believe this [imbalance] contributes to the moodiness and can increase the stress response, too. This is a concern because too much stress in the teen years changes the way your brain develops -- it can actually set up neurochemical imbalances that increase your risk for depression in later life. Advertisement Where do hormones fit into this picture? Hormones causing moodiness is kind of the myth. There\u2019s much more to the story than hormones, and that\u2019s a really important thing to get across. It\u2019s more about the imbalance between your frontal lobe and your limbic system than it is about the hormones that are being produced the testes and ovaries running around in your bloodstream. There\u2019s much more to the story than hormones. However, their brains are seeing levels of hormones that they\u2019ve never seen before, and they have to learn to manage those hormones. It is a learning curve on how to manage the ups and downs of a testosterone surge or the waxing and waning of estrogen and progesterone through the menstrual cycle... Through experience, the brain will dampen the fluctuations in behavior in response to fluctuations in hormones. Teenagers today are more connected to digital devices than any generation before them. Should we be concerned about how this is affecting their brains? Advertisement There\u2019s a couple things to be said about the digital invasion of our brains at that age. The first is yes, this is a thing of the future -- it\u2019s not going to go away and it\u2019s probably only going to get more intense. The amount of information that's coming at teenage brains is unprecedented compared to any other generation. They\u2019re also going to have to grow up in this world and they have to adapt. Children and teenagers can learn better than adults -- in most cases, they\u2019re learning technology better than us, and they\u2019re probably able to multitask better than adults. But they're not perfect. I cite a study in the book about teens' ability to multitask, which finds that they\u2019re better than other generations simply because they\u2019ve grown up on this. But they still do better when they\u2019re focusing on a single task rather than on multiple tasks. That\u2019s important for teenagers to know because they\u2019ll still suffer the consequences of divided attention for encoding and recall of information. Advertisement In the book, you talk about some of the particularly negative effects that smoking, drinking, marijuana and other drugs can have on the developing brain. Why might these substances be more dangerous for a teenager? Here\u2019s another myth to be debunked: Teens are not as resilient as we think they are. People say \u201cOh, they\u2019ll bounce back,\u201d but they don\u2019t. Drugs and alcohol and stress work on, guess what -- brain synapses. They have more [synapses] than we do, and it\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that those drugs will have more of an effect in the moment on those brains than they would in adulthood. With cannabis, the effects last longer for a teenager and the residual impairment of synaptic function from smoking pot can last for days. Likewise, binge drinking can actually cause brain injury in the adolescent with alcohol levels that would just cause severe intoxication in an adult. So there\u2019s the acute effect. But in addition, their brains are growing every day during this period. You give a drug, you put the brain development on hold or set it backwards. After the drug has cleared the system, the brain is not in the place it\u2019s supposed to be three days later. You\u2019ve actually changed the way the brain is developing, and neurochemical systems start to change. Advertisement A recent study found that helicopter parenting can negatively affect teens by lowering their self-esteem and increasing risky behaviors like binge-drinking and shoplifting. Is there a neurological basis to this? What you\u2019re going to get with helicopter parenting is a kind of learned helplessness. The kids have never had to make a decision. They\u2019re not even aware that there are decisions there to be made because they were denied the awareness of the decisions by the parents. I\u2019ve heard another term people have been using in the past couple years -- \u201cbulldozer parents\u201d -- who are the ones who clear the future for their kids so that they can just walk through. The teenage years are a period where you\u2019re really scaffolding, for the last time, the brain you\u2019re going to live with for the rest of your life. You\u2019re developing experiences, you\u2019re learning from the experiences, you\u2019re creating synaptic pathways. You have to learn from experience -- learning isn\u2019t all in the classroom, you have to learn from your own mistakes. Trial and error will teach you things. Advertisement I think parents should make sure they stay out of the day-to-day trial and error, because your kid is going to need to use that experience to learn when to take a risk and when not to take a risk. What you\u2019re going to get with helicopter parenting is a kind of learned helplessness. The kids have never had to make a decision, they\u2019re not even aware that there are decisions there to be made. So what should these parents do? Do with this information what you will, but parents should be aware that this is a really important time for development\u2026 Helicopter parents are often very well-meaning, but they\u2019d be better off helping their kids with their own introspection, which is something a teenager has a great deal of challenge with as they develop their frontal lobes and their own comfort with themselves. You can help guide them through discussions, making them answer their own questions but structuring it for them. Advertisement It\u2019s like Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s 10,000 hours [of practice at a skill]. If you deny your kid those 10,000 hours, you\u2019re doing irrevocable damage to their future, probably. Any other neuroscientist-approved advice for parents -- or teenagers themselves? Being armed with facts can help you be a more patient parent because you understand the neurobiology. It also helps the kids themselves. When I give talks to kids, they\u2019re really excited to hear that they\u2019re seeking their identities in these years. They can change their fortunes. If you\u2019re not a scholar at 14, it\u2019s important for you to know that the doors aren\u2019t all closed. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Why you Get so Pumped up Watching Sports Sports create a relationship between the fan and the players. This relationship resembles that of a family.

OSTON, MA - FEBRUARY 1: New England Patriots fans cheer after the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX at Jerry Remy's Sports Bar February 1, 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images) Do you get pumped up watching sports? Do you ever feel so involved in watching a game, that you feel like you are in the game? Sports create a relationship between the fan and the players. This relationship resembles that of a family. Sports fans, like other people, separate themselves out into similar groups with common values, religions, aesthetics, ethnicities and so forth. Advertisement This kind of connection has primal overtones, in that primitive man survived in tribes through co-dependent relationships (1). And, when people in general connect by groups through their similarities, they are protecting themselves against annihilation. Thus, the team becomes a tribe, and the fan becomes invested in its identity. This feeling of belonging becomes so powerful that it can create biases, as well as prejudices. And, fans are so emotionally invested in their tribe, or sports team, that they may defend that relationship against verbal or physical attack. Feelings of belonging to a particular team are so powerful that they impact feelings of well-being, alienation, loneliness, energy levels and depression. We are, after all, social animals, and our feelings of purpose and belonging are affected by our group's identity, including our chosen sports team. Moreover, sports give the fan a place to focus and sublimate his feelings of stress and frustration from his daily life and the world at large. When the fan is focused on a sports play, he might actually imagine that he's involved in the activity on the field. In fact, a fan's hormonal responses during the game may actually imitate that of the sports players. His body's biology then moves him into the flight or fight syndrome, his adrenalin starts pumping, and his excitement and energy can reach pitches equivalent to fighting that lion or running away. Advertisement In the final analysis, there are great intrinsic rewards for being the sports fan. Not only do we have an acceptable place to focus and deliver high levels of emotional stress and response, but also receive feelings of well-being, trust and satisfaction in our social life.

Dogs Don't Like It When People Diss Their Owners, And They Diss Right Back Here's Scientific Proof That Your Dog Has Your Back By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 15, 2015, 09:03 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Rover knows more about rudeness than you might think. New research from Japan indicates that dogs seem to know when someone is snubbing their owner --and are willing to deliver a snub in return even if it means forgoing food, Agence France-Presse reported. \"We discovered for the first time that dogs make social and emotional evaluations of people regardless of their direct interest,\" Dr. Kazuo Fujita, professor of comparative cognition at Kyoto University and the study's lead researcher, told AFP. \"This ability is one of key factors in building a highly collaborative society, and this study shows that dogs share that ability with humans.\" Advertisement For the study, the researchers conducted three experiments involving 54 dogs. In each experiment, the dog's owner pretended to need help opening a container while in the company of two people the dog didn't know. In the first experiment, the owner asked one of the people for help but was shut down by the person rudely turning away while the second person did nothing. In the second experiment, the owner asked for and received assistance while the second person didn't get involved. In the third, \"control\" experiment, the dog owner didn't interact with the other two people at all. But \"the same motion (turning away) was there in the control condition, too,\" Fujita told The Huffington Post in an email. \"The control condition was to decline the possibility that dogs simply might dislike this head movement.\" Advertisement Then, after watching their owners' interactions with the unfamiliar people, all of the dogs were offered food by both of the strangers. What did the researchers find? Overwhelmingly, most of the dogs whose owners didn't receive help ignored the food from the person who wouldn't help their owner, but would accept food from the neutral person. The dogs whose owners were either helped or had no interaction with the two people showed no preference for either stranger's food offer. \"The dogs\u2019 avoidance of someone who behaved negatively to the owner suggests that social eavesdropping may be shared with a nonprimate species,\" Fujita said in the email. \"It is because dogs are usually extremely attentive to what their owners are doing.\" Advertisement The study is to be published in an upcoming issue of in the journal Animal Behaviour .

ESA Lander Prepares For Historic Mars Landing Europe's first Mars rover will search for traces of life on the planet. Maria Sheahan Oct 15, 2016, 10:56 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING FRANKFURT - A Mars lander is due to leave its mothership on Sunday and head toward the red planet\u2019s surface to test technologies for Europe\u2019s planned first Mars rover, which will search for signs of past and present life. After a seven-month journey from Earth as part of the European-Russian ExoMars program, the Schiaparelli lander is expected to separate from spacecraft Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) at 10:42 a.m. EDT and start a three-day descent to the surface. Advertisement Schiaparelli represents only the second European attempt to land a craft on Mars, after a failed mission by the British landing craft Beagle 2 in 2003. Landing on Mars, Earth\u2019s neighbor some 35 million miles (56 million km) away, is a notoriously difficult task that has bedevilled most Russian efforts and given NASA trouble as well. The United States currently has two operational rovers on Mars, Curiosity and Opportunity. But a seemingly hostile environment has not detracted from the allure of Mars, with U.S. President Barack Obama recently highlighting his pledge to send people to the planet by the 2030s. Advertisement Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is developing a massive rocket and capsule to transport large numbers of people and cargo to Mars with the ultimate goal of colonizing the planet, with Musk saying he would like to launch the first crew as early as 2024. The primary goal of ExoMars is to find out whether life has ever existed on Mars. The current spacecraft carries an atmospheric probe to study trace gases such as methane, around the planet. Scientists believe that methane, a chemical that on Earth is strongly tied to life, could stem from micro-organisms that either became extinct millions of years ago and left gas frozen below the planet\u2019s surface, or that some methane-producing organisms still survive. Advertisement The second part of the ExoMars mission, delayed to 2020 from 2018, will deliver a European rover to the surface of Mars. It will be the first with the ability to both move across the planet\u2019s surface and drill into the ground to collect and analyze samples. The ExoMars 2016 mission is led by the European Space Agency (ESA), with Russia\u2019s Roscosmos supplying the launcher and two of the four scientific instruments on the trace gas orbiter.

How Personality Affects Gene Expression And Immune System Function How Personality Influences Your Immune System By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 22, 2015, 10:53 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Health depends on a number of factors -- genetics, environment, lifestyle factors, and according to new research, personality might also play a large role in determining health outcomes. Some research has suggested that personality can play a role in the risk of developing certain physical health problems. Now, a new study has found that personality traits may also be a factor in how well the body fights disease. Advertisement Personality traits including extroversion, neuroticism and conscientiousness -- considered to be part of the \"big five\" personality traits, which also includes agreeableness and openness -- play an important role in immune system function, according to research recently published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology . In a study of 121 healthy participants (with an average age of 24 years old), researchers from the University of Nottingham examined the relationship between these personality traits and patterns of gene expression. The participants filled out personality evaluations, answered questions about their health behaviors. Then, the researchers analyzed their blood samples to examine the activity of 19 different genes involved in inflammatory immune responses. While extroversion was associated with greater expression of pro-inflammatory genes, conscientiousness was associated with reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes. This suggests that extroverts are more able to fight off infections. Advertisement Inflammation is a response initiated by the immune system to fight off foreign invaders. While this response is an important way that the body stays healthy, too much inflammation can lead to a number of health problems. The findings suggest that extroverts may be more able to fight off infections, but they might also be more vulnerable to harmful chronic inflammation. While the association is intriguing, more research is needed to pinpoint the biological mechanisms underlying the link between personality factors and gene expression. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The findings join a growing body of research investigating the link between personality traits and various physical health conditions. Previous research has found that the Big Five trait of openness to experience may actually boost protective immune system function, while personality types more prone to negative affect (also known as \"Type D\" personalities) are more likely to develop the inflammatory autoimmune condition Ulcerative Colitis. A number of studies have also suggested that those with Type A personalities face a higher risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.

Is Sexism in Science Actually Paternalism? Because of improvements in medical ethics over the past thirty years, we tend to think that this paternalistic attitude no longer or minimally exists. However paternalism in science is all too alive and healthy. By Aysha Akhtar, M.D., M.P.H., Contributor Neurologist, public health specialist, author Neurologist, public health specialist, author Jun 17, 2015, 04:22 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

There's an infection called Hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is common among young children and is caused by a virus. Lately, there seems to be another illness, Foot- in- mouth disease, that's been going viral, at least socially. The main difference between these diseases is that the latter seems to affect mostly adults, and more specifically, adult male scientists. The most recent victim of this Foot-in-mouth disease is Tim Hunt, a 2001 Nobel Prize winner in Physiology or Medicine, for his comment about women in the lab. Advertisement His rather bizarre remark spurred a fury of backlash and some rather hilarious tweets by female scientists with the hashtag #distractinglysexy. As mentioned in The Atlantic , Hunt's comment is just one of a recent spew of highly publicized instances of sexism in science, including a PLOS ONE peer-reviewer who suggested that two female researchers find \"one or two male biologists\" to co-author and thus \"strengthen\" their manuscript. As a female in what's considered the brainiest field in medicine--neurology--I have personally encountered this sexism throughout my career. I've had male researchers call me \"young lady\", rather than Dr. Akhtar, in an attempt to denigrate me, and more importantly, my opinions. One supervisor told me that I should consider pursuing a different course of study so that I would be seen as \"more than just a pretty face.\" And these are just a few of my own personal experiences. Advertisement While individuals like Hunt may be outliers in the sense that they actually had the audacity to publicly express their backward views in this Twitter-trigger world (seriously, don't they know by now??!), my own experiences and these examples suggest that sexist views in the sciences are widespread. However, as clearly sexist as these comments and behaviors are, I think that these cases represent something that goes beyond sexism. I think they are rooted in an \"ism\" that is far subtler and far more dangerous--paternalism. The sciences, particularly the biological and medical sciences, have a long history of paternalism. Doctors and scientists, for example, traditionally treated patients and others as less than capable of making informed and rational decisions. Rather than seeing patients as partners who should be permitted to make decisions based on their own values and preferences, doctors often withheld vital information or coerced patients under the guise that doctors knew what was best. Advertisement \"Trust us\", was the scientific world's philosophy, \"we know what's best for you.\" Scientists put themselves in a special category, the elite and intellectual, who were immune to outside criticism from others who were perceived as ignorant. Because of improvements in medical ethics over the past thirty years, we tend to think that this paternalistic attitude no longer or minimally exists. However paternalism in science is all too alive and healthy. Women, members of minority races, and the non-scientist public have traditionally been viewed as the outsiders in the predominately male and Caucasian Western scientific world--and I think that they still are. They are the \"others\" who benefit from the \"authority\" and \"rational\" mind of scientists. I believe that this \"trust us, we know what's best for you\" attitude is at the root of many of the examples we lump as sexism. Advertisement The supervisor who tried to convince me to follow a different career path was providing what he thought was valuable guidance and he believed I should defer to him as an authority. The PLOS ONE medical reviewer probably thought he was giving sage advice to the female investigators who, in his mind, needed the assistance of a rational, male mentor. Tim Hunt's comment about women in the lab and his advice for single-sex labs suggest that he believed he was offering sound advice for female scientists. To demonstrate the dangers of this paternalistic behavior, take a different, but equally bizarre, case that also recently came to light. Dr. John Henry Hagmann, a former U.S. Army physician, found himself in the spotlight for allegedly requiring his students to perform invasive medical procedures on each other. Advertisement His company, Deployment Military International, has received more than $10.5 million of taxpayer funds to train military personnel and others in operational medicine since the year 2000. According to an investigation by the Virginia Board of Medicine, Hagmann instructed trainees to perform medical procedures such as genital catheter insertion, penile nerve block, and shock labs, in which he withdrew blood from the trainees, monitored them for shock, and then transfused the blood back into their systems. These allegations follow years of complaints about Hagmann's training courses in which, as this video shows , live animals are taken into the woods, brutally shot, and ripped apart for military drills, even though superior simulation methods exist. Hagmann readily dismissed the allegations and said they were \"amplified by animal rights advocates or those with an anti-military agenda.\" Additionally, Hagmann said that his trainees are \" students\", not \"patients\", as the Virginia board calls them, and therefore he may have them perform procedures on one another as part of the educational process. Advertisement Hagmann further defended an incident in which he took a student to his warehouse and examined and photographed the student's uncircumscribed penis by arguing, \"the debate on the value and impact of circumcision is a current medical and social issue. The historical link between circumcision and masturbation is a fact dating since Victorian England and is still a current topic subject to scientific research.\" Hagmann believes his practices are important, ethical, and not to be questioned--attitudes very much aligned with the worst aspects of paternalism. Of course paternalism is linked with sexism (it's not called maternalism for a reason), but I believe that paternalism is much more troubling than sexism as the former frequently leads to extremely unethical practices. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

As we have seen with past examples like the Tuskegee experiments, paternalism is dangerous because when we default to blindly trusting scientists as \"authorities\", abuses will happen. Sure scientists are educated in their respective fields, but we should not assume that they are without biases and blind spots. After all, \"father\" does not always know best.

Well East Coast, You Certainly Didn't Get A White Christmas Temperature records were shattered around the U.S. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 25, 2015, 11:36 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The warmer weather enabled this cyclist to go out wearing shorts, sneakers and no socks in a downtown Manhattan street on Christmas Eve. Credit: Associated Press/Kathy Willens If you live in America, odds are you didn't wake up to anything near a white Christmas. Temperature records around the U.S. were shattered on Christmas Eve, with some cities like Baltimore seeing highs up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal. So what's up? It all links back to the polar vortex , the surge of cold air that hit the U.S. several winters ago, causing temperatures to plunge far below zero. Advertisement A band of cold air called the \" Arctic Oscillation \" surrounds the northern latitudes of the globe. Usually, the oscillation spins quickly and traps most of the cold air around the pole, but sometimes the band will slow and some of that cold will slip downwards, which is what happened during the polar vortex. The opposite is happening now, and that oscillation is moving far faster, keeping all the cold air trapped north and making temperatures in parts of America warmer, according to the National Weather Service.

Put Your Feet Where Your Values Are: March For Science Science is not a partisan issue.

LEAVE A COMMENT DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS via Getty Images Take out your mobile phone and give it a good look. Curiosity made that. Curiosity coupled with intense concentration, wild imagination, bold hypotheses, and years of experimental toil to validate them. The slim device in your hand encapsulates 500 years of physics. Newtonian mechanics, James Clerk Maxwell\u2019s equations for electromagnetism, Einstein\u2019s relativity, Bohr\u2019s atomic theory, Turing\u2019s universal computer, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s quantum wave function, Feynman\u2019s diagram: all these and more streamed into the phone you hold in your hand. And that\u2019s just one branch of science. Somewhere on your upper arm is a tiny scar that represents your vaccination against tuberculosis \u2014 the White Death, a plague that claimed the lives of one in five young Americans before the twentieth century. Advertisement Today, in just one month\u2019s edition of \u201cScientific American\u201d there are stories about a realistic plan to send tiny spacecraft to the nearest star within our lifetimes, a tested method of redesigning T-cells drawn from our own bodies to be hypervigilant cancer killers, an ingenious technique to discover the true coloration of dinosaurs, new ways to test robotic systems to determine if they truly possess humanlike intelligence, and a practical experiment to determine if alleviating a mother\u2019s poverty will improve the brain of her newborn child during the first three years of life. If nothing on that list thrills you, stirs hope in your breast, or awakens your sense of wonder, then throw your phone away. Refuse to vaccinate your kids. Close your mind to the wonders yet to come. Science is not for you. But\u2026 If you can see the connection between scientific exploration and the quality of our lives; if you value discovery for its own sake as well as the practical benefits it confers; if you perceive how science plays a critical role in warning us of the dangers ahead and how to defuse them, then prepare to march . Advertisement \u201cIf you can see the connection between scientific exploration and the quality of our lives, then prepare to march.\u201d Why? Because ideological denial of science has metastasized from slogans to a cancer on our nation. The White House has purged scientific information, gagged government scientists, and is reversing efforts to mitigate global warming. The new head of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, has fought scientific advice on curbing unnecessary (but highly profitable) medical tests. The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is an ardent opponent of environmental regulation and a denier of anthropogenic climate change. A physicist said to be the frontrunner for presidential science adviser goes a step further: William Happer declares that climate change will be great for humanity. This is like saying that lighting a torch in a fireworks factory will result in a beautiful display. It could happen, but it\u2019s much more likely that we\u2019d have a calamitous blast. Advertisement Yet, for all that the attacks on science appear to come from one political party, science is not a partisan issue. It\u2019s not any kind of issue. Rather, science is a proven method for acquiring reliable knowledge about the world we inhabit and the means to make life better for all. Yes, it creates problems, too\u2014but it also offers solutions to those problems. Progress is real, and it\u2019s a wagon hitched to science. The wheels may be momentarily stuck in the mud of retrograde ideology, but that just means we have to get out and push. Maybe your shoe leather is worn thin already. Maybe you did the Women\u2019s March or you stayed home on \u201cA Day Without Immigrants.\u201d Possibly you\u2019ve taken some other stand for resistance. Your feet burn.

Talking To A Therapist Could Be The Secret To Sleeping Better Talking To A Therapist Could Be The Secret To Sleeping Better By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jun 13, 2015, 07:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Sleeping pills may not be the only option for the 50million to 70 million Americans suffering from chronic insomnia. A new review of research suggests that talking to a therapist should be the first line of treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy is effective for improving sleep among individuals suffering from chronic insomnia, according to an analysis of 20 previous studies published online this week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . CBT is a form of psychotherapy that targets chronic stress and anxiety -- often at the root of sleeping problems -- by helping patients to identify dysfunctional thought patterns and behaviors. Advertisement \"People with chronic insomnia worry about the lack of sleep and the impact of insomnia on daytime functioning,\" Dr. Charles Morin, a Canadian sleep researcher, told WebMD . \"That becomes a vicious cycle. The more you worry about sleep, the longer you stay awake. CBT is directly aimed at short-circuiting this cycle.\" Roughly 10 percent of adults suffer from chronic insomnia, which is defined as insomnia occurring at least three nights a week for a month or longer. The researchers analyzed statistics drawn from more than 1,162 sleep deprived participants . They found CBT improved sleep efficiency by nearly 10 percent. It also helped patients fall asleep 19 minutes earlier and sleep for an average of 7.6 minutes longer. Patients were also able to fall asleep more quickly after waking up during the night. Advertisement \"This supports recommendations that CBT [for insomnia] should be used as the initial intervention for chronic insomnia when possible,\" the study's lead author, Dr. James Trauer of the Melbourne Sleep Disorders Centre , wrote. \"One major advantage is that [cognitive therapy] involves teaching skills to patients that they can then maintain lifelong and use whenever symptoms recur,\" he added . Another recent study found a single one-hour CBT session helped 60 percent of people with short-term insomnia to sleep better. Advertisement Incorporating CBT as a treatment isn't a quick fix, Morin warns. It \"inevitably requires more time and effort for both the clinician and the patient,\" he wrote in an editorial published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in response to the findings. But CBT is a healthier treatment alternative to medicating, The New York Times noted . Using therapy eliminates the side effects and potential long-term health consequences of using sleeping pills. Using CBT instead of medication to treat insomnia has also been found to reduce health care costs, according to a 2014 Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine study .

AIDS Drug 'Candidate' Shown To Block Infection By Even The Most Virulent Strains Of HIV Experimental AIDS Drug Stirs Talk Of Vaccine 'Alternative' By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 18, 2015, 01:01 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT For more than three decades, scientists have tried unsuccessfully to develop an effective vaccine for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS. But now researchers say they have created an experimental drug that may function as a sort of \"alternative\" vaccine for the virus. The experimental drug, a protein known as eCD4-IG, blocks infection by keeping the virus from binding to the immune cells that are the virus's target. In tests on monkeys, the drug \"candidate\" proved to be extremely effective at blocking infection--even with the most virulent strains of HIV and its simian counterpart, SIV. \"Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,\" Dr. Michael Farzan, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Fla. and the leader of the research effort, said in a written statement. \"Unlike antibodies, which fail to neutralize a large fraction of HIV-1 strains, our protein has been effective against all strains tested .\" Advertisement Farzan said the protein could offer \"an effective HIV vaccine alternative,\" and other researchers seem to share his optimism. \"What Mike [Farzan] has done very ingeniously is to develop a molecule that attacks HIV in two different spots ... that is able to neutralize most if not all strains of HIV,\" Dr. Philip Johnson, a University of Pennsylvania researcher who was not involved in the research, told Newsweek. But not everyone is convinced that the protein will work as well in humans as it does in monkeys. Dr. David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning virologist at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., called the research \"impressive\" but sounded a note of caution.

Half of the world's languages are endangered, and rapidly passing into oblivion. Manx--the ancient Celtic tongue spoken on the Isle of Man--had all but vanished by the 1970s. Defying the odds, it has returned to daily use through the heroic efforts of Manx language warriors. I visited the Isle of Man recently to hear the story of Manx's surprising survival. Manxmen--as they call themselves--take pride in their resilience. \"Whichever way you throw me, I will stand,\" a Manx motto asserts. Thriving under Viking invasion, British colonization, and island isolation, the Manx have built a thriving, tech-savvy, 21st century culture. Advertisement Manx was declared extinct after the 1974 passing of \"last speaker\" Ned Maddrell, whose recorded voice may be heard in the local museum. As Manx slipped into dormancy, those who spoke even a little were made to feel ashamed. People mostly stopped speaking Manx in public, and many disavowed or neglected it. Some managed to learn Manx as a second language, by listening to legacy recordings, talking with elders, and reading old books. So, even though for a time no native speakers may have remained, there was a continuity of spoken Manx. The author listening to the recorded voice of Ned Maddrell, famed \"last native speaker\" at the Manx museum. Advertisement A few islanders kept the language in their hearts, and as part of their identity. Musician Ealee Sheard recalls how tales evoked a mythical landscape: \"I was always brought up with the Manx fairy stories...water spirits, things that live in wells, and the Cabyll-Ushtey, which is a lovely white horse that lures young maidens into the sea to try to drown them...\" Brian Stowell recalls that, as a teenager in the 1950s, it was viewed as crazy to waste time learning Manx. \"People would say: 'You shouldn't waste your time with that nonsense...that was never a real language'...There were some very strong negative attitudes.\" Today, Stowell basks in the success of Manx's revival. \"It's also a worldwide movement...people looking for identity, and looking to pick up scraps of what was left to them of an older culture.\" What's the value of an obscure island tongue, in an era of global English and ascendant Chinese? \"I just fell in love with the language,\" says Rob Teare. He explains how: \"The Manx language is a Manx view of the world. It's a language that evolved to describe this place...the language contains the history and culture of the island. To lose that, you lose that input into world discourse.\" Advertisement In the 1980s, activists who had learned Manx as adults launched a bold social experiment. They raised their children bilingually, speaking exclusively Manx to them in the home, and letting them speak English elsewhere. These children, now grown, are the \"new native speakers.\" Today, seventy Manx children, mostly from English-speaking homes, attend Bunscoill Ghaelgagh immersion school. Led by educator Julie Matthews, eager pupils sing Manx songs, skip rope to Manx rhymes, and study science and mathematics in their heritage tongue. As early adopters of technology, the Manx have created iPhone apps, learning videos and social media sites. They text, podcast, and even translate movies into Manx using the subtitling platform Viki.com . Technology extends Manx's reach far beyond the island. As Rob Teare notes : \"Now there's no physical restraint on the language. It's global.\" Advertisement Pupils at the Manx immersion school, St. John's, Isle of Man Once subsided to a whisper, an echo from a fog-shrouded island of ghosts and faeries, Manx now speaks with a confident voice. It tells a story of cultural survival, and of defying the odds, that resonates around the globe. As activist Adrian Cain notes: \"We're all part of a family, a global community, and you know, a loss of a minority language is a shame anywhere.\" He continues: \"If people in the Isle of Man can do it, there is hope for other minority languages as well.\" Go to Homepage Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

You May Be Able To Train Your Brain To Be Fearless A developing treatment called neurofeedback may help people suffering from anxiety and PTSD. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Oct 10, 2016, 06:24 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT KellyJHall/Getty Images All your fears, stresses and anxieties have one thing in common. They are sensed by a pair of pea-sized patches of neurons, called the amygdala, sitting deep inside your brain. So what if you could control your amygdala? What if you could change your brain and become calmer and braver? That idea has a particular appeal for people suffering from depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder . But it\u2019s easier said than done. The amygdala is an old part of the brain that does its job automatically, without much care for commands from more conscious parts of the mind. You can\u2019t just tell an oversensitive amygdala to quiet down. Advertisement But a brain training technique known as neurofeedback might help people find a way to change such involuntary and automatic brain processes. In recent years, the technique is being developed and refined to address mental health issues. The treatment involves monitoring a person\u2019s brain activity in real time using electroencephalography (EEG) or functional MRI brain scans, and showing those patterns of activity to the person so they can try to boost or reduce them \u2015 basically, changing how their brain functions. In a new study published last month in Biological Psychiatry, researchers set up a series of experiments to use neurofeedback to teach several dozen people how to regulate their amygdala activity. \u201cPeople were able to use this new EEG model to learn how to control their brain activity in a deeply located brain area, the amygdala,\u201d said Dr. Talma Hendler, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the Tel Aviv Center for Brain Functions in Israel. Advertisement \u201cThis method \"opens a wide horizon of treatment possibilities for the mentally ill, but also for everyone on a daily basis as an empowering tool for mental activity and well being.\u201d\u201d - Dr. Talma Hendler, Tel Aviv Center for Brain Functions Reading brain signals from deep parts of the brain is difficult, especially with a cheap and accessible method. Functional MRI, or fMRI, can access these areas, but the device is a complex, gigantic magnet that you can\u2019t just set up at home, even if you could afford it. EEG, on the other hand, is cheaper and simpler. It mainly involves a few electrodes placed on the scalp. The downside of EEG is that it can\u2019t accurately zoom in on structures deep in the brain. Advertisement So, the researchers combined the two methods. They used the detail provided by fMRI to tease out the amygdala\u2019s signal from the electrical activity picked up by the EEG. \u201c[This method] enables home-based imaging that [targets] brain regions relevant for our mental health,\u201d Hendler said. \u201cIt opens a wide horizon of treatment possibilities for the mentally ill, but also for everyone on a daily basis as an empowering tool for mental activity and well being.\u201d For the experiments, Hendler and her colleagues asked the volunteers to listen to a sound. They were then instructed to lower the volume of the sound by \u201cexercising mental strategies.\u201d Advertisement It sounds like a vague instruction. What are the mental strategies that can, seemingly telepathically, control the volume of a sound? No one really knows, and that\u2019s sort of the point. People have to try many different ways of thinking \u2015 thereby changing their brain activity \u2015 until they stumble upon a desired activity pattern. What the participants didn\u2019t know was that the volume of the sound was programmed to change based on the electrical activity of their own amygdala, and it would lower if the participants managed to dial down that activity. In other words, they were listening to their own amygdala\u2019s firing, disguised in a sound. A series of tests afterward showed that this game seemed to help participants become more capable of regulating the activity of their amygdala. In response to viewing a series of images, for example, the participants\u2019 amygdalas seemed less sensitive compared to those of people in another group given a fake neurofeedback treatment. Advertisement The participants in this study were healthy. But Hendler believes that people with mental health problems, too, would respond to training with neurofeedback. \u201cWe already have indication for this (unpublished yet) that people suffering from depression, chronic pain and post traumatic disorders are able to learn and greatly benefit from such training,\u201d Hendler said. If the method proves useful in treating mental health conditions in the future, this low-cost, personalized treatment could be used at home to complement and sometimes substitute medications, Hendler said.

Scientists Create World's Coldest Molecules Ever Scientists Create World's Coldest Molecules By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 15, 2015, 08:45 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It doesn't get much cooler than this. Physicists at MIT have created what may be world's coldest chemically stable molecules , chilling sodium potassium gas to half of one millionth of a degree above absolute zero (defined as minus 273 degrees Celsius or minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 on the Kelvin scale used by many scientists). \"Now we\u2019re at 500 nanokelvins, which is already fantastic, we love it,\" Dr. Martin Zwierlein, one of the physicists, said in a written statement. \"A factor of 10 colder or so, and the music starts playing.\u201d Advertisement Only chemically unstable molecules -- which decay quickly -- had been cooled to such a low temperature before, according to Zwierlein. His team's feat breaks the previous record for coldest chemically stable molecules , which was set last year by a team of British, French and Austrian scientists, by a factor of at least 10. Scientists create such \"supercold\" molecules in order to observe exotic forms of matter and quantum processes , according to Live Science. Among the exotic forms of matter the researchers hope to see are so-called \"superfluid crystals.\" As Zwierlein explained in the statement, these crystalline forms \"feel no friction, which is totally bizarre. This has not been observed so far, but predicted. We might not be far from seeing these effects, so we\u2019re all excited.\u201d Advertisement And ultracold molecules may also be used in quantum computing . \u201cThe molecules could be used as quantum bits, where \u20180\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 is robustly encoded in the rotation of the molecules,\u201d Zwierlein told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cQuantum computation itself would be extremely important for cryptography and to solve certain types of problems that simply take impossibly long on a \u2018classical\u2019 computer.\u201d (Story continues below image.) The molecules had the strongest \u201cdipole moments\u201d (arrows) -- imbalances in the distribution of charge across the molecules, which lead to magnet-like interactions -- ever observed in ultracold molecules. For the research, Zwierlein and his colleagues used one set of lasers to cool sodium and potassium atoms separately, and trap them. Then they applied a magnetic field to get the atoms to form a weak bond. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s like tuning your radio to be in resonance with some station,\u201d Zwierlein said in the statement. \u201cThese atoms start to vibrate happily together, and form a bound molecule.\u201d To strengthen that bond, the researchers used a technique involving another set of lasers -- a high-energy and a low-energy beam -- to \"suck away\" heat from the molecules and bring them to their lowest vibrational and rotational states. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

They observed that the molecules were stable for around 2.5 seconds, which is considered a relatively long lifetime. And they were far less reactive than molecules at room temperature, tending not to collide with other molecules around them. Advertisement Next, the team hopes to cool molecules to an even lower temperature, study the interactions between them, and learn more about the limits on their lifetime. A paper describing the research was published on May 18, 2015 in the journal Physical Review Letters.

Kids' Adorable Observations About The World May Have Been Crucial To Their Survival Scientists reveal how kids keep getting caring attention from parents once they grow out of their cute baby faces. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Oct 21, 2016, 06:18 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Jodie Griggs via Getty Images Babies have an almost magical ability to melt the hearts of adults \u2015 most adults, anyway. Earlier this year, scientists revealed that infants\u2019 cuteness doesn\u2019t end with just chubby cheeks, button noses and other visual features. It also includes how they sound and smell. It\u2019s as if babies are designed to shower us in a positive sensory overload targeting all senses. And this is no accident. Throughout evolution, babies (of humans and probably most other animals) developed ways to optimally attract the attention of adults, whom they need in order to survive. Research going back to the 1940s by renowned ethologist Konrad Lorenz, who looked at babies\u2019 physical features and face \u2014 what he called the baby schema \u2014 suggests they are not funny or cute by chance, but that cuteness has some sort of evolutionary purpose by provoking a care reaction in adults. Advertisement But what happens when babies grow out of infancy, and their extremely cute faces morph into something less baby-like and more adult-like? This is a particularly important question for human kids who have a long childhood and a long period of dependency on adults. They have to develop another strategy to keep a firm grip on our hearts. And, of course, they have. As their outside cuteness slowly fades, kids seem to use another skill to continue getting caring attention from parents: something that a group of scientists in Spain have dubbed cognitive babyness . \u201cPreschoolers have something that seems as strong as the baby schema in infants. Something that makes children more appealing for adults,\u201d said psychologist Carlos Hernandez Blasi of University Jaume I in Castellon, Spain. \u201cWhat we find is that precisely in this period from 2 to 7 years old, which we call early childhood, these important cues for adults are not so physical in nature but cognitive.\u201d Advertisement Kids at this age show a type of immature thinking that comes off as cute and funny, and provokes a positive emotion and caring reaction in adults, Blasi and his colleagues found in experiments. Just like Alice, young kids see the world as a wonderland where inanimate things and animals have human-like characteristics. Fine Art Images via Getty Images One such immature thinking involves showing a bias to attribute lifelike and human motivations to inanimate things. For example, a child might say \u201cthe sun didn\u2019t come out because he was mad.\u201d This type of thinking is called animism. Advertisement Another is finalism, or a bias to attribute specific purposes or \u201creasons for being this way\u201d to events. For example, a kid might say that a mountain has a big peak and a small peak, because the big one is for long hikes and the small one is for short hikes. \u201cWe have labelled this group of cognitive traits as reflecting supernatural thinking , because what they share is an explanation of natural phenomena that involves some form of supernatural or magical causation,\u201d Blasi and his colleagues wrote in a new paper in the British Journal of Psychology. Overestimating one's ability is a common thinking pattern seen in children. Hulton Collection via Getty Images Advertisement Not all childlike thinking involves magical causation and supernatural elements. Overestimating one\u2019s ability (to memorize a long list of 50 items, for example) is one of type of such natural immature thinking. To determine the effects of these various modes of thinking on adults, Blasi and his team presented college students with pairs of short vignettes. One depicted a child showing immature thinking (of either the natural or supernatural type) and a second depicted another child using the same type of mature thinking that adults show. The study participants had to rank the hypothetical children, who ranged in age from 3 to 9, on a dozen adjectives, including, cute, sneaky, smart and helpless. Advertisement The researchers found that adults rated the children exhibiting immature supernatural thinking more positively and as more helpless than children expressing mature cognition. Sometimes the vignettes were accompanied by a child\u2019s face, but the cognitive cues seemed to be more powerful than facial cues in evoking adults\u2019 positive reactions. This suggest that for kids beyond infancy, cute behavior trumps a cute face when competing for parents\u2019 caregiving responses. \u201cIt was more important what the kids said than what they looked like,\u201d Blasi said. In a series of similar experiments, Blasi and his colleagues have found similar effects for both men and women, parents and non-parents, and in two different countries, the United States and Spain. Advertisement Another piece of evidence that supernatural thinking in young kids serves to boost parental attention is that a 12-year-old doesn\u2019t find it cute. The positive reaction seems to emerge at some point after puberty. \u201cO lder adolescents\u2019 reaction is similar to adults,\u201d Blasi said. \u201cIt seems that this reaction is not something you are born with but develops later on.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What happens to babies and children who aren\u2019t all that cute, physically or cognitively? Although these young humans may experience some discrimination early on, it doesn\u2019t mean that they would be totally ignored. The babyness that provokes in adults an urge to protect comes in many forms, and a cuter face may just make the reaction come easier and faster. Advertisement And no one stays cute forever anyway.

Why This Mysterious Fungus Has People Talking Its unusual appearance has a lot to do with it. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Dec 24, 2015, 03:37 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Clathrus archeri, also known as octopus stinkhorn mushroom or devil's fingers. empire331 via Getty Images Here's a bizarre organism to stretch your imagination. The Clathrus archeri , commonly known as octopus stinkhorn or devil's fingers, is a pinkish fungus with four to eight dark, foul-smelling arms that erupt from a gelatinous egg. People have been buzzing since wildlife enthusiast Dan Hoare apparently found some devil's fingers in southern England last month and shared images on Twitter. The shots of the fungus in its egg stage are truly bizarre. Advertisement Alien eggs hatching in the new forest: the wonderfully weird Devil's Fingers pic.twitter.com/wiFeYr22vO \u2014 Dan Hoare (@DJHbutterflies) November 10, 2015 The mushroom is native to Australia and New Zealand, and is rarely seen in the United Kingdom. However, devil's fingers have been present in Great Britain since at least 1946, when it was first spotted in Cornwall, England, according to the Royal Botanic Gardens . Despite its demonic name, the fungus has no known hazards. For more info, check out this video from Marlow Renton of WildFoodUK.

The Pluto Flyby Is Nearing Its End, But We Can Still Visit In VR From its giant icy heart to its mountain ranges, there\u2019s a lot to (virtually) explore on the dwarf planet. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Oct 11, 2016, 02:22 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The easiest way to visit Pluto? Virtual reality. CuriosityStream I started tracking around the Sputnik Planum on the left chamber of Pluto\u2019s icy heart . I picked up a rock bigger than myself and threw it to watch it float away in the slow motion that comes with low gravity. I went up icy mountains, and looked around \u2014 there were miles of rugged cratered terrain, bearing witness to the dwarf planet\u2019s old history of meteor showers. Then I went back to my virtual spaceship, hovering under a starry sky and a dim blob of a sun, to transport myself to Krun Macula , the dark regions named after a mythical lord of the underworld. It can be both exhilarating and dizzying to walk up and down Pluto\u2019s cliffs in the immersive world of virtual reality, especially for the uninitiated like me. But I was mostly amazed to find myself in a virtual world composed entirely of images and data acquired and sent to Earth by NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft only a year ago. Advertisement My virtual visit to Pluto took place at an event held by CuriosityStream , a young company that provides subscription-based streaming of documentary film. The VR experience is an appendix to an 11-episode series called \u201cDestination: Pluto,\u201d said Jorge Franzini, a producer of the series. P lanetary scientist Alan Stern, the principal investigator of NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission to Pluto, also got a chance to put on goggles and walk around. \u201cI was very impressed. I want them to VR the rest of the planet. The samples they did were fabulous,\u201d he said. Advertisement Alan Stern, a NASA scientist who led the mission for the exploration of Pluto, checks out the Pluto VR experience. Rachel M Fry It all started with a postal stamp in 1991, which read \u201c Pluto Not Yet Explored .\u201d That\u2019s how Stern likes to begin telling the story of the Pluto mission and how scientists were motivated to better understand the dwarf planet\u2019s unique status in our solar system. Pluto, first discovered in 1930, is so far away that hardly any reliable data about it could make it to Earth. But in July 2015, on its 9-year, 3-billion-mile journey, New Horizons flew past Pluto. The spacecraft\u2019s high-resolution photos revealed its surprisingly complex geology: glaciers of nitrogen ice, avalanches, old traces of once-flowing rivers, volcanoes and mountain peaks some 11,000 feet tall. (The \u201cPluto Not Yet Explored\u201d stamp also traveled with the spacecraft as an onboard memento, setting a Guinness World Record for the farthest distance traveled by a stamp.) Advertisement New Horizons has continued phoning home data from the flyby, which ends this month. It will then continue its journey in the Kuiper Belt \u2015 the part of the solar system beyond Neptune\u2019s orbit \u2015 to reach another object some 1 billion miles beyond Pluto by 2019. About 95 percent of New Horizons data is already home, and scientists have learned about some major features in the icy world. \u201cWe were very surprised to find out that Pluto is still geologically alive,\u201d Stern said. \u201cIt has upended our ideas of how planetary geophysics works.\u201d Pluto is so small and so far from the sun that most scientists expected it to freeze beyond any chance of creating new geology today. Advertisement \u201cObviously that naive idea is incorrect. And Pluto proved that once and for all,\u201d Stern said. \u201cNow we\u2019re back at the drawing board, trying to figure out how small planets work.\u201d \u201cWe were very surprised to find out that Pluto is still geologically alive. It has upended our ideas of how planetary geophysics works.\u201d - Planetary scientist Alan Stern Pluto\u2019s complexity was another surprise. Most planetary bodies in the solar system have a few major feature types. Take the moon or Mercury. They\u2019re virtually all craters, with some mountain ranges created by cratering. Some less-typical planetary objects have five or six features. Pluto has a dozen more. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s just the whole package. For being so small, it\u2019s the most complex small planet that we\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s as complex as larger planets like Mars or the Earth,\u201d Stern said. Pluto has also uniquely engaged people. The mission\u2019s webpage received over 2 billion views in one day. The news of the flyby was on the front page of hundreds of newspapers. S pace people or scientists weren\u2019t the only ones interested in the Pluto mission, Stern says. It became part of the social fabric and, of course, an internet phenomenon. Now with 9000x more heart breaking. Advertisement That massive social engagement, Stern says, illustrates the mission\u2019s inspirational power. He\u2019s received letters and has had conversations with people after his talks and in the airport who share their fascination or tell him their kids now want to go into science and engineering. \u201cHopefully, this will inspire people to do even bigger things. Because there are so many big challenges to rid the world of poverty and pollution, and to do that, it\u2019s going to happen through technology. We need to inspire more people to go into tech careers to solve problems like these, and space exploration is one way to do that.\u201d New Horizons\u2019 goodbye image of Pluto, backlit by the sun as the spacecraft passes to the other side of the planet on July 15, 2015. NASAJHUAPLSWRL Advertisement Now that New Horizons is off to exploring other Kuiper Belt objects, Stern is expecting many more surprises. \u201cYou could not have predicted the amazing discoveries at Pluto, even though we have been to a couple of objects in the solar system that were at least a little analogous to Pluto,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been to anything like where we are going next, either. I don\u2019t make predictions, except to say to expect to see something wonderful.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I asked Stern what really went through his mind when he first saw there was a heart shape on Pluto . \u201cI was in a room where the data was being displayed, hot off the press, and one of our media people said it\u2019s heart-shaped. And I thought, \u2018Oh that\u2019s silly,\u2019\u201d he recalled. Advertisement \u201cBut then I looked up and saw that it really did look like a heart. We knew that would make Pluto a lot more approachable to the public. I mean, who can\u2019t like a heart?\u201d Stern continued. \u201cLike many aspects of this mission, the public participation was phenomenal \u2015 and I always say, \u2018Pluto did its part.\u2019\u201d This NASA photo of Pluto was made from four images by New Horizons' Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), combined with color data from the Ralph instrument.

Images Show That Saturn's North Polar Region Has Changed Color NASA wants to know why. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Oct 26, 2016, 10:53 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING NASA researchers are trying to figure out why Saturn\u2019s hexagonal north polar region has changed color over the past four years. Saturn\u2019s hexagon is a six-sided jet stream barrier, according to scientists, who have proposed various theories to explain its shape . Advertisement In one image NASA shared, from 2012, the hexagon appears to be bluish. But in another photo taken four years later, it looks golden. Images of Saturn's north polar hexagon, which appears bluish in 2012 and more golden in 2016. NASA Saturn\u2019s changing seasons and increased exposure to sunlight might have caused the color change, scientists theorize. Advertisement \u201cDuring the polar winter night between November 1995 and August 2009, Saturn\u2019s north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions \u2015 reactions involving sunlight and the atmosphere,\u201d NASA explained on its website. \u201cSince the planet experienced equinox in August 2009, the polar atmosphere has been basking in continuous sunshine, and aerosols are being produced inside of the hexagon, around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy today,\u201d the website stated. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Are 2 Small, Dark Moons Hiding In The Rings Of Uranus? The planet has 27 known moons. But are there more? By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Oct 18, 2016, 04:04 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A false-color image taken by Voyager shows the rings of Uranus. Astronomers believe they've found evidence of two previously unknown moons hidden in the rings. Space Frontiers via Getty Images Uranus might have a secret. A new analysis of data from the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which passed Uranus in 1986, revealed that two of the planet\u2019s rings have a telltale wavy pattern that could indicate the presence of a pair of small moons. These dark moons or \u201cmoonlets\u201d would be smaller than Manhattan \u2015 with diameters between just 2.5 and 8.5 miles \u2015 and orbit outside the alpha and beta rings: The alpha and beta rings, circled in this 1986 image taken by Voyager, could be hiding two very small moons. NASAJPL Advertisement \u201c These moons are pretty tiny ,\u201d Rob Chancia, one of the two University of Idaho researchers to make the discovery, told New Scientist. Chancia said the moons were so small that they wouldn\u2019t have been picked up by Voyager\u2019s cameras when the spacecraft passed Uranus three decades ago, coming within 50,600 miles of the planet\u2019s cloudtops. The moons also might have blended in with the rings. \u201cNot only are Uranus\u2019 rings dark, so are most of the little satellites that are in that region,\u201d Matthew Hedman, the other researcher involved in the discovery, told the magazine. Advertisement The two published their findings on arXiv.org . \u201cFuture Earth-based observations may be more likely to detect these moons\u201d than re-examining the Voyager images, Chancia and Hedman wrote in the article, which was accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal. Uranus and its rings seen in a false-color image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995. The rings are normally very dark.

Why This Newly Discovered Shark Is A Real Ninja The jet-black creature also glows in the dark. By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Dec 24, 2015, 11:07 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Several shark species have cool names, like great white , hammerhead , goblin and cookiecutter . Now, we have one more to add to the list. Meet the newest type of lanternshark : the ninja lanternshark. The species of lanternshark is the first of its kind ever found in Central American waters. Victoria V\u00e1squez Researcher Victoria V\u00e1squez and her colleagues discovered the previously unidentified shark after recovering its body from storage at the California Academy of Science . Advertisement It's the first lanternshark that's ever been found in Central American waters . V\u00e1squez said they were able to identify it as a lanternshark based on several characteristics. \"It had photophores (light emitting organs),\" she told The Huffington Post, \"two dorsal fins with a spine on each one, and dignathic heterodonty (upper teeth and lower teeth are different).\" V\u00e1squez said ninja lanternsharks live in the deep ocean. They have tiny dots that glow throughout their body, which, unlike most bioluminescent creatures , they use to camouflage themselves within the deep's limited light and sneak up on their prey. Advertisement Remind you of anything? Researcher Victoria V\u00e1squez's young cousins helped her come up with the inspiration for the name. Niko Guido via Getty Images The researchers gave the newly identified shark the scientific name of Etmoterus benchleyi, in homage to the creator of the film \"Jaws,\" Peter Benchley. But V\u00e1squez wanted its common name to be extra special, so she enlisted for helpher younger cousins, who are between the ages of eight and 14. Advertisement They went over a few names, including Left Shark Lanternshark and Super Ninja Shark, until finally settling on a name her colleagues would find more reasonable: Ninja Lanternshark. \"The common name we have suggested refers to the shark's color, which is a uniform sleek black as well as the fact that it has fewer photophores than other species of Lanternsharks,\" V\u00e1squez told HuffPost. \"We felt those unique characteristics would make this species stealthy like a ninja.\" The scientists are now hunting for other \"lost speciesof shark. Victoria V\u00c3\u00a1squez Advertisement The body of the Ninja Lanternshark that the researchers examined was originally caught in 2010 in the waters of Central America. However, it was sent to the academy for temporary storage where it remained \"unlooked at for five years,\" V\u00e1squez said. She is currently helping her colleague, professor Dave Ebert , identify the \"lost sharks\" that have yet to be described. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's Why Mirrors Seem To Flip Things Sideways But Not Upside Down WATCH: Why Mirrors Flip Things Sideways But Not Upside Down By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 18, 2015, 10:52 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT It's a simple question, but one that may never have occurred to you: why do mirrors seem to flip things horizontally but not vertically ? Or, in philosophical-mathematical terms, how can mirrors \"choose\" to flip an image along the x-axis but the not the y? That's the topic of a challenging new video from the Youtube series Physics Girl (above). \"If I raise my right hand, the mirrored me raises her left hand, but if I put my hand up in the air, she also puts her hand up, not down. So what's going on?\" host Dianna Cowern, a.k.a. \"Physics Girl,' says in the video. \"The mirror is flipping the image, but it's flipping it in the z-direction, that's what's causing all this confusion. If I could take my body and flip it through itself in the z-direction, I would get my mirror image.\" Advertisement Since our bodies are symmetrical, Cowern explains, we perceive ourselves as being flipped left and right. But we're actually being flipped front to back--like a glove getting turned inside out. Got it? See below for a video of Richard Feynman explaining the mirror paradox, once posed to the famous theoretical physicist by his fraternity brothers. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LEAVE A COMMENT It was not a particularly beautiful day today in New Haven, Connecticut. But everyone who gathered \u2015 some 2,000 strong \u2015 for the March for Science knew in advance that beautiful weather was unlikely. We knew it courtesy of meteorology, a science. An imperfect science, to be sure-but one we all count on just the same. Any time anyone checks a weather forecast, it\u2019s a vote for science. Despite the weather, I might have been dry and comfortable today courtesy of feathers, fur, or wool- had I been a duck, otter, or sheep- respectively. Those are adaptations, all, products of evolutionary biology and natural selection- which we understand courtesy of science. Advertisement Instead, I was comfortable and dry courtesy of Gore-Tex- a product of science. It was not a particularly beautiful day today in New Haven, Connecticut.

Despite the weather, I might have been dry and comfortable today courtesy of feathers, fur, or wool- had I been a duck, otter, or sheep- respectively. Those are adaptations, all, products of evolutionary biology and natural selection- which we understand courtesy of science. Instead, I was comfortable and dry courtesy of Gore-Tex- a product of science. Advertisement Those who gathered under those brooding skies were overwhelmingly, and inevitably, those already convinced that immunization saves countless lives and is not significantly associated with autism; that climate change is real and we are complicit in it; and that this planet\u2019s greatest treasure, its native biodiversity- is a product of evolution by natural selection over billions of years. Our mission at today\u2019s rally and march, I suggested, was to build bridges to those not marching with us- our neighbors, and coworkers, and cousins. Our mission was and is to build bridges that expand our reach and route of march, not burn bridges, and thus constrain them. I proposed reminding those not marching with us, every chance we get, that the ACT of every tweet- sending organized electrons through cyberspace- trumps the content of any tweet repudiating the basic merits of science. But for science, no one would find their way to cyberspace in the first place. Advertisement Every tweet is a vote for the products, power and practicability of the scientific method- and I asked those assembled to tweet, and retweet that. I ask those of you amenable to do the same. Some may be concerned that science is arrogant, and too sure of itself. But nothing could be further from the truth. Science is incredibly humble. It is riddled with doubt, and constantly prone to self-deprecation. It is all the stronger for it. As Bertrand Russell said: \u201c The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts .\u201d Good scientists are wise enough to know how much we don\u2019t know. The reason the best scientists sometimes lose out to hucksters in the court of public opinion is that the hucksters feign certainty, while the true scientists forever hedge. Science can be wrong, and acknowledges it can be wrong. But when it is wrong, what shows us the error, and the correction- is more science, not denial or alternative facts. Science is falsifiable, and verifiable- but always by more science, not by those who find the findings of science inconvenient. Advertisement It is despite the humility of science and the assault of doubt that truths are established beyond the shadows: gravity is real, climate change and our complicity in it are real, immunization saves countless lives, the earth is billions of years old, our solar system is heliocentric, evolution is real- and on a daily basis, science is repudiated by those using the endowment of its methods . It is not a given, incremental advance of science for which we marched- it is for the methods that fuel the advance, allowing all the while for the route to truth to be both hard and tortuous. So I asked those gathered today \u2013 and I ask you \u2015 to remind those not marching for this cause that the power, practicality, and proof of the scientific method are literally at everyone\u2019s texting fingertips \u2015 presidential and otherwise. -fin David L.

Antarctic Researchers Face Bitter Cold To Support The March For Science Scientists from the North and South poles joined the global movement. By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Apr 23, 2017, 03:03 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Some demonstrators who came out for the March for Science protests on Saturday faced rain and sloppy weather. Others faced elements much more severe. A team of German researchers showed their support for the pro-science protests by enduring below-freezing temperatures outside of their research lab in Antarctica on Saturday. Advertisement The researchers, who are with the Alfred Wegener Institute , are spending the upcoming Antarctic winter at the institute\u2019s Neumayer III research station . They took the photo below as a show of solidarity with protestors around the world and included a sign with a quote by Marie Curie , the Nobel Prize-winning chemist who discovered the elements radium and polonium. \u201cNothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood.

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Oct 5, 2016, 08:52 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT CBS Photo Archive via Getty Images Earthling Neil deGrasse Tyson celebrated his 58th birthday Wednesday. But had he been born elsewhere in the solar system, it would be a much different story. You see, \u201ca year\u201d is entirely relative . If Tyson lived on Saturn, for example, he\u2019d be just a toddler \u2015 and the world wouldn\u2019t be saying happy birthday at all. Advertisement As a gesture to the many fans who wished him well, Tyson on Wednesday penned a thank you that only the renowned astrophysicist could have dreamed up. As he did following the release of the new Star Trek movie , during the Rio Olympics , and in the wake of the Orlando mass shooting , Tyson took to Twitter. And in three short tweets, he threw the world\u2019s understanding of time for a loop. Thanks, Twitterverse, for all the birthday wishes. Today especially, I don\u2019t feel a day over 58. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 5, 2016 Advertisement Not that anybody asked, but on Mercury, I\u2019m 240 years old, and on Saturn, I\u2019m just 2. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 5, 2016 On Pluto, with its 248-year orbit around the Sun, birthdays are incompatible with human physiology. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) October 5, 2016 Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Troublesome Leak Grounds NASA's Next Mission To Mars Duct tape won't fix it apparently. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 23, 2015, 07:06 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Lest we forget, space travel remains an incredibly tricky endeavor. One day after SpaceX made history with an epic launch and vertical landing of its Falcon 9 rocket, bringing mankind one step closer to private space travel , NASA announced that it has suspended its upcoming mission to Mars -- because of a leak. The decision to ground the new Mars lander, dubbed InSight, follows unsuccessful attempts to repair the leak , which involves a key scientific instrument. \"We push the boundaries of space technology with our missions to enable science, but space exploration is unforgiving, and the bottom line is that we're not ready to launch in the 2016 window,\" John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, said in a statement. Advertisement An artist's rendering depicts the InSight lander studying the interior of Mars. NASA NASA / Reuters The InSight spacecraft -- the name is short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport -- was set to launch in March and arrive on Mars in late September. NASA said the \"terrestrial planet explorer\" will study Mars' interior and help scientists understand the processes that shaped the rocky planets of the inner solar system, including Earth, more than 4 billion years ago. The mission-delaying leak is in the seismometer , an instrument made by France's Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES) and designed to measure ground movements as tiny as the diameter of an atom. Advertisement \"It's the first time ever that such a sensitive instrument has been built,\" said Marc Pircher, director of CNES's Toulouse Space Centre. \"We were very close to succeeding, but an anomaly has occurred, which requires further investigation. Our teams will find a solution to fix it, but it won't be solved in time for a launch in 2016.\" The Associated Press reports that since the best opportunities for launching missions between Earth and Mars occur during a short window of time -- just a few weeks every 26 months -- InSight won't have another chance before May 2018. NASA officials said Tuesday that they must now decide whether the faulty instrument should be repaired or redesigned or whether the mission should be scrapped. So far, a reported $525 million has been spent on the $675 million mission. Advertisement The solar arrays on NASA's InSight lander are deployed during a test conducted in a clean room at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver. NASA/JPL-Caltech/Lockheed Martin The disappointing news for NASA comes in the wake of a triumph for billionaire Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. , or SpaceX. On Monday, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket into orbit , deployed 11 satellites, and then brought the 15-story booster back to Earth for a soft, vertical landing just six miles from where it took off at Cape Canaveral, Florida. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Astrophysicist: ETs May Have Already Lived And Died In Our Solar System The big question: Did they leave artifacts behind for us to find? By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost May 5, 2017, 09:44 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There's more than one way to look for signs of life from the distant past in our solar system. Adventtr via Getty Images As science continues to search the cosmos for evidence of intelligent extraterrestrials and, at the very least, for habitable planets that might harbor even non-intelligent life, one scientist is raising another eye-opening question: Was there a time in the far distant past when an advanced civilization actually lived on one of the planets of our solar system, long before earthlings evolved? Pennsylvania State University astrophysicist Jason T. Wright suggests that ancient aliens may have lived on nearby planets hundreds of millions of years ago, before vanishing without a trace. Advertisement In a new scientific paper, \u201cPrior Indigenous Technological Species,\u201d published in Cornell University\u2019s research archive, ArXiv , on April 24, Wright speculates: One of the primary open questions of astrobiology is whether there is extant or extinct life elsewhere in the solar system. Implicit in much of this work is that we are looking for microbial or, at best, unintelligent life, even though technological artifacts might be much easier to find. But if a prior technological, perhaps spacefaring, species ever arose in the solar system, it might have produced artifacts or other technosignatures that have survived to present day. Here, I discuss the origins and possible locations for technosignatures of such a prior indigenous technological species, which might have arisen on ancient Earth or another body, such as a pre-greenhouse Venus or a wet Mars. Advertisement HuffPost asked Wright how far back in time he thinks aliens might have lived in our solar system and if some of them may still be lingering out there. \u201cIt seems pretty clear there aren\u2019t any now. That\u2019s become more clear as we\u2019ve explored the solar system robotically. In terms of large, intelligent, technological civilizations, that seems pretty case closed,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. While Wright pays tribute to the imaginations that created tales of Martians and moon dwellers in his paper, he remained cautiously open-minded about what\u2019s possible in time and space. \u201cWhile the applications of this idea in science fiction are usually fanciful, it is unclear to what degree the existence of such species in reality is allowed or disallowed by evidence,\u201d he wrote. Advertisement In the interview, he said he thinks it\u2019s interesting to wonder if there could have been a previous species on Earth that used technology like we do and if there\u2019s any room in the geological or fossil record for that, or have we completely foreclosed it? \u201cMy guess is that we can rule out big swaths of the Earth\u2019s history. The farther back you go, the harder it is to rule something like that out. If they\u2019re very old, there may not be any traces. Things don\u2019t last long. If you put something in orbit around the sun, it\u2019ll be subject to collisions with asteroids and meteors. \u201cSo, anything, including planetary surfaces in the solar system, just gets constantly hit with these things. When you\u2019re on the surfaces of objects, like asteroids or moons or planets, those surfaces can also completely turn over, given enough time.\u201d Advertisement NASA defines astrobiology as \u201cthe study of the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe. This multidisciplinary field encompasses the search for habitable environments in our solar system and habitable planets outside our solar system.\u201d Wright told HuffPost of two important ingredients in looking for signs of life somewhere in space. \u201cIn the field of astrobiology, we talk about what are called biosignatures. If you look at a planet or a moon that has life on it, how would you know? What is the signature \u2015 the signal \u2015 that says this is life and not a completely sterile object? So, that\u2019s a biosignature. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Much Gold Is In An Oscar Statuette? At tonight's Oscars we'll no doubt see some familiar faces winning that coveted gold statuette. It's no secret that these sparkling little men aren't 100% gold--they're only coated in 24-carat gold--so that makes it harder to figure out how much gold they actually contain. Luckily math comes to the rescue. By Oscar E.

At tonight's Oscars we'll no doubt see some familiar faces winning that coveted gold statuette. It's no secret that these sparkling little men aren't 100% gold--they're only coated in 24-carat gold --so that makes it harder to figure out how much gold they actually contain. Luckily math comes to the rescue. Let's start with some data. The trophy's official height and weight are: 13.5 inches, and 8.5 pounds, respectively. So, it's basically a newborn baby (well, except that it's coated in gold, has a fit physique, and comes with a sword). This means that all we need to do is find the surface area of this golden baby. There are several formulas for doing so, but one developed by G.B. Haycock in 1978 has been shown to give good results: The output of this formula is in square meters, and \" W \" is the weight in kilograms and \" H \" the height in centimeters, so a little number-crunching is needed (I've put the details here ). The result? Our golden boy has a surface area of about... Advertisement 0.2 square meters, or 2.2 square feet. I think those numbers are hard to visualize, so here's some help. Stretch out your arm. Now bend your forearm to create an \"L.\" The length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of your middle finger is approximately 18 inches, or 1.5 feet. (This unit of length was widely used in ancient times; it's called a cubit .) And, since the square of 1.5 is 2.25, if you touch your elbow with the fingers on your other hand, the square you create (see below) has roughly the area of an Oscar statuette's gold-coated surface. Thus far we've only estimated the surface area of the statuette. If we knew the thickness of the gold coating we could estimate the volume of gold in an Oscar trophy. But, since the coating is probably a very thin layer, we'll just stop here. ( Edit : As a reader pointed out, average coatings are 15 millionths of an inch thick. Using this and the 2.2 square feet calculation gives about 0.0047 cubic inches of gold. That's about 1/500-th the volume of a golf ball.) So there you have it. Today's winners will be taking home armfuls of gold. For the rest of us, here's a recipe for Oscar cookies . Enjoy the show!

PAUL NURSE Sir Paul Nurse has just completed his five-year term as president of the Royal Society. The Nobel laureate and molecular biologist has been succeeded by Nobel laureate Sir Venkatraman \"Venki\" Ramakrishnan , who is a structural biologist . VENKATRAMAN RAMAKRISHNAN But Nurse, who will continue in his role as chief of Francis Crick Institute, has not left the Royal Society without first ensuring that the world's oldest scientific society remains relevant: a major Royal Society meeting in London has been called for November 7-9, 2016 on evolution paradigm shift with the understated working title, \" New Trends in Evolutionary Biology: Philosophical and Social Science Implications .\" The conference is being co-sponsored by the British Academy for the humanities and social sciences. While specific details of the event have not yet been announced, I'm told that many of the 50 or so scientists associated with The Third Way of Evolution -- who I call \" The Paradigm Shifters \" -- will attend, one commenting to me about the upcoming meeting: \"The bandwagon is therefore quite definitely rolling.\" Paul Nurse has been thinking about these matters for some time. As president of Rockefeller University, for example, he presided over a pivotal evolution symposium in 2008 --open to the public -- featuring Jack Szostak , Eugene Koonin et al. , and that summer at the World Science Festival said the following: Advertisement \"Maybe biology is on the edge of something similar to 1905 physics with the emerging complexity of biological systems -- in fact, a move from straight forward linear causality. And I wonder whether biology may go through a revolution in the coming decades.\" Nurse made these remarks about evolutionary biology during a conversation with me for a 2008 book interview : 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Does A touch B touch C touch D and so on. But, in fact, the nature of those interactions varies. Sometimes they just touch and do nothing. Sometimes they touch and turn into something else. Sometimes they touch and change another connection. Using simple network analogies, like transport networks for example -- it's not appropriate because it's not reflecting the biology. It's reflecting a man-made simplified interaction network. So we may need different language which could lead to different mathematics to describe this -- and that this is not going to be intuitive, to go back to an earlier point. We perhaps have to think, I've sometimes argued this, of better ways to move from the chemistry of life, which we're rather good at describing, into how that chemistry is translated into the management of information. . . .\" Nurse also told me he thought it was \"very important for science and scientists to be talking to the general public.\" Let's hope Venki Ramakrishnan feels the same way and that the Royal Society considers the Rockefeller University and 2013 NASA/Princeton Origins of Life conferences a precedent, invites the media and streams the proceedings over the Internet. . . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Science of <i>Jurassic World</i> As Horner explained in his 2009 book(and in his TED talk on de-extinction), you can turn on dormant genes to get them to build body parts, including a dino-like tail, snout and even teeth.

U.S. actors Bryce Dallas Howard, left, and Chris Pratt pose for photograpers as they arrive at the French premiere of U.S. movie Jurassic World in Paris, Friday May 29, 2015. (AP Photo/Remy de la Mauviniere) at the French premiere of U.S. movie Jurassic World in Paris, Friday May 29, 2015. (AP Photo/Remy de la Mauviniere) Jurassic World , which opens today, is a terrific film -- as good as the previous three in the franchise, including the first. I saw it in 3D, so my comparison is with the previous 2D versions, and it really comes to life in this format. But such dimensional matters aside, the plot is feasible enough to enable even the most skeptical viewer to willing suspend disbelief enough to accept the premise as plausible, which is the genetic engineering of a completely new type of dinosaur that never existed in the Jurassic. This was done under the advisement of the most famous dinosaur digger in the world, paleontologist Jack Horner, who has been the science advisor for the film franchise, including this latest installment. I've known Jack since the early 1990s when I first helped him dig up a dino on a site in Montana (it's much harder work to release the fossil treasure embedded in solid rock using dental picks than it appears in the film, in which workers easily brush away loose dirt with a small brush). When I arrived at Horner's camp I was surprised to come upon a patient historical scientist, sitting cross-legged before a cervical vertebrate from a 140-million year old Apatosaurus (formerly known as Brontosaurus ), wondering what to make of it. A reporter from a local paper asked Horner what this discovery meant for the history of dinosaurs. Did it change any of his theories? Where was the head? Was there more than one body at this site? Horner's answers were consistent with those of the cautious scientist: \"I don't know yet.\" \"Beats me.\" \"We need more evidence.\" \"We'll have to wait and see.\" Advertisement Horner's scientific thoroughness comes through on screen as the science behind Jurassic World paralleled that of his work on back-engineering a dinosaur from modern bird DNA because, we now know, there is no viable DNA available from the Jurassic period, not even left over inside Jurassic mosquitos embedded in amber, which was the premise of Michael Crichton's novel and Steven Spielberg's first film in the franchise, Jurassic Park . Instead, as Jack explained to me in an \"in conversation\" we had at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles a few days before the film was released, since we know dinosaurs evolved into birds, that means bird DNA contains the remnants of their dino ancestors. As Horner explained in his 2009 book How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to be Forever (and in his TED talk on de-extinction), you can turn on dormant genes to get them to build body parts, including a dino-like tail, snout and even teeth. Because of their availability, chickens work well, so Jack intends to build what he calls a \" Chickenosaurus .\" As he told me, \"If we can reinstate ancestral characteristics in a bird to make a dinosaur, you can't have ancestral characteristics unless you have an ancestor. That is proof of evolution.\" Advertisement As if anyone needs proof of evolution. Unfortunately they do, at least in America, so films like Jurassic World serve another purpose of value to those of us concerned about the state of U.S. science education (we're usually ranked toward the bottom of the most prosperous Western industrialized nations in the world): science education. Subtly, but poignantly, the science of Jurassic World sneaks in evolutionary biology without calling it that. Take Hen's teeth. We've known for decades how to turn on the ancestral genes for teeth in a chicken (see Stephen Jay Gould's 1983 book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes ), which would be impossible if all creatures were created in one brief burst of genesis six thousand years ago. Instead, genetic engineering is showing us how to find the genetic fossils of animal ancestry. This is now done through transgenics, as Horner explained to me: \"If you're going to try to make a dinosaur, transgenically is as good a way as finding ancestral genes. Transgenic dinosaurs are what we created in Jurassic World . We have a hybrid dinosaur that's a mixture of several types of dinosaurs, plus mixtures of genes from several types of animals.\" The result is one of the most terrifying monsters in monster film history: Indominus Rex, a mix of T-Rex and Velociraptor, with a few other features thrown in for good measure, such as the cuttlefish h ability to create camouflage to match nearly any background environment. Horner continued his explanation as I pressed him for details about how realistic any of this is: We will make the dino-chicken-like animal pretty soon. We're moving pretty quickly, but making a dinosaur that would look like a Velociraptor would take a lot longer. The more genes we learn about, what they do, and how to turn them on and off, the closer we come. All birds share a common ancestor. Once we have the technology, we think it'll work on any bird. Chickens just happen to be the easiest birds to come by. Jurassic World adds another feature not seen in the franchise before, and that is how to train a dinosaur. The film's hero employs the techniques used by animal trainers in venues like Sea World, so I asked Jack about this because these training techniques work on mammals. How would they work on reptilian creatures? We also know dinosaurs were social. For years, we've found dinosaur nesting grounds and evidence that they cared for their young. And birds live in social groups. That had to come from somewhere; I don't think they invented it on their own. We think of birds and reptiles as separate, but birds are dinosaurs, and therefore, reptiles. If you look at it genetically, crocodiles are closer to birds than lizards. But would they be intelligent enough to understand trainers' signals, such as the \"click\" system popular among Sea World trainers (as featured in the disturbing film Black Fish , about the training of Killer Whales)? Horner continued by puncturing yet another anthropocentrism: Advertisement This brings up the whole intelligence thing with dinosaurs and this side of that [evolutionary] tree. We're so mammal-centric. We think we're so smart; we're even mammal-centric about where our brain is located -- in our heads. Dinosaurs not only had a cranial brain, but a pelvic brain, enlarged ganglia that birds also have. If you add together the volume of the brain and ganglia, it's as high as most mammals. Parrots are really smart and we don't think of ducks as smart, and their brain/body ratios are about the same. In the first Jurassic Park film reference is made to a \"blood sucking lawyer,\" so that made me wonder about the legal aspect of a place like Jurassic World , that services 20,000 customers a day. Horner: We know that dinosaurs are not that scary. You could have dinosaurs on the Serengeti. As long as you keep your windows up, you could go on safari and look at them. They're not going to tear open your vehicle to get you. If you went to Jurassic Park, you'd see a whole bunch of dinosaurs sleeping. Animals also don't kill for fun. It's dangerous to kill another animal. You are putting you're life in danger. You could have Jurassic World at the L.A. Zoo. There's a lot worse things running up the freeway. Go see Jurassic World and learn some science, but mostly just have a good adventure because the film delivers that in spades.

People In High-Powered Jobs May Be Harder To Treat For Depression There could be a lot of explanations for this. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Oct 5, 2016, 02:02 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Terry Vine via Getty Images Depression may be harder to treat in people with high-status jobs than it is in people whose positions are on lower levels of the corporate ladder, a new study suggests. Researchers studied how 650 people in Belgium, Italy, Israel and Austria responded to treatments for depression . About half (56 percent) of the 336 patients with high-status jobs didn\u2019t experience fewer depressive symptoms after undergoing two rounds of different antidepressants and psychotherapy. About 40 percent of people with mid- to low-level jobs showed a poor response to the treatment, according to research presented last month at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress in Vienna. Advertisement Previous research and clinical trials have found that about one-third of people with depression generally don\u2019t respond to their first antidepressant treatment. Some see their symptoms improve after a second round with a different type of antidepressant, but a considerable number of patients remain treatment-resistant. The finding that high-status occupations are linked with a poorer chance of recovery is somewhat surprising. Most studies have looked at the prevalence of depression in different social classes, consistently finding that depression is more common among people with lower socioeconomic status. The new study suggests that even if people in occupations with higher status and wages are less likely to develop depression, they may be harder to treat when they do. \u201cA number of variables may explain these findings,\u201d co-author Siegfried Kasper , a psychiatrist at the Medical University of Vienna, said in a press statement. \u201cThere may be specific working environment demands and stressors; people may find it difficult to accept or cope with illness, or to continue with medication; or there may be other factors, related for example to cognitive, personality and behavioral differences.\u201d Advertisement Carol Landau, a clinical professor of psychiatry and medicine at Brown University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said she agrees that the stress of being a high executive could potentially explain the findings. \u201cWhen you have a high-status job, you are probably more exposed to a lot more stress and responsibility,\u201d she told The Huffington Post. \u201cAlthough it seems to me that if you are a woman taking care of her children alone that may involve even more stress.\u201d Sleep deprivation and personality traits may affect how people respond to treatment, Landau added. \u201cA lot of folks who are in high-status jobs are extremely perfectionistic,\u201d she said. \u201cMedication will help a lot of things \u2015 your appetite, sleep, concentration, and rumination to a certain extent \u2015 but it\u2019s not going to affect being self-critical.\u201d Advertisement A perfectionistic executive may base his or her self-worth on how well business goals are met, meaning professional failures could take a personal toll. \u201cThey\u2019d get into self-criticism. They don\u2019t say that \u2018maybe I didn\u2019t make that data point on dividend, but I\u2019m still a good person overall,\u2019\u201d Landau said. \u201cThey are so focused on the perfectionism that they sort of lose the forest for the trees, and so they might respond poorly to any sense of failure.\u201d Sleep is another factor that often gets overlooked in research but could influence how well people respond to treatment, Landau said. One recent study in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found that people who slept for two or more hours a night compared to their peers were twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. Advertisement \u201cI\u2019m willing to guess executives get less sleep than other people,\u201d Landau said. More research is needed to understand what factors truly drive the professional gap recovery. But for now, these findings suggest that clinicians may need to take into account the occupational level of their patients, the researchers said.
