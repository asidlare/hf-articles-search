'Falling Fruit' Map Helps Foragers Find Their Next Free Meal Who says nothing in life is free? By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Nov 26, 2015, 05:53 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Falling Fruit's interactive map lists more than 1,300 different types of free edibles in more than 790,000 locations around the world. Falling Fruit The ways we get our food these days sure have changed a lot, with technology dramatically affecting the way we catch or grow our next meal. So isn't it about time foraging was changed too? An interactive crowd-sourced map called Falling Fruit allows urban foragers to map out and review locations around the world where the public can find free fruits, vegetables and herbs growing in their area. Advertisement There are also listings for free markets and dumpsters that potentially contain edibles -- 2,181 dumpsters, to be exact. Falling Fruit The volunteer-run nonprofit, based out of Boulder, Colorado, currently boasts 1,317 different types of edibles in more than 790,443 locations. Advertisement The U.S. easily has the most posts, with 465,000 locations flagged on the west coast -- most being in southern California and Washington state -- and 310,000 in the Northeast. Outside the U.S., western Europe has the second most locations with 12,000 listings, followed by 2,000 in Australia, 115 off Africa\u2019s south-east coast, 93 in northern Argentina, 79 in Thailand and 18 in Finland. \u201cSome of the best mangoes in Panama!\u201d one review for a mango tree along the Panama Canal reads. Some people include photos of the food they find, like this person who provided a review on apples found north of London, England. Falling Fruit Advertisement A review for a mango tree on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean reads: \u201cThe tree is right beside the road, mangos on the floor. Watch out for the ants, they really bite!\u201d According to the website\u2019s public database , the most common plants listed are honey locust trees, followed by small-leaved linden, sugar maple, cherry plum and ginkgo trees. There are also more recognizable food items listed, like apples, pears, cherries, olives, pecans, and even places to find fish. Advertisement The website, which launched in 2013, states that its goal is to offer \"not just a free lunch\" but to \"facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods.\" It advises that the map won\u2019t be 100 percent accurate, but that\u2019s why they encourage the public to help with its edits and reviews. Some users even share photos of their finds. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Your Cell Phone Could Soon Predict Whether You'll Get The Flu A new study harnesses college students' cell phone mania to track the spread of illness. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 20, 2015, 01:18 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Bloomberg via Getty Images Cell phones track our every move. A privacy advocate might see this as a problem. But an epidemiologist like Dr. Allison Aiello of the University of North Carolina sees it as an opportunity. Aiello, along with researchers from across the country, recently published a paper showing that data from cell phones can be harnessed to identify people who are likely to contract the flu -- giving epidemiologists a potentially game-changing new tool in the fight against a disease that kills thousands of Americans every year. Advertisement \"We believe this serves as a window into the future of epidemiological data collection,\" Aiello told The Huffington Post. Her colleagues agree. \"I think that the development of these kinds of models for medical data, where we can now collect data more frequently or in a more personalized manner, [for example by] using cell phones, is extremely important,\" Duke statistician Katherine Heller, a co-author on the paper, said in an email. During the 2013 flu season, the study's authors gave 103 undergrads living in six University of Michigan dorms cell phones loaded with an app that used Bluetooth to record when they came into contact with one another. The undergrads also filled out a weekly online survey to report health-related behaviors, social interactions and flu symptoms. Anyone who reported flu symptoms was then tested for the flu virus. Advertisement This allowed the researchers to identify who contracted the flu after coming in contact with someone else in the cohort with the flu -- and what differentiated those people from others who did not contract the flu after such contact. They also monitored how long it took for people infected with the flu to recover. They then used statistical analysis to develop an algorithm that predicts an individual's chance of becoming sick after exposure to the virus, based on behaviors such as sleep, drinking and smoking and personal traits such as sex, age and vaccination status. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The specifics of the algorithm aren't particularly surprising. People who drink and smoke are more susceptible to the flu and take longer to recover, while the opposite is true of those with good sleep and exercise habits. What makes the tool unusual, though, is that it takes all these factors into account at once to figure out each individual's likelihood of getting sick on any particular day. Advertisement Other researchers had previously built similar models, but they relied people self-reporting whom they'd interacted with -- which is highly prone to error -- rather than the direct observations that the cell phone data permitted. The group studied by the researchers was too small and homogenous for the algorithm to be useful on a broad scale. But the researchers said they hoped this study would pave the way for more research that could lead to an algorithm that could predict anyone's chances of getting the flu -- allowing people to take measures that will keep them from getting sicker.

Mercury Crossing The Sun For The First Time In A Decade It may be small, but Mercury takes center stage in the solar system this week. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost May 8, 2016, 08:02 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Mercury and the sun have begun to dance in a rare astronomical phenomenon you won't want to miss. In what's known as a planetary transit , the solar system's smallest planet will appear as a tiny black spot slowly crossing the face of our star. It's the first time the event has occurred in a decade, and those who miss it will have to wait until 2019 for the next opportunity. Advertisement On Mon., Mercury will transit the sun. Discover more & find out how you can watch it happen: https://t.co/KfYKM8crBC pic.twitter.com/bBwfSgFzcf \u2014 NASA (@NASA) May 6, 2016 The 7.5-hour transit runs from 7:12 a.m. EDT, when Mercury will \" start to make a tiny dent in the sun's disk ,\" and until 2:42 p.m. It will be visible in its entirety across the U.S. East Coast, as well as in South America, western Europe and western Africa, according to NASA. Those located in Western U.S. states will be able to view it after sunrise. It won't be visible to the naked eye. If you don't have your own gear, don't worry. NASA will be streaming the transit live on NASA TV and its Facebook page . You can also watch it live in the video above, courtesy of the robotic telescope company Slooh. Advertisement As the planet makes its \" leisurely journey across the face of the sun ,\" it will appear 1/158 the size of the sun, according to NASA. \"Astronomers get excited when any two things come close to each other in the heavens,\" Louis Mayo, program manager at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement. \"This is a big deal for us.\" Skywatchers in Western Europe, South America and eastern North America will be able to see the entirety of the transit. The entire 7.5-hour path across the sun will be visible across the Eastern U.S. -- with magnification and proper solar filters -- while those in the West can observe the transit in progress at sunrise. NASA Advertisement Mercury transits the sun roughly 13 or 14 times per century. The last one occurred in 2006 , with the next two not until Nov. 11, 2019, and Nov. 13, 2032. For those observing Monday's event with their own telescope, NASA offers these important safety tips : \"Use only a commercially available safe solar filter covering the sky-end of a telescope or both sky-ends of a pair of high power binoculars to observe the transit. Sunglasses and crossed polarizers are not dark enough to save your retina from burns and permanent scarring. Low-power binoculars won't have enough magnification to show tiny Mercury. The transit is NOT visible to the naked eye and cannot be detected through standard solar viewing glasses.\" Advertisement In advance of Mercury's exciting day in the spotlight, NASA released the first global topographic model of the solar system's innermost planet on Friday. It may be small, but Mercury is taking center stage this week. The most complete topo map of Mercury was part of the final data dump from MESSENGER: https://t.co/SHSH1ILUFu pic.twitter.com/1M9BAhLnsF \u2014 Discover Magazine (@DiscoverMag) May 6, 2016 Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Sakurajima Volcano Shoots Out Lava, Ash And Lightning During Eruption \"I'm not scared because I'm used to it.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Feb 7, 2016, 11:42 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Adding lightning to a volcanic eruption will make it either more impressive or more terrifying, depending on how close you are when it happens. On Friday, Japan's Sakurajima erupted, with explosive blasts of lava accompanied by bursts of volcanic lightning: Advertisement It's even more impressive/terrifying up close and in slow motion: No one was injured during the eruption, but the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded its alert from level 2 to level 3, warning people not to approach the volcano , which is roughly 32 miles from the Sendai nuclear power plant. Advertisement The previous alert level forbid people from approaching the crater. Volcanic lightning is caused by friction when a large amount of ash bursts from a volcano and the particles rub together in the air , according to National Geographic. As a result, lightning is rare in eruptions that don't release much ash. Sakurajima sits in Kagoshima Bay, looming over Kagoshima City , whose 600,000 residents often endure plumes of ash during its regular activity. For them, Friday's eruption was just another day living in the shadow of one of the world's most active volcanoes. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Dressing Better Can Change The Way Your Brain Works How The Clothing You Wear Affects The Way You Think By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post May 2, 2015, 07:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NEW YORK, NY - MARCH 10: Barrister Amal Clooney and actor George Clooney attend The 100 LIVES initiative, to express gratitude to the individuals and institutions whose heroic actions saved Armenian lives during the Genocide 100 years ago, on March 10, 2015 in New York City. The program, led by Ruben Vardanyan, Vartan Gregorian and Noubar Afeyan, establishes the Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity as a means to empower modern-day saviors. During the event, the group reiterated the need to combat genocide and advance human rights efforts. (Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for 100 LIVES) Many modern offices, especially in creative fields, are pretty laissez faire when it comes to the dress code. Jeans and a T-shirt are often considered more appropriate attire than a buttoned-up suit or a dress with heels. But new research suggests a surprising advantage to dressing up for the workday. Wearing more formal clothing changes the way that people think, helping them to focus on the big picture, according to a study recently published in the journal Social Psychological & Personality Science. Advertisement The study, which was conducted by researchers at Columbia University and California State University, Northridge, found that clothing had a significant impact on cognitive processing style. More formal clothing resulted in more abstract cognitive processing. \"Wearing formal clothing leads to more big-picture thinking, rather than concrete thinking that focuses on the details,\" study co-author Michael Slepian, a postdoctoral research scholar at Columbia Business School, explained to The Huffington Post. The researchers asked a group of college-age volunteers of both genders to complete tests designed to determine their cognitive processing style at that moment. Before some of the tests, the volunteers ranked the formality of what they had opted to wear. With other tests, the volunteers were specifically directed to put on \"clothing you would wear to class\" or \"clothing you would wear for a job interview.\" Across a series of experiments, those wearing the more formal outfits exhibited broader, more holistic thinking. Advertisement Why did changes in clothing lead to changes in how people thought? \"Formal clothing made people feel more powerful, which in turn made them more likely to adopt high-level, abstract thinking,\" Slepian said, pointing out that \"the suit is a symbol of power.\" He also noted that \"formal clothing might improve your mood if you feel good in the clothing and think it looks good.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Fake Meat May Change Our Future Thanksgiving Dinners Even if you're not a vegetarian, we might all be eating fake meat by 2050. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 26, 2015, 09:29 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT If you've ever had a vegetarian at your Thanksgiving dinner you know the drill: when the turkey comes to the table so does the tofurkey -- that rotund, strange, turkey alternative. While it may not appeal to the masses, meat alternatives such as tofu and seitan are good for the environment and may be necessary when the demand for meat outstrips the production of livestock, according to a new video (above) released by the American Chemical Society on Monday. Advertisement What are food chemists and other scientists doing to make fake meat taste as good as the real thing? Just watch the video to find out. Happy Thanksgiving!

Candle Soot May Be The Key To A Better Battery For Electric Cars The discovery could also help us fight pollution and global warming. By Lila Shapiro Senior Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post Oct 8, 2015, 09:49 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Can candle soot help to power electric cars? Peter Dazeley via Getty Images It sounds like something that Harry Potter might have bought himself as a reward for defeating the most powerful dark wizard who ever lived -- a car powered by candles. The new discovery , by Chandra Shekhar Sharma and Manohar Kakunuri of the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India, doesn\u2019t quite involve putting actual candles under the hood of a car. But it does describe how combining two very different innovations could help combat a force even darker than Voldemort: pollution and global warming caused by gas-burning vehicles. Advertisement Candle soot, a simple and inexpensive material, might be able to power batteries used in plug-in hybrid electric cars, Sharma and Kakunuri have discovered. Sharma was intrigued by candle soot since a 2011 study revealed that it repelled water. On a whim, he and his team tested the soot to see how well it conducted electricity. What the researchers found surprised them: electric currents traveled more efficiently through candle soot than they did through most of the carbon materials that are currently used in commercial batteries. The soot contains interconnected carbon nanoparticles that are well-suited as a conducting material for a powerful battery, and a huge amount of them can be produced by doing nothing more sophisticated or elaborate than burning a candle. This doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ll be able to run your car off of candles -- at least, not any time soon -- but the implications are exciting. Electric cars are very expensive, and the batteries are a big part of the reason behind that. In 2013, Alan Mulally, who was then CEO of Ford, let slip that the battery packs for his company\u2019s Focus electric car cost between $12,000 and $15,000 apiece. B atteries are also time-consuming to build and don\u2019t last very long. Advertisement For years now, scientists around the world have been racing to invent a more powerful and cheaper battery. As Andrew C. Revkin put it in The New York Times, \u201c The stakes are simple, and enormous. A cheap, capacious battery is widely seen as a linchpin to a new clean-energy economy in which mobility and electricity are no longer reliant on fossil fuels.\u201d The study is a breakthrough in \u201cexploring the full potential of candle soot,\u201d Sharma wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. But he seems to be underselling it: It could also mark an important step towards making electric cars available for the masses. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These Personality Traits Could Put You At Risk For Social Media Addiction These Personality Traits Could Put You At Risk For Social Media Addiction Rachael Rettner \u2014 Live Science Mar 14, 2018, 10:59 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Shutterstock Whether it\u2019s scrolling through Instagram or constantly refreshing your Facebook feed, social media can eat up hours of your day. But if you find it particularly hard to stay away from social media, your personality may be partly to blame. According to a new study, people with certain personality traits are more likely to develop a social media addiction. Advertisement \u201cThere has been plenty of research on how the interaction of certain personality traits affects addiction to things like alcohol and drugs,\u201d study co-author Isaac Vaghefi, an assistant professor of information systems at Binghamton University in New York state, said in a statement . But relatively few studies have looked at how personality traits may affect tech addiction, including addiction to social media, the researchers said. [ 7 Signs Your Child Is an iPad Addict ] In the new study, the researchers surveyed about 300 college students to assess their personality and gauge their level of addiction to the social media site each individual used most frequently. (Questions to measure social media addiction included: \u201cI sometimes neglect important things because of my interest in this social networking website\u201d; \u201cWhen I am not using this social networking website, I often feel agitated\u201d; and \u201cI have made unsuccessful attempts to reduce the time I interact with this social networking website.\u201d) The study found that three personality traits in particular \u2014 neuroticism , conscientiousness and agreeableness \u2014 were related to social media addiction. Two other personality traits, extraversion and openness to experience, weren\u2019t linked with social media addiction. Advertisement Specifically, the researchers found that people with high levels of neuroticism, or the tendency to experience negative emotions such as stress and anxiety, were more likely to develop addiction to social media , compared with people who had low levels of neuroticism. In contrast, people with high levels of conscientiousness, or the tendency to have impulse control and a strong drive to achieve specific goals, were less likely to develop addiction to social media. However, the researchers noted that even people with high conscientiousness could be prone to social media addiction if they were also high in neuroticism. This may be because high levels of stress and anxiousness could override a person\u2019s perceived control over their social media use, the researchers said. Advertisement In addition, the trait of agreeableness \u2014 or the degree to which someone is friendly, empathetic and helpful \u2014 by itself had no effect on social media addiction. But this was not true when the researchers looked at agreeableness in combination with conscientiousness. They found that people with low levels of both agreeableness and conscientiousness were more likely to develop social media addiction than people with average levels of these personality traits. But surprisingly, people with high levels of both of these personality traits were also more likely to develop social network addiction, compared to people with average levels of the two traits. It\u2019s possible that people who have high levels of both agreeableness and conscientiousness make a conscious decision to use social networks more, in order to help their friendships flourish, the researchers said. Advertisement It\u2019s important to note that because the study involved a few hundred college students at a single university, more research is needed to confirm the findings, the researchers said. But they added that the findings could have implications for those who treat tech addictions. \u201cOur findings explain that users with higher levels of IT addictions may not be considered as one homogeneous group of users, as different personality traits can play different roles in users\u2019 dispositions toward IT addiction,\u201d the researchers wrote in their paper , which was presented in January at the 51st Hawaii International Conference on Systems Science. Vaghefi added that he hopes the findings will encourage people to look at the \u201cwhole picture\u201d of how personality traits affect tech addiction, \u201crather than just focusing on one personality trait\u201d at a time.

The Mystery Of Alaska's Sea Otter Deaths Continue To Baffle Scientists \"It\u2019s scary to know there\u2019s something out there in the wild that we may or may not be able to do anything about.\" By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 26, 2015, 04:32 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT More than 250 dead or dying sea otters have washed ashore in the Kachemak Bay area in Alaska this year. Credit: Associated Press An unusually high number of sick or dying sea otters has washed onto the shores of Alaska\u2019s southern coast this year. But despite the efforts of many baffled scientists to find an answer, the exact cause of the die-off remains unknown. More than 250 sick or dead sea otters have turned up on beaches in the Kachemak Bay region this year. Joel Garlich-Miller, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told Hakai Magazine that this number is more than double 2014\u2019s -- which had already been a \u201chigher than average\u201d figure. Advertisement Based on the symptoms of the otters that have been found, scientists believe something peculiar may be plaguing the animals. Preliminary tests suggest that toxins from harmful algal blooms and infections caused by bacteria might be contributing to the otter deaths; but given the spike in morbidity, another as-yet-unknown factor is also suspected. \u201cSomething is hitting them harder and faster , in addition to the disease that we\u2019re familiar with seeing, something else seems to be involved,\u201d Marc Webber of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told Alaska Public Media last month. \u201cThat\u2019s just speculation, we don\u2019t have any evidence yet, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing on the beach.\u201d Compounding this mystery, reports say that while some dead otters were found emaciated, indicative of a long illness; some of them appear to have died suddenly at a healthy weight, which is \u201ceven more curious,\u201dAlaska SeaLife Center veterinarian Carrie Goertz told Hakai Magazine. Advertisement These seemingly healthy otters act paralyzed, or \u201cseize\u201d up just before death , reports Homer News. Kachemak Bay is home to about 6,000 sea otters. Since the marine mammals play a critical role in their ecosystems, experts say the mass die-off is likely a sign that the entire ecosystem is being impacted by something harmful. In October, the Alaska SeaLife Center and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in a press release that a team of experts had launched an investigation into the spike in otter deaths in the area. So far, scientists say they have a few ideas as to what\u2019s causing the animals to fall sick; but nothing concrete has been determined. Advertisement Kathy Burek, a veterinary pathologist, told Hakai Magazine that she believes the bacterium Streptococcus infantarius subspecies coli may be one of the culprits. However, as the bacterium is quite typical in this population of otters, she suspects \u201cthere may be something else going on that\u2019s making these infections more deadly.\u201d \u201cAny time you have a disease process occurring at an unusual rate, even if it\u2019s a known disease process, you want to figure out what\u2019s different, what\u2019s causing it to increase so much,\u201d Burek said. Burek suspects that a mystery virus may be to blame. She said, however that is could take \u201cweeks or months\u201d to figure out if this is true. Advertisement Halley Werner, a supervisor at the Alaska SeaLife Center, told KTVA.com in October that the spate of the sea otter deaths has unnerved her. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to know there\u2019s something out there in the wild that we may or may not be able to do anything about,\u201d she said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

One Trick That Could Help You With 'Mindful Eating' A new study helps to explain why listening to your food while chewing can make you eat less. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 21, 2016, 10:28 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Hearing your own food while chewing can reduce how much you eat, scientists say. Pascal Broze/Getty Images Hearing the sounds of chewing and slurping may be annoying to some of us, but listening to your own food while chewing can actually help to curb your appetite. That's according to new research, slated to be published in the July edition of the journal Food Quality and Preference , which suggests that the sounds of eating can have a significant effect on how much food we consume. Advertisement \"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\" Dr. Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at Brigham Young University\u2019s Marriott School of Management and a co-author of the research, said in a statement . \"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\" The research included three separate experiments -- one of which involved 71 undergraduate students who were presented with a bowl of 10 pretzels and were equipped with headphones to wear while they ate the pretzels. Some of the participants heard loud ambient sounds in the headphones, which masked the sound of chomping on the pretzels. Others heard low ambient sound, so that their own chewing was still audible. Advertisement It turned out that when the participants could better hear the sound of their food while chewing, they ate less compared with those who listened to loud ambient sound, Dr. Gina Mohr, assistant professor of marketing at Colorado State University's College of Business and a co-author of the research, told The Huffington Post on Friday. Participants who listened to louder ambient noise ate four pretzels on average while those in the \"quiet\" group ate fewer than three pretzels on average. \u201cMindful eating is the practice of giving your attention to the experience of eating, while shutting out other distracting stimuli.\"\u201d - Dr. Gina Mohr, co-author of the new research Advertisement The researchers concluded that intrinsic sounds may be an overlooked part of the eating experience, and they may play a key role in why \"mindful eating\" often leads to eating less. \"Mindful eating is the practice of giving your attention to the experience of eating, while shutting out other distracting stimuli,\" Mohr said. \"This research points to the food\u2019s sound as an anchor to which consumers can focus.\" Giving your attention to eating includes focusing all of your senses, from taste to smell to touch to sight to, yes, even sound. Advertisement \"When you mask the sound of consumption, like when you watch TV while eating, you take away one of those senses and it may cause you to eat more than you would normally,\" Elder said in the statement. \"The effects may not seem huge -- one less pretzel -- but over the course of a week, month, or year, it could really add up.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Polls of Future Past: A History of Public Expectations for the Future of Science Science fiction sometimes barely beats out science fact as technological advancements rapidly transform the world. But the changes that are anticipated aren't always the ones that arrive. Here's a look back at what the polls tell us the public has expected from scientific progress -- and how often they've been disappointed.

Science fiction sometimes barely beats out science fact as technological advancements rapidly transform the world. But the changes that are anticipated aren't always the ones that arrive. Here's a look back at what the polls tell us the public has expected from scientific progress -- and how often they've been disappointed. From the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archives: Reality Outpacing Expectations: The Moon Landing When Gallup first asked Americans in 1949 whether they expected man to reach the Moon in the next 50 years, only 15 percent said yes. Despite the shocking power of new wartime technologies like the atom bomb, the public remained skeptical about the idea of space travel. Just six years later the proportion saying man would be on the Moon in 50 years more than doubled. By 1959, after the launch of the first satellite, more than half the country expected a Moon landing within just 20 years. Advertisement The Moon landing was somewhat atypical of the way that scientific progress and public perceptions normally interact, in that acceleration in perception kept step fairly well with technological progress. The space race instigated by the Russian launch of Sputnik focused public attention on the major government efforts in this area, which may have brought public perceptions in line with scientific developments. But even with building conviction of success on the part of the public, a significant proportion found the idea of an impending moonwalk inconceivable even just a few years before mankind made its giant leap. Expectations Outpacing Reality: A Cure for Cancer In contrast, the public has been all too willing to believe that a cure for cancer is imminent. The strong majorities who anticipated a cure well before the end of the 20th century were disappointed, though great advancements in treatment and life expectancy were made. Despite failure up to this point, most Americans are still positive about the prospects of a cure, particularly looking forward 50 years or more. The (Medical) Future Looks Bright When asked in a 1998 NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll whether a cure for cancer, a cure for AIDS, a cure for diabetes, a cure for Alzheimer's or a cure for heart disease was most likely to be found in the next 20 years, a cure for cancer was chosen by a plurality of 37 percent, with a cure for AIDS the second-most-chosen option at 20 percent. However, this finding should not lead to the conclusion that optimism about cancer is atypical. Additional data indicate that the public has great faith in the future of medical science in nearly all areas. A 2001 Alliance for Aging Research/Belden Russonello & Stewart poll found that majorities had some or a great deal of confidence that cures would be found in their lifetimes for not just cancer (71 percent) but diabetes (79 percent), Parkinson's disease (73 percent), and Alzheimer's (71 percent). Advertisement Remarkably high numbers have predicted significant medical progress on other fronts as well. In a 1996 PSRA/ Newsweek poll Americans said that by 2006, they expected to see \"grown\" replacement human organs (57 percent), the ability to control weight by manipulating the fat gene (58 percent), and a male birth-control pill (80 percent). A 1999 CBS News poll found even higher expectations for the coming century, including the ability to clone humans (74 percent) and genetically engineer babies (85 percent). And a 1998 Gallup poll found that 61 percent of Americans thought that within just 25 years, most people would routinely live to 100 years. However, one particular medical mystery elicits pessimism. In a 1965 Gallup poll 48 percent believed a cure for the common cold would be found within 20 years. After that deadline had passed, a 1989 Gallup poll found that just 23 percent expected a cure by the year 2000. In 1998 an NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll found less than half (45 percent) saying a cure would be found in the new century. Advertisement Teleporters, Dodos, and Compact Discs Outside the medical sphere, Americans' predictions for the future are less consistently skewed in the direction of innovation. Majorities in a 1999 CBS News poll thought that many current technologies were likely to still be in use at the end of the 21st century, including the Internet (79 percent), printed books (68 percent), and telephones (57 percent), while significant numbers expected the continuation of post office mail (44 percent) and even compact discs (37 percent). A National Consumers League poll in the same year found that 63 percent believed computers and telephones would be wireless by 2020, but 37 percent were skeptical. Though many may expect today's technologies to avoid obsolescence, a considerable share of the public also foresee science-fiction standbys becoming reality within the next few decades. A 2010 Pew poll found that 42 percent thought over the next 40 years, computers would probably or definitely be able to read people's thoughts by scanning their brains, and 51 percent thought extinct species would be cloned. A 2014 Pew poll found that 41 percent believed a way to teleport objects would probably or definitely have been found within the next 50 years. Forty percent in a 2010 CBS News poll thought conclusive proof of extraterrestrial life would arrive within 20 years, and the same number thought people would be taking vacations in space in the 21st century. However, only about half of these would want to go -- still more than the 9 percent who, back in 1955, expressed a desire to be on that first trip to the then-impossibly distant Moon.

Beethoven May Have Composed Masterpieces To His Own Irregular Heartbeat Beethoven May Have Composed Masterpieces To His Own Irregular Heartbeat By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 11, 2015, 10:59 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Many who listen to Beethoven's masterpieces would describe them as deeply heartfelt -- and according to new research , this description may be surprisingly apt. The unusual rhythms found in some of Beethoven's most iconic works may be linked to the heart condition cardiac arrhythmia, which he is suspected to have had, research from the University of Michigan and University of Washington suggests. Advertisement In a new paper published in the journal Perspectives in Biology and Medicine , the researchers -- a cardiologist, a medical historian and a musicologist -- investigated the link between the German composer's likely heart condition and his music. \"We started thinking about the ways that somebody's physical illnesses and physical body could manifest in the music they were making,\" one of the study's co-authors, Dr. Joel Howell, a medical historian and professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan, told The Huffington Post. The researchers examined the rhythmic patterns of a number of Beethoven's compositions for clues of this condition, and indeed found that the rhythms of certain sections of his famous works reflect the irregular rhythms of cardiac arrhythmia. Advertisement \u201cWhen your heart beats irregularly from heart disease, it does so in some predictable patterns,\" Howell said in a written statement . \"We think we hear some of those same patterns in his music.\u201d Cardiac arrhythmia can cause the heart to beat too slow, too fast or with an irregular beat. The researchers found that unexpected changes of pace and keys -- such as the intense final movement \u201cCavatina\u201d in Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet in B-flat Major, Opus 130 -- appeared to match these patterns. Arrhythmic patterns were also detected in iconic pieces like the Piano Sonata in A-flat major, Opus 110. Historians and physicians have substantial inferential evidence to suggest that Beethoven suffered from heart disease, in addition to a host of other maladies, including irritable bowel syndrome and syphilis. Many of the maladies Beethoven was known to suffer from have been found to contribute to an irregular heartbeat, Howell explained. Advertisement According to the paper's authors, Beethoven's deafness could have made him even more sensitive to the rhythm of his own heartbeat, which is perhaps why it was so influential for his music. But Beethoven isn't the only famous artist who may have had a medical condition that deeply affected his work. Claude Monet experienced vision problems and was diagnosed with cataracts in the later years of his life. Around the age of 65, he began experiencing changes in his perception of color -- and at this time, his paintings shifted towards muddier colors. After he was diagnosed with cataracts at age 72, Monet's work became noticeably more abstract. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These Award-Winning Videos Prove The Micro World Is Just As Beautiful As Our Own Macro Realm 12 GIFs That Prove Our World Is Even More Beautiful Than It Seems By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 29, 2015, 08:59 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Things moving around on the micro level are simply mesmerizing. To see for yourself, just check out the videos (below) that were recently named the year's best in Nikon's annual Small World in Motion Photomicrography Competition . The winning videos offer a very up-close look at happenings that seem mundane on the surface -- from the development of a fish's inner ear to crystals forming -- but are anything but mundane under a microscope. The competition showcases some of the best micro-videography from around the world , and this year more than 130 entries were vying for top honors. The entries were judged by Dr. Paul Maddox, assistant professor of biology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Check out the top three winning videos below -- and nine honorable mentions.

Researchers Created A Machine That Pukes... For Science, Of Course \"This machine may seem odd, but it\u2019s helping us understand a disease that affects millions of people.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Aug 20, 2015, 05:13 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It's a study that's going viral ... in every sense. Researchers at North Carolina State University and Wake Forest University have created a machine that vomits to help show how norovirus spreads. That's a fast-moving infection known for causing vomiting and diarrhea, and which can be severe and even deadly. Advertisement The new device is designed to help researchers better understand how the infection spreads when someone throws up. More importantly, the vomit machine shows how much of the virus becomes aerosolized and moves through the air, landing on nearby people and surfaces. The puking apparatus features a small face (about one-quarter the size of a normal human face) inside a plexiglass box connected to a simulated esophagus and stomach. As Grace Tung-Thompson, a recent Ph.D. graduate fromNorth Carolina State University and lead author of the study demonstrates in the video above, a turn of a lever causes the little face to puke, with researchers able to control the volume, viscosity and pressure to simulate different degrees of hurling. Advertisement Instead of real vomit, the researchers used vanilla Jell-O in their study. And instead of actual norovirus, they used a similar virus called bacteriophage MS2 that doesn't cause illness. According to the study, published in the journal PLOS One, just 0.02 percent of the virus becomes aerosolized -- but that's more than enough to spread the disease and make people sick. \u201cWhen one person vomits, the aerosolized virus particles can get into another person\u2019s mouth and, if swallowed, can lead to infection,\u201d Lee-Ann Jaykus, a professor of food, bioprocessing and nutrition sciences at NC State and co-author of the study said in a news release. Advertisement \"[T]hose airborne particles could also land on nearby surfaces like tables and door handles, causing environmental contamination,\" she said. \"And norovirus can hang around for weeks, so anyone that touches that table and then puts their hand to their mouth could be at risk for infection .\" The researchers hope to next study how long the particles remain in the air, and how far they can spread. Norovirus is sometimes referred to as the \"cruise ship virus\" as there have been a number of outbreaks at sea. The closed environment of ships allows the infection to spread rapidly. Advertisement The virus is also known to be passed around in healthcare facilities, catered events, hotels, schools and other places where people are in close contact with each other. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus causes some 20 million infections per year, and contributes to between 56,000 and 71,000 hospitalizations annually. The virus also causes up to 800 deaths yearly in the United States. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Dinner Party 101: In Which Ann Meets Dr. Skeptic, Part 1 it is possible to engage people who reject or doubt the established scientific consensus without starting World War III or surrendering your self-respect. It's even possible to change people's minds -- at leastpeople's minds,of the time. By Ann Reid, Contributor Executive  Director, NCSE Executive  Director, NCSE Apr 29, 2015, 04:13 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. We've all been there: Thanksgiving dinner with that uncle -- the outspoken climate-change-denier (\"Please, it was so cold this winter!\"); a phone call with an anti-vaxxer friend (\"Everyone knows that vaccines contain dangerous chemicals!\"); or an attempt to impress by a daughter's new boyfriend (\"But I've heard that the mammalian eye is way too complicated to have evolved by chance!\"). What's a poor scientist to do? Sit in miserable silence? Start an argument? Perhaps pour yourself a glass of wine or six? Truth be told, I have tried all of those strategies. And I'm here to tell you that they don't work very well. But it is possible to engage people who reject or doubt the established scientific consensus without starting World War III or surrendering your self-respect. It's even possible to change people's minds -- at least some people's minds, some of the time. But more important than changing minds is acting as a respectful diplomat from the Country of Science. We've been talking for awhile about starting a series in which NCSE staff helps you navigate the tricky world of talking about science in a social setting. This is important even when your audience doesn't include a \"skeptic\" -- all scientists need to learn how to communicate effectively with non-scientists, whether science friend or potential science foe. As Stephanie Keep pointed out in a recent post , polls show that people respect scientists, but they don't necessarily trust them. Talking about science in an engaging manner free from jargon is key to narrowing the gap between scientists and those who admire scientists, but aren't sure they accept specific conclusions that rub them the wrong way. Advertisement I was inspired to write this inaugural post when just the other week I found myself seated next to a climate \"skeptic\" at a dinner party. A self-described \"curmudgeon,\" the gentleman in question -- holder of a PhD in a discipline of science that shall remain nameless (but feel free to speculate...) -- told me that he just wasn't sure that recent changes in climate were not part of a natural cycle. What would you say? And with that short teaser, I'll leave it to you to come up with some ideas. In a few days, I'll tell you how the conversation actually went down.

The Little Question That Fueled Alan Alda's Big Push For Plain-Spoken Science (PODCAST) The Little Question That Fueled Actor's Big Push For Plain-Spoken Science By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jan 9, 2015, 10:52 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Alan Alda became famous for his film and television roles, including Hawkeye Pierce in the long-running TV series M*A*S*H*. In recent years, however, the 78-year-old actor-writer-director has taken on a new role--as a high-profile champion of science literacy. Alda professes a lifelong love of science and clearly holds scientists in high esteem--Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman is a particular favorite. But when it comes to explaining scientific concepts, Alda believes scientists and science teachers often fall short. Advertisement It's a problem he first encountered all the way back in grade school. \"When I was 11 years old, I asked a teacher what's going on in a flame,\" he said in a recent interview with David Freeman, senior science editor at The Huffington Post. \"It's fascinating. You can put your finger through it but it's hot, it gives off light. What's happening in the flame? And the teacher said, 'It's oxidation.' That was it. I didn't know what that meant. It was just another word.\" That frustrating experience, Alda said in the interview, was the inspiration for The Flame Challenge , an annual competition in which scientists and scientists-in-training take a shot at explaining a scientific concept or phenomenon with the winners judged by--you guessed it--11-year-olds. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's Where NASA Might Go For Its Next Space Mission Venus is on its radar. By Mehreen Kasana Front Page Editor, The Huffington Post Oct 8, 2015, 05:44 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Is Venus ready for its close-up? NASA has announced five projects under consideration for its next space mission, and the second planet from the sun plays a role in two of them. One of the proposals involves dropping a spacecraft, dubbed DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging), through Venus' atmosphere to study its composition. Another proposal would send a craft to map the surface of the planet in detail, to see how similar Venus\u2019 surface is to Earth's and whether Venus was ever capable of habitation. Advertisement The other three projects would focus on the study of asteroids and near-earth objects -- a term for anything floating in orbit around our planet, including meteoroids and old satellites. NASA is considering space missions that would help it learn more about Venus. NASA/Getty Images The investigations were selected from a pool of 27 submitted proposals for their ability to reveal new insights about the universe around us. Advertisement \u201cDynamic and exciting missions like these hold promise to unravel the mysteries of our solar system and inspire future generations of explorers,\u201d John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, said in a statement. NASA's Discovery Program originally solicited proposals for its 13th mission in February 2014. NASA will give the team behind each project $3 million for research. The agency will then evaluate what the teams come up with and decide by September 2016 which mission to carry out. Whichever mission it selects is expected to cost about $500 million, not including the expense of post-launch operations.

Trump Crossed Deeply Ingrained Moral Boundary With Khan Comments Offending people and not apologizing for it may have helped Trump so far. But there\u2019s a limit to breaking the rules. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Aug 3, 2016, 03:41 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT In attacking the parents of a fallen soldier, Trump has truly gone too far. Carlo Allegri / Reuters John McCain. Elizabeth Warren . Megyn Kelly. Carly Fiorina. A New York Times reporter with a muscular disorder. The 12 million Mexicans living in the United States. The 1.6 billion Muslims around the world. These are just a few examples of the many people Donald Trump has offended over the past year \u2015 and still managed to walk away politically unscathed. But in his latest public relations disaster, maligning the parents of fallen soldier, political strategists say Trump may have gone too far. That\u2019s because his words offended many people\u2019s sense of decency \u2015 something deeply ingrained in the psychology of humans, no matter which political party they ascribe to. Advertisement Trump responded to a speech by a Muslim man whose son was killed while serving in Iraq by making disparaging comments about the soldier\u2019s mother, Ghazala Khan, suggesting she was silent because she \u201cwasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say.\u201d In an op-ed in the Washington Post, Ghazala Khan wrote that she was too overwhelmed with emotions to speak under the towering picture of her fallen son. So why is this situation different from Trump\u2019s prior offenses? Because we\u2019re hard-wired to care when someone crosses a moral line. Research suggests our brains are equipped with some sense of right or wrong early on. Infants as young as 3 months of age are able to evaluate others based on their prosocial and antisocial behaviors , and are attracted to prosocial individuals, according to a 2011 study. Another study dealing with 8-month-olds found that they like to see do-gooders rewarded, but prefer punishing antisocial characters who act against the unspoken rules of \u201cbeing nice to people.\u201d What should Trump do now? Apologizing is a universal social behavior that has developed to remedy these situations, and often, a wrongdoer\u2019s chances of being re-admitted to the community hinge on showing sincere remorse and offering restitution. Thanks to our seemingly intrinsic morality, knowing which situations require an apology usually comes fairly easy to humans. Advertisement In the 1960s, sociologist Erving Goffman examined apologizing behavior. He concluded that a successful apology needs several elements: Apologizers experience embarrassment, acknowledge violating the rules, ask for forgiveness and express willingness to take a punishment. But Donald Trump can\u2019t be sorry, because he\u2019s never wrong. That\u2019s what he told Jimmy Fallon September last year. Sure, apologizing is a great thing, he said, but you have to be wrong. And he can\u2019t even remember the last time he was. In general, research has suggested that all things being equal, people show different degrees of ability to understand their wrongdoing and the need to apologize. Men, for example, apologize less than women and report that they have committed fewer offenses, a 2010 study showed. This suggested that \u201cmen apologize less frequently than women because they have a higher threshold for what constitutes offensive behavior,\u201d the researchers wrote. Advertisement What does research say about a person who never apologizes? Although understanding of moral trespassing appears to be a basic cognitive skill, for some people, an inability to apologize is evidence of a deeper issue. Psychiatrists have generally refrained from diagnosing Trump from afar, under ethical rules devised by the American Psychiatric Association following a similar case in 1964 that ended poorly . Nevertheless, perhaps considering Trump is running for the highest office in the country, some therapists have weighed in , finding his public behavior to be classically narcissistic and devoid of empathy. If he really doesn\u2019t feel sorry, there\u2019s another option that could work for Trump in the case of the Khan family: offer a fake apology. Such a utilitarian approach has been observed in many a politician before, said Edwin Battistella, a linguist who wrote a book exploring the success and failure of public apologies , from Bill Clinton to Jane Fonda. But Trump can\u2019t seem to do it. \u201cI thought of adding Trump to the paperback version, but realized there wasn\u2019t much to say,\u201d Battistella said, considering the dearth of public apologies from the GOP candidate. Advertisement Trump may hope that standing his ground is a sign of strength. American culture has embraced this idea, especially for men. And people sometimes find rule-breakers attractive \u2015 something Trump has capitalized on throughout his campaign by presenting himself as an outsider who\u2019s not afraid to say what people are really thinking. But in this case, it\u2019s unlikely most people will see attacking a military family as a sign of strength or power. At the end of the day, the best way to remedy the situation is an apology. \u201cA personal apology says that I\u2019m a different person, I\u2019m not going to behave this way in the future,\u201d Battistella said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Cuba Has An Ambitious Plan To Protect Its Environment From Tourists As doors open to the island nation, conservation efforts are underway. By Casey Williams On assignment for HuffPost Mar 19, 2016, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Sea turtle off the coast of Cuba. Noel Lopez Fernandez President Barack Obama 's upcoming trip to Cuba on Sunday promises to revive a question raised when the U.S. began normalizing relations with the island nation : As American tourists pour in, what will happen to Cuba's natural environment? An influx of tourists and businesses will likely bring investment to Cuba, but some experts fear the expansion of tourism, mechanized agriculture and oil exploration could threaten its well-preserved natural ecosystems. Advertisement In fact, the Cubans \" have a lot to lose in terms of biodiversity, marine and coastal habitat and fish populations if they don\u2019t do things right moving ahead,\" Daniel Whittle, senior director of the Cuba program at the Environmental Defense Fund, told The Huffington Post. The uptick in American tourism is already \"putting a real strain\" on Cuba, he said. Despite fears of environmental ruin, both Cuba and the U.S. have been working to ensure the restoration of diplomatic ties doesn't come at the expense of Cuba's land and marine ecosystems. \"At the o fficial level, environmental protection is still a high priority,\" Whittle said about Cuba. \"It's something [President Ra\u00fal] Castro and his deputies talk a lot about.\" Advertisement U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has made protecting the environment a central issue in the State Department's negotiations with Cuba. Of the four agreements signed by U.S. and Cuban officials since the re-opening of relations in 2014, two have laid out plans for environmental protection in Cuba, according to Whittle. One agreement, signed in November 2015, outlines a planned effort by both countries to share scientific knowledge, collaborate on conservation efforts and jointly \"address the causes and effects of climate change\" in Cuba, according to a copy of the agreement . Advertisement \"The agreement provides an unprecedented vehicle for the governments to actually talk to each other and influence each other,\" Whittle said. Through it, \"t he U.S. government can influence how science is conducted in Cuban national parks, how well they\u2019re managed and even policy relating to these protected areas.\" Coral reef off the coast of Cuba. Noel Lopez Fernandez A lot to lose For Cuba, which has been called the \"jewel of the Caribbean,\" the stakes of environmental protection are high. Advertisement \"It's not a secret that Cuba has some of the best preserved land and waters in the Caribbean,\" Luis Sol\u00f3rzano, executive director of the Cuba program at the non-profit Nature Conservancy told HuffPost on Friday. The country has 4,000 uninhabited islands and keys, miles of undeveloped coastline, a huge variety of native species and an extensive coral reef system, according to Whittle. It's no accident they remain well-preserved. The trade embargo that kept American cars off Cuban roads for half a century has also prevented farmers from adopting high-tech agriculture practices used in the U.S., according to Whittle. And it has kept American tourists off beaches and limited the development of Cuba's oil resources in the Caribbean. Advertisement \"B ecause of US-Cuba relations, Cuba hasn\u2019t had access to U.S. technology, hasn't had access to grants and loans from institutions like the World Bank,\" Whittle said. \"So they have a lot to lose in terms of biodiversity.\" Cuba's coral reefs are the \"heart of the marine ecosystem.\" Noel Lopez Fernandez Cuba has vigilantly sought to protect its natural environment over the years. \"T he Cubans have been pioneers and really aggressive in declaring protected areas,\" Sol\u00f3rzano said. Cuba's commitment to conservation began in 1992, when then-President Fidel Castro announced that his government would confront the \"ecological destruction threatening our planet\" at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Advertisement Since then, shrewd environmental management policies have required the Cuban government to protect 25 percent of its marine habitat from development, according to Whittle. (By contrast, the U.S. has only protected between 3 and 5 percent of its marine habitats, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.) The Cuban government also requires proposals for new developments to undergo a rigorous environmental review process. Cuba's environmental record isn't perfect, however. While its policies look good on paper, \"implementation has been a mixed bag,\" Whittle said. The country's aging infrastructure has hurt wastewater treatment, agricultural land suffers from soil erosion, and dams have altered water flows in fragile coastal estuaries, according to Whittle. Advertisement Cuba also isn't walled off from the world. Cuba does business with many developed countries, including Canada, and its beaches and forests have attracted foreign tourists for decades . Opening up to Americans will heap new pressures onto Cuba's existing environmental challenges, experts say. \"The question we're asking is 'What if you unleash all these pressures that have not been there?'\" Sol\u00f3rzano said. Advertisement An underwater look at Cuba's coast. Noel Lopez Fernandez Striking a delicate balance If Cuba wants to expand industry on the island without despoiling the environment, the government will have to strike a delicate balance between growth and conservation, according to Sol\u00f3rzano. \"It is about the balance,\" he said. \"How do they balance their economic needs and preserving the natural capital on which they depend?\" Advertisement Right now, Cuba imports 70 percent of its food at a cost of about $2 billion every year, according to Pedro Sanchez, director of the Agriculture and Food Security Center at Columbia University's Earth Institute. Producing enough food domestically to feed the country's more than 11 million people will require turning some of Cuba's unused land into highly productive crop fields, Sanchez told HuffPost on Friday. The trick, Sanchez said, will be ramping up food production without causing undue damage to the environment. \"With proper investment and research ... Cuba can increase its food production to the point that it can be nearly self-sufficient without causing significant damage to the coastal ecosystems that we all want to preserve,\" Sanchez said. Advertisement Researchers at the University of Florida and the non-profit Nature Conservancy are working with Cuba's Ministry of Environment to ensure Cuba expands food protection without despoiling the country's land and waters, according to Sanchez. \u201cAs a kid, I fished in the coastal waters off Cuba, and I don\u2019t want them messed up.\"\u201d - Dr. Pedro Sanchez, director of the Agriculture and Food Security Center at Columbia University's Earth Institute It's a project that would not have happened had the U.S. not resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba, said Sanchez, who works on the project. Advertisement \"I doubt very much whether any such thing would have happened before the Obama opening,\" Sanchez said. If changing relations with the U.S. have created an opportunity for Cuba to develop economically without sacrificing its rich natural habitats, Sol\u00f3rzano thinks the Cubans can make the most of the opportunity. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Ashley Madison Hack Could Have A Devastating Psychological Fallout Users of the affair website could face long-lasting emotional trauma. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 20, 2015, 01:49 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Carl Court/Getty Images Ashley Madison users may face more than just marital discord after the dating website's recent hack. On Tuesday night, hackers came through on their threat to leak almost 10 gigabytes of user data , revealing information including the names, email addresses and credit card numbers for up to 34 million people allegedly registered on the site, which caters to people looking to cheat on their spouses. Advertisement While individuals can search for their spouses' information, 4chan users -- who recently leaked images from a celebrity photo hack -- are also combing through the data and looking to out high-profile users. The potentially devastating fallout of the leak is just beginning, with users of the site and their families being most likely to suffer. What do these unmasked users face? In addition to the obvious and devastating repercussions for those who were caught cheating -- marital conflict, divorce and the rupturing of family ties -- users of the site (whether they've actually cheated or not) may be subject to psychological trauma, public humiliation and possible blackmail. Public figures and government officials, of course, have the farthest to fall. Advertisement \"Dealing with an affair in a very public way makes the embarrassment greater and the hurt for the spouse and kids even more devastating,\" Dr. Elaine Ducharme, a Connecticut-based clinical psychologist specializing in family trauma and divorce, told The Huffington Post in an email. So what are some of the psychological impacts of being unmasked as a cheater on the Internet -- or having your partner outed as one? Here's what some experts say we can expect the fallout to look like. The Curse Of Uncertainty One of the first likely outcomes is that former users of the site will develop a sense of constant fear. Advertisement \"There's a threat out there, and you don't know when it might hit,\" said Dr. Katherine Hertlein, a psychologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas who specializes in technology and relationships. \"In a case where security is breached or you experience a threat that's ambiguous -- so you don't really know if or when it's going to hit you -- you spend a lot of your time being hyper-vigilant.\" Users might develop a habit of opening their inboxes and waiting for the worst-case-scenario email from their partner, or becoming tense every time they answer a phone call from their spouse, wondering if they're about to be exposed. It's also likely users will experience a sense of losing control, which may lead to attempts to regain control or protect themselves in any way possible. Advertisement \"People who use the site really don't have control of the information that's out there at this point,\" Hertlein said. \"When people have that type of traumatic experience, they inherently find ways to take control again.\" One of the most damaging ways people try to gain control is through self-harm and, if taken to the extreme, suicide. \"This is one of the things that may be a concern when someone who is well-known becomes exposed through this Ashley Madison breach,\" Hertlein said. \"Not only do they have the trauma of humiliation and exposure, and the challenge to the sense of self and impaired sense of identity -- they will want to take control back in ways to feel safe again.\" Advertisement Ruptured Relationships Whether a cheater is exposed online or face-to-face, the consequences for a relationship are largely the same. \"There will be divorces, there will be pain, there will be some who realize they have a sexual 'issue' or addiction,\" said Robert Weiss, a social worker based in Long Beach, California, and the author of Closer Together, Further Apart: The Effect of Technology and the Internet on Parenting, Work and Relationships . There are some important differences, however, between being caught on the web versus in bed. Being exposed in an online affair tends to be more of a \"mind mess\" than being caught in the act, Hertlein says, because there's more of a gray area. Advertisement \"There is a level of denial that can occur ( Well, yes we were talking but nothing physical happened ) that can't occur catching someone in bed, where it's more obvious,\" Hertlein said. \"The ambiguity creates a stalemate between couples ( You cheated/No, I didn't ), which can prevent healing.\" Public Humiliation And Blackmail It's no exaggeration to say this hack has the potential to ruin lives. High-profile Ashley Madison users -- perhaps some of those possessing the 15,000 .mil or .gov email addresses released -- could face blackmail. \"Some people might be vulnerable to blackmail, if they don't want details of their membership or sexual proclivities to become public,\" security news analyst Graham Cluley wrote on his blog . Advertisement Public humiliation is another concern for well-known figures. Social media has created an aggressive culture of public shaming in which individuals take it upon themselves to inflict psychological damage on others, and sometimes this damage can persist for years. More often than not -- as we saw recently in the case of the American dentist who killed Cecil the lion -- the punishment goes beyond the scope of the crime. \"We might see these people's livelihoods being threatened because there might be some damaging effects that involve their career,\" Hertlein said. \"There would be in some ways a threat to survival or a threat to their identity of who they are as people.\" Previous victims of online shaming have suffered from depression and insomnia , post-traumatic stress disorder and even suicide . Advertisement As Cluley warned , \"There could be genuine casualties.\" ____ Need help? In the U.S., call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline .

Dolphins Chatter More When Solving Tricky Tasks The charismatic creatures vocalize more during cooperative problem solving, a new study suggests. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 30, 2016, 09:46 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT It's known dolphins use acoustic signals to maintain contact with one another and find food. Now, a new study shows that they also use them when solving complicated problems together. While scientists can't say for certain that dolphins have what humans call a language, the findings suggest vocalizations may play a much larger role in efforts that require cooperation than previously thought, lead author Holli Eskelinen , an assistant director of research at Dolphins Plus in Florida, told The Huffington Post. \"This is the first time that we can say conclusively that vocalizations were used to solve a cooperative task/problem,\" she wrote in an email. Advertisement Jeff Foott via Getty Images In an initial study last year, Eskelinen and other researchers set out to answer the question of whether bottlenose dolphins could cooperate to solve a task, as chimpanzees and elephants have been documented to do. To do so, they presented six captive dolphins at the Dolphins Plus facility in Key Largo with a plastic pipe container full of fish, squid and other treats. The container, with a rope at each end, was designed so that opening it is easiest if two animals work together by pulling from either end. Four of the six dolphins were unsuccessful in getting to the food. Two dominant males, however, proved victorious time and time again. Advertisement It was during further analysis of the original data, Eskelinen said, that the team noticed the increase in dolphin chatter, specifically burst pulse signals , which are most commonly affiliated with social interactions. \"All we can say at this point is that we observed a significant increase in vocalizations during the two animals interacting condition,\" she said. \"We can\u2019t say with certainty what the vocalizations mean, but we were able to discern that the increase in vocalizations was identified when they were interacting with the apparatus simultaneously.\" Advertisement Leigh Torres , a marine ecologist at Oregon State University, told New Scientist that the study findings \" point toward the possibility of a dolphin language that enables team problem solving.\" Andrew Dewald, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Hawaii, however, urged caution when comparing the cognitive abilities of humans to that of a non-human species. While the animals demonstrated a behavior that points to a capacity for cooperation and problem solving, he said, \"caution is required here in taking the behavior of sound production being ultimately an indication of comprehension.\" Still, Dewald said it is a \"neat paper\" and a \"really clever paradigm\" to get to the question of whether two or more dolphins can communicate in order to solve a problem that benefits all parties. Advertisement Eskelinen told HuffPost many people are anxious to show parallels between animals and humans, but using the word \"language\" when describing the communication observed in dolphins is \"very premature.\" \"Often times people ask me 'How smart are dolphins?' when we should be asking ourselves, 'How are dolphins smart?'\" she said. \"The same holds true for their communicative abilities, instead of trying to see if they communicate like humans, our focus has shifted to a more baseline approach of how they communicate.\" Eskelinen added that scientists are \"just scratching the surface in understanding the components of each different sound type and what they are used for.\" Advertisement Brian Skerry/National Geographic Dolphins Plus consists of two separate facilities on the island of Key Largo, Florida. In addition to offering several programs to swim with captive dolphins, experiences that start at $150 per person, Eskelinen said the facilities host some 20,000 students a year and are currently involved in more than 50 research projects related to acoustics, behavior and cognition. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Swim-with-dolphins establishments, including Dolphins Plus and SeaWorld, have long been scrutinized by conservationists and animal welfare groups who say dolphins are dangerous and that it is unethical to keep the animals in a captive environment. Advertisement Eskelinen said that while she understands many believe captivity is a double-edged sword, the research being conducted is helping conserve the species and contributing to a greater understanding of these animals and their wild counterparts. In the end, she said, it may help humans better manage our own activities and help protect the species. \"As long as we're being a part of the solution and not the problem, then this kind of research is important,\" she said.

For Staving Off Depression, Talking Face To Face Trumps Email And Phone A new study shows social interactions can help ward off depression -- but only when they're in person. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Oct 6, 2015, 11:06 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT George Marks via Getty Images We all get by with a little help from our friends, but that help is much more valuable when it's given in person rather than via email or telephone. A new study from Oregon Health & Science University shows that face-to-face interactions are more powerful than digital ones at warding off depression in older adults. The study, which was published online Monday in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, showed that older adults who met regularly with family and friends were 5 percent less likely to report symptoms of depression, compared to those who spoke with their loved ones via email or phone. The benefits lasted for at least two years. Advertisement \"We don't know precisely what the magic ingredient is, but our results imply there is something special and uniquely effective about meeting up in-person in terms of preventing future depression,\" Dr. Alan Teo, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the university, told The Huffington Post in an email. For the study, the researchers analyzed data from over 11,000 adults over the age of 50 who participated in a longitudinal study with the University of Michigan, measuring each individual's frequency of in-person, telephone and written (including email) social interactions. Two years after collecting that data, the researchers assessed the study participants' risk for depression, taking into consideration factors including pre-existing depression, physical health and proximity to family. What did the researchers find? Individuals who had little face-to-face contact with friends and family had a nearly doubled risk of depression two years later. Frequent phone calls, emails and other types of communication had no effect on a person's risk for depression. Advertisement Among older adults who spent time with their families at least three times a week, only 6.5 percent were at risk for depression. Those who saw their loved ones every few months or less frequently had an 11.5 percent chance of experiencing depressive symptoms. While the study looked only at depression in older adults, Teo said it was likely that the results also apply to younger people. But, he said, \"We need more research to determine if it applies across the full age spectrum.\" The findings don't suggest that email and social media aren't valuable means of social interaction. However, the benefits of these interactions don't seem to extend to guarding against depression. Advertisement \"My message is not that social media or calls on smart phones are things we should cut out of our lives,\" Teo said. \"I use social media too. But when it comes to depression prevention, it seems hard to beat a good old-fashioned face-to-face visit.\" For older adults, the benefits of strong social connections may also extend to improved cognition , better health behaviors and increased longevity . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

For both older and younger people, there's likely to be little downside to making time for quality, face-to-face interactions with friends and family.

Here's A Humanoid Robot Taking A Walk In The Woods Don't worry: It didn't escape the lab. By Andres Jauregui Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 18, 2015, 10:24 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Ladies and gentlemen, Atlas has left the building. The Boston Dynamics humanoid robot, which was prominently featured in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, took a stroll in the Massachusetts woods in footage posted online Saturday. The video was originally shared during a robotics panel earlier this month at MIT's Fab Lab conference. It was a change of scenery for the two-legged robot , which previously negotiated obstacles in a lab setting. Its makers say taking on the great outdoors is an important step in the robot's development. Advertisement \"We're interested in getting this robot out in the world,\" Boston Dynamics founder Marc Raibert said during his presentation. \"All kinds of stuff happens out there. You can't predict what it's going to be like.\" Researchers at the company, which was purchased by Google in 2013, are interested in testing balance and dynamics in robots. They're perhaps best known for their four-legged bots , Big Dog and Spot. Advertisement Atlas isn't yet as graceful as his quadrupedal cousins -- its gait is shuffling, and it still requires a power cable to get around outside -- but Raibert said that could change soon enough. \"I'm not saying it can do everything you can do,\" Raibert said. \"But you can imagine if we keep pushing we'll get there.\" A team using Running Man, an Atlas robot by Boston Dynamics, recently walked away with the $1 million second-place prize in the DRC finals in June. Advertisement DARPA organized the robotics challenge in response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster , during which radiation levels made it impossible for workers to shut down critical systems. The goal is to enable robots controlled remotely by humans to use tools and operate machines in similarly hazardous scenarios. While the robots still move slowly and have a tendency to fall down , significant progress has been made. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

SpaceX Lands Reusable Falcon 9 Rocket (UPDATE) Despite initial worries, the company has done it again. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost May 6, 2016, 01:10 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING SpaceX successfully landed its Falcon 9 rocket on an unmanned drone ship in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean early Friday morning. The landing, which founder Elon Musk called unlikely due to the complexity of a \"faster and hotter\" reentry, was another big win for the company set on reaching Mars by 2018 . The launch took place without a hitch at 1:21 a.m. ET, sending a communications satellite into orbit during a mission dubbed JCSAT-14. Around 10 minutes after liftoff, the first stage of the Falcon 9 landed unscathed aboard the drone ship \"Of Course I Still Love You,\" floating a few hundred miles off the coast of Florida. Advertisement Woohoo!! https://t.co/0P8n8VmFbr \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 6, 2016 This is the second successful landing of Musk's reusuable rocket on a ship. SpaceX first made the historic attempt last month after a half dozen unsuccessful endeavors ended in fiery crashes. Despite last month's success, the company was hesitant about the prospects of Friday's launch due to the rocket reentering the atmosphere much faster . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The launch will undoubtably be a boon to Musk's efforts to land an unmanned mission on Mars within the next few years. Those plans rest on the back of a much larger Dragon spacecraft fueled by a Falcon Heavy rocket system . But if the successful landings are any indication, such a feat shouldn't be too far away.

Ex-NASA Astronaut Tom Jones 'Used To Be A Big UFO Fan.' Not Now. \"I haven\u2019t seen the proof that would satisfy me that there\u2019s really something there.\" By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost May 7, 2016, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Astronaut Tom Jones during one of his three spacewalks on Space Shuttle mission STS-98 in February 2001 which activated the U.S. Destiny Laboratory, the historic scientific centerpiece of the International Space Station. NASA Photo By Marsha Ivins Stories have been told for decades about American astronauts who supposedly have seen unexplained aerial phenomena (as Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton prefers to call UFOs ). But how many astronauts have really reported close encounters with objects that could be verified as actual unknowns? Vanishingly few, it turns out. Advertisement Veteran NASA astronaut Tom Jones said he wondered about UFOs long before he joined the space agency. \"I used to be a big UFO fan when I was a teenager, thinking that this was the next great frontier of exploration,\" Jones said in a recent interview with The Huffington Post. \"I dropped that opinion later on, after not seeing the evidence that I was looking for.\" In his Smithsonian Air & Space Magazine column, \" Ask the Astronaut ,\" Jones answered a recent question about whether he or other astronauts had ever seen UFOs from orbit. He wrote: Astronauts have not seen any evidence of alien life. Reports of unidentified flying objects in images returned from the shuttle or [space] station have turned out to be ice crystals, drifting orbital debris, lightning flashes, or meteors streaking through the dark atmosphere below. So far, our search for extraterrestrial life -- and other civilizations in space -- has turned up no proof of alien civilizations. Jones told HuffPost how, during his 1996 space shuttle mission, there were reports that his crew saw UFOs: I was on the shuttle Columbia -- STS-80 -- and even made a blog entry, 'Did UFOs Visit The Shuttle Columbia?' Because when we came back from that mission in 1996, NASA got several queries from people who were watching the video -- NASA TV back then -- and said, 'Hey, we saw spaceships on the shuttle video. What's NASA got to say about that?' Public affairs referred them to me because I was one of the crew members, and I looked at the video and I said, 'Oh, I know what this is -- this is just ice crystals floating along beside the ship for the first couple of days of the flight.' What looked to some people like a spaceship streaking across the star field, was -- to us, looking out the windows -- a complete non-event. And yet, it was very significant to people who were watching. Jones flew on four space shuttle missions over 11 years, culminating with STS-98, in February 2001, as seen in the below video. On that mission, he led three spacewalks to install the U.S. Destiny Laboratory -- the historic scientific centerpiece for the International Space Station. Advertisement Jones said no contemporary astronaut has ever told him of seeing something unexplained or inexplicable. \"Certainly, nothing in the way of spaceships,\" he added. \"Now, I'm aware that there have been a couple of astronauts in the past who've spoken out and said they know from other people that there's evidence of UFOs and spaceships that have visited the Earth and that the government might be withholding it. Advertisement \"They all seem to be secondhand, or they seem to be sightings of things that they've seen in orbit that, perhaps, they couldn't explain at the time. And that's where the story seems to peter out.\" One of those mentioned by Jones was the late Gordon Cooper, an original Mercury astronaut -- one of the famous \"Right Stuff\" space voyagers. In 1975, Cooper told this writer how, in 1951 (before he became an astronaut), he and several other officers at an Air Force base in Germany witnessed groups of circular objects passing over the base. \"A weatherman spotted some strange objects flying at fairly high altitude and before long, the entire fighter group was out peering through binoculars at these groups of objects coming over in very strange patterns. But unlike fighters, they would almost stop in their forward velocity and change 90 degrees in their flight path. We never could get close enough to pin them down, but they were round in shape and very metallic-looking. Advertisement \"I'd like to point out that most astronauts are very reluctant to even discuss UFOs due to the great numbers of people who have indiscriminately sold fake stories and forged documents abusing their names and reputations without hesitation,\" Cooper said. Jones said it's important to be cautious about unusual aerial objects. \"Even from people that I respect, like a couple of very early and famous astronauts, I haven't seen the proof that would satisfy me that there's really something there,\" he said. \"And I think it's far more likely that people who see unexplained things in the sky, there's no proof that they're actually intelligently guided or alien spaceships of any kind. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

A Chat with Information Scientist Pedro Mariju\u00e1n A Chat with Information Scientist Pedro Mariju\u00e1n By Suzan Mazur, Contributor journalist journalist Aug 6, 2016, 09:06 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

PEDRO CLEMENTE MARIJU\u00c1N While there is still no scientific consensus on what \"life\" is -- although that does not deter attempts to make life in the lab -- there is a growing conversation among scientists about life's \"information\" component. However, scientists also find it difficult articulating just what information is. So I phoned information scientist Pedro Clemente Mariju\u00e1n in Spain to explore the subject. Mariju\u00e1n's current research interests include \"the nature of intelligence and the nature of information, at the molecular-cellular and organismic (brain) levels.\" Pedro Mariju\u00e1n is Senior Research Scientist at Spain's Aragon Institute of Health Sciences ( IACS ) where he heads the Bioinformation Group. He has also served as IACS Research Director (2011-2015). In 1991, Mariju\u00e1n co-founded FIS (Foundations of Information Science) with theoretical biologist Michael Conrad . Mariju\u00e1n says one of the missions of FIS is \"organizing a sound body of new thinking about the informational cohesion of the physical, biological and social realms\" of science. He is also Vice-President for Protocol of the International Society for Information Studies ( IS4SI ). Advertisement Pedro Mariju\u00e1n's professional career began as an industrial engineer in the 1970s in Spain, working with computers in \"enterprise organization,\" after receiving his undergraduate degree in engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Later inspired by John von Neumann 's ideas, Mariju\u00e1n began his own investigations into cognitive neuroscience, which led to his PhD (University of Barcelona, 1989): \"On Natural Intelligence: The Evolution of Biological Information Processing.\" In the early 1990s he was a Visiting Research Associate at the University of Chicago, working with microbiologist James Shapiro , as well as at the University of Canberra. Mariju\u00e1n has taught engineering at the University of Zaragoza and is former SAMCA Chair at the Engineering School, University of Zaragoza. Through the years Pedro Mariju\u00e1n has organized and co-organized international conferences on information science in Madrid, Vienna, Paris, Beijing, Gothenberg (upcoming, 2017) and elsewhere, and a regular series of seminars in Spain on biomedicine and neuroscience. Advertisement He is author of the book, The Dual Brain and numerous other scientific publications, editor of \" Cajal and Consciousness \" (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences) and of special issues on FIS published in the journals BioSystems and Symmetry: Culture and Science as well as of \"Selected Papers from 'FIS 2010 Beijing.'\" One of Pedro Mariju\u00e1n's other principal interests is understanding the sound of laughter, its structure, and using that information as a diagnostic tool in biomedicine . Our interview follows. Suzan Mazu r: In between your careers as an industrial engineer and cognitive neuroscientist, you were a visiting research associate at the University of Chicago in the early 1990s, working with microbiologist James Shapiro . That's quite a range of expertise. What sort of research were you doing with Jim Shapiro in Chicago? Advertisement Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : I was advancing an informational scheme of the prokaryotic cell in relation to James Shapiro's interest in developing new evolutionary ideas. At the same time I was learning real biology from James -- I personally thank him for his hospitality and patience. However, I realized I needed stronger insights into the molecular machinery of the cell and into enzymes and proteins, so I began collaborating with biophysicist and theoretical biologist Michael Conrad as well as with enzymologist John Westley . Both were relatively close to James Shapiro's interests. Michael Conrad was especially influential; Michael pioneered molecular computing and adaptability in ecological information processes. He looked beyond science in his work to philosophy, art, and literature. Suzan Mazur : Please tell me a little about your current research interests. Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : Here at the Aragon Institute of Health Sciences (IACS) in Zaragoza, I'm investigating cellular signaling systems, social bonding, and human laughter. I and my small bioinformation group -- Jorge Navarro and Raquel del Moral -- are interested in studying everything alive that communicates: cells, organisms, people, and the way human society is structured through social bonds, i.e., language -- talking face-to-face, by phone, texting, etc. Because it's through language that human society evolved, grew complex and interesting. People do need to talk to one another. If we don't speak, we don't feel well. Isolation is the worst scenario for human beings. Language, which was at first instrumental in humans, eventually became a necessity. How much do people need to talk? And to whom? I'm interested in how people and communities build and maintain societal bonds through conversation and what the consequences are when that natural communication process goes awry. To thrive, humans need to immerse themselves in social layers: An intimate layer (\"family\"), close friends, work relationships as well as general acquaintances. These bonds form a person's \"sociotype.\" We have not only a genotype and phenotype, but also a \"sociotype.\" Suzan Mazur : Is this layering a perspective from your background in engineering? Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : Perhaps. I was an industrial engineer here in Spain during the 1970s, working with computers, in the field of \"enterprise organization.\" I got terribly excited about the possibility of similar information processes in the human brain and in society. Then I read John von Neumann's book comparing the human brain to a computer. I began to realize the informational scheme of the single cell was missing in the scientific literature. I began doing informal research and wrote some newspaper articles, which eventually led to my PhD [\"On Natural Intelligence: The Evolution of Biological Information Processing\"]. Suzan Mazur : IACS, where you're currently Senior Research Scientist -- this is an organization focused on biomedical research? Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : IACS and its germane organization IIS Aragon cover all areas of biomedical research for the main hospitals in the Aragon region. Until the political change last year, I was Director of Research in charge of organizing teams, and focused on the many problems biomedical research has. I was reassigned as IACS Senior Research Scientist. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : Information science research. Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : Actually our group looks to find ways to apply information science to biomedicine. For example, we use information science as a diagnostic tool to study changes in the sound of laughter of depressed individuals. We've used it with EEG records, and to look for objective markers in fibromyalgia. We've also designed a questionnaire to gauge the sensitivity of the individual state of the sociotype. It's particularly helpful for the elderly because they suffer a lot from loneliness. Suzan Mazur : You first wrote on the informational patterns of laughter 10 or so years ago. What was the thrust of that paper? Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : I highlighted the social role of laughter and peculiarities of the structure of the sounds of laughter. We've written four or five scientific papers on laughter since then. Laughter is a very, very strategic way of communicating. It connects the physiological, psychological, cognitive, emotional and social. Laughter tells a lot about a person and their environment. It's highly personal. Why is someone laughing? Laughter may be particularly beautiful -- or out of context. Why is that? What are the main sound components we instinctively scan when we laugh? What is the emotional code attached to laughter? Suzan Mazur : It's interesting that comedy in America used to be spontaneous, quite funny, a healthy release of tension. We had comedy from the Borscht Belt, Sid Caesar, Steve Allen, early Woody Allen, 1970s Saturday Night Live . Michael O'Donoghue -- the comedic genius behind SNL -- was a friend of mine. By the late 70s, Michael thought SNL was no longer funny. Roughly around the time he left the show. That's not a joke, by the way. Comedy now in America, at least, seems uninspired, a captive of its commercial sponsors. Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : Yes. I agree with you. I don't follow media much, but it's clear that individuals are now overloaded with new kinds of artificial information flows. When a person is systematically suffering information overloads, humor is a kind of canary in the mine, a barometer. Entering the mine, the canary dies or not. Humor, or lack of it, is an indicator of individual mental health and happiness, of a person's relationship to their social contacts and of societal health. We are seeing a rise in the number of depressed patients. We see an amazing increase in the number of people living alone. We are witnessing the accelerated loss of what Robert Putnam calls \"social capital.\" The information revolution is contributing to these problems -- introducing surrogate bonds via new technologies that capture a growing portion of a person's time. People are alone, going from screen to screen, abandoning long-term rewards of face-to-face conversation, endangering their social bonds. Our very social nature is being denied, or mystified, and our sociotype is becoming dramatically flattened. Suzan Mazur : I've interviewed Jaron Lanier , the \"father of virtual reality\" who has said regarding the digital world that humans may have taken a wrong turn for the right reasons and he predicts artificial intelligence ideology will reach a breaking point in Europe, but \"the US will break first certainly, as we'll find out.\" His thinking is that human job displacement due to computerization and robotics will lead to a welfare state that can't be sustained. Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : Something similar happened with the first industrial revolution, with the second industrial revolution, and now we are suffering the consequences of the information and computer revolution. We have not developed the tools to successfully integrate all these artificial information flows with our natural information flows. The adaptability of our social nature, of our sociotype, has been pushed to the extremes. In my info science parlance, the artificial flows of information that are reshaping the structures of our societies at tremendous speed are blind to the natural info flows to which our modest individual lives are upended. \"No one to talk with? Do not worry, here's a pet robot that will fill your nostalgic needs of social bonding.\" Advertisement The power structure does not care about impoverishing people throughout the world through tremendous economic disruption and loss of intermediation structures; it pushes for even more disruption, impervious to the social crisis. It is urgent that we provide a new vision for human society because this disruption and endangerment of our natural information flow touches us deep, into our cells. Science has been particularly influential in creating these strange new problems -- and in leaving them unchecked! Science must now help find the conceptual tools to address this social unease all around us. Suzan Mazur : Would you talk a little bit about your role as chair of the Foundations of Information Science and would you define what you mean by the term \"information\"? Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : I co-founded the Foundations of Information Science with Michael Conrad more than 20 years ago -- we coined the name FIS in 1992. Michael Conrad was a very great man, enormously enthusiastic and engaging. Among Michael's many contributions to science, he was one of the first to attempt an evolutionary model of the \"vertical information flow\" in brain behavior. He passed away in 2000. Michael brought most of the specific scientific content to FIS, while the multidisciplinary vision of FIS was largely mine. Advertisement Suzan Mazur : What do you mean by the term \"information\"? I once interviewed physicist Sara Walker on the subject. She's a collaborator of Paul Davies at Arizona State University. Walker defined information as \"events that affect and direct the states of a dynamic system.\" How do you define it? Pedro Mariju\u00e1 n: The term is really undefinable because it's a relative term concerning the interaction between two entities -- the object and the subject. My favorite definition is \"distinction on the adjacent.\" You cannot have an informational relationship with anything that does not \"touch\" you in some way. In order to make any distinction, something has to be \"adjacent\" to you. This is biologically meaningful. I've based my informational scheme of the cell on this thinking of \"distinction on the adjacent\" -- where molecular recognition is the essential phenomenon over which biological complexity has been developed. Myriad distinctions are factually created in the different adjacency relationships between biomolecules within the living cell, organized in informational architectures. There are dedicated informational detectors in the cellular membrane and the cell is open to directly communicate with the environment. Signals from the environment are treated quite differently from metabolic items. This distinction is crucial and it has been not dealt with specifically in the literature except by John Gerhart and me (at least to my best knowledge). John Gerhart was a very good developmental biologist in the 1990s, he worked on signaling pathways and developmental toxicology, and rightly emphasized the difference between signals and metabolic inputs -- and seemingly nobody paid attention to him. Suzan Mazur : Is biosemiotics part of this? Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : Not really. Most of biosemiotics follows more or less directly the central dogma of Francis Crick, i.e., that information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. And this is like basic mechanics. This is mechanical information that the cell has, of course. Advertisement But, again, the cell communicates with the environment via specific signaling pathways. This is the essence of all prokaryotic activity. And this is the essence of multicellular development. The whole signaling system has enormous complexity, even in \"simple\" prokaryotes, as they have sophisticated signaling with the environment -- the \"1-2-3 component systems scheme.\" But the whole of biosemiotics, so to speak, is not founded on the ability to distinguish signals from the environment, to transduce them, and to build their meaning -- biosemiotics is mostly focused on abstracting transcription-translation flows. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Almost everybody has taken a shortcut in applying information views to life. Most have followed communication engineering ( Claude Shannon ). Others have taken the Turing machine view. Others von Neumann's operating system. And biosemiotics also is taking a shortcut, Peircean ( Charles Sanders Peirce , \"the father of pragmatism\") -- though the generalization may be unjust for some biosemiotic works. Nobody's doing the deep thinking about the central issue: How information pervades cellular self-production and cellular communication. How both aspects are elegantly intertwined in order to achieve a viable life cycle. Suzan Mazur : You're doing investigations into the dozens of signaling pathways, Wnt , Hedgehog, Notch, etc. Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : Yes, absolutely. We've written a couple of useful articles devoted to prokaryotic signaling and eukaryotic signaling on \"cellular intelligences,\" about how productive information flows and communicative information flows are handled intelligently, adaptively, around the essential core of the life cycle. . . . Suzan Mazur : How large is your foundation, FIS? Has it grown a lot over the last 20 years? Pedro Mariju\u00e1n : It's a public place, and I'm coordinating and promoting the discussion sessions. There is a healthy plurality of views. We conference online, and we meet every two years or so. Advertisement Europeans, Americans and scientists from other countries are well represented in FIS. We have a remarkable representation of Chinese intellectuals and scientists, who are very involved in information science and who are doing interesting philosophical research as well as introducing information science into their educational and research systems. One of the missions of FIS is organizing a sound body of new thinking about the informational cohesion of the physical, biological, and social realms. As a basis, a new vision of biological information is needed -- that's a personal concern of mine. Communicative cells, and the cell cycle, are central to this. The living cell in an organism doesn't know what to do. It needs some specific signals from the environment to advance in particular directions, even to continue with the \"inertia\" of its own cycle. So, the cell in the multicellular system scans multiple environmental cues to be told what to do. \"What should I do with my life?\" -- asks the cell. \"Oh, you should stop growing, says the environment. Oh, you should reproduce faster. Oh, you should differentiate. Oh, you should kill yourself.\" The cell continuously takes advice from the surrounding environment on what to do next, via its enormous multiplicity of signaling pathways. Like us via our own senses, and with all our conversation exchanges and social acquaintances around. . . .

Adorable Polar Bear Cub Nora Grows Up Before Your Very Eyes Cuteness alert! By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 6, 2016, 10:55 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING They grow up fast! It seems like only yesterday that Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Powell, Ohio, welcomed its newborn polar bear, weighing just 1 pound. Now the adorable cub -- who was named Nora this week after a public vote -- weighs 18 pounds and is up and about walking and running . Advertisement Footage posted online shows how she's matured since her birth on Nov. 6 last year. The zoo also uploaded this video where she's officially given her name , a combination of her dad's (Nanuq) and mom's (Aurora): A total of 88,061 votes were cast from across the world to decide on the moniker, according to the zoo. R ejected suggestions included Desna, meaning \"boss,\" Kaya, meaning \"little but wise\" and Sakari, meaning \"sweet.\" Advertisement \"We are thrilled and inspired that so many people around the world helped name this young polar bear,\" said zoo president and CEO Tom Stalf. \"We hope that those who have been watching Nora grow will continue to do so throughout her life, and remember that we all have a role to play in protecting wild polar bears for generations to come.\" A previous Facebook post revealed that the zoo's animal care staff were hand-rearing the cub after her mom stopped caring for her : Advertisement Staff continue to help, but the cub is becoming more independent every day, said the zoo's assistant curator, Shannon Morarity. Wild polar bears are found in the U.S., Canada, Russia, Greenland and Norway, and do not live in the Southern Hemisphere , according to the zoo's website. Advertisement Females live for an average 24.1 years and can grow to 8 feet tall and 550 pounds. Males live on average for 20.7 years and grow to 10 feet tall and 1,500 pounds. Disappearing sea ice is causing polar bear populations to plummet, with only 20,000 to 25,000 now in the wild.

A Furry Animal Shut Down The World's Largest Particle Collider, Officials Say The small mammal received a fatal lesson about electricity. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Apr 29, 2016, 04:42 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A furry creature solidified its place in the history of science on Thursday when it apparently gnawed through a transformer, shutting down the world\u2019s most powerful particle collider. Plans to restart the Large Hadron Collider , a 17-mile-long particle accelerator on the Swiss-French border, were delayed several days because of the wildlife incident and several other small factors, the Associated Press reports. Multiple news outlets identified the culprit as a weasel, but NPR notes that an official European Organization for Nuclear Research document suggests the animal may have been a marten . Advertisement The charred remains of the small beast were reportedly found by engineers investigating the situation, according to ABC News. Spokesman Arnaud Marsollier confirmed that the animal had died, the AP reports.

Galaxy's Mysterious 'Bubbles' Spew Gas At Two Million Miles An Hour Milky Way's Mysterious 'Bubbles' Yield Their Secrets By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jan 8, 2015, 09:03 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Five years after astronomers discovered a pair of mysterious plumes of radiation at the heart of our galaxy, scientists may be one step closer to understanding exactly what these ginormous \"bubbles\" are made of and how they came to be. The so-called \"Fermi Bubbles\" extend about 25,000 lights-years above and below the Milky Way's galactic plane and were first spotted in 2010 by NASA's gamma ray-detecting Fermi telescope . Scientists believe the bubbles are evidence of an ancient cataclysm at the Milky Way's center. Advertisement Now, a new study suggests the violent event occurred some 2.5 million to 4 million years ago, and that it blasted gas outward at speeds of up to two million miles an hour. (Story continues below image.) This graphic shows how NASA's Hubble Space Telescope probed light from a distant quasar to analyze the Fermi Bubbles. For the research, scientists at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore used instrumentation on the Hubble Space Telescope to study ultraviolet light from a faraway quasar as it passed through one of the bubbles--the astronomers liken this light to \" a needle piercing a balloon .\" The light carries information about the speed, composition, temperature, and mass of the gas that makes up the bubbles. Advertisement What did the scientists discover? In addition to gauging the speed of the expelled gas, they found it was made up of silicon, carbon, and aluminum--all of which are heavy elements produced inside stars. The researchers hope the new Hubble data will help them determine what caused the massive outburst, NASA says. One theory is that a group of stars fell into Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, which then \"belched\" out the gas. Another theory is that a spurt of star formation occurred near the Milky Way's galactic center, which produced gas-ejecting supernovas. Advertisement \"At the moment we cannot distinguish between these theories,\" Dr. Andrew Fox, an astronomer at the institute and the leader of the scientists who did the research, told The Huffington Post in an email, \"but that may change as we analyze more sightlines in our Hubble Space Telescope survey because then we can calculate the energetics of the outflow, and compare that with the theoretical predictions from the two models.\" As a next step, Fox and his team plan to examine the full spectrum of light from the quasar and study light from other quasars. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By studying the light from the other quasars in our program, we may be able to detect the ancient remnants of previous outflows.\" Advertisement The new research has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and was presented on Jan. 5 at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle.

Researchers Find More Women Buried At Stonehenge Than Men \"As far as the burials go, women were as prominent there as men.\" By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Feb 7, 2016, 05:39 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Archaeologists say they have discovered the cremated remains of 14 women, believed to have been of high status, buried beneath Stonehenge. Wojtek Skora via Getty Images Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of 14 women, believed to be of elite status, buried at the iconic prehistoric monument of Stonehenge. The remarkable discovery was announced in the latest publication of British Archaeology, and the findings suggest a gender-equal society thousands of years ago. Advertisement \"The archaeology now shows that as far as the burials go, women were as prominent there as men. This contrasts with the earlier burial mounds, where men seem to be more prominent,\" archaeologist Mike Pitts, who edits the publication, told Discovery News. Christie Willis, a fellow researcher at the British site, told Discovery News the remains were those of 14 females and nine males.

He believes that with the latest discovery, the view of Stonehenge may drastically change. According to the publication, the Neolithic site is the country's largest prehistoric cremation cemetery, and burials there were likely reserved for those of higher status. Pitts said researchers used high-tech tools like CT scans to better piece together the cremated remains. Advertisement Researchers also found other items at the site, such as long, slender bones they believe were used as hairpins.

Penguins Find Their Moment In The Spotlight With A Video 'Selfie' These curious birds were caught on camera in Antarctica. By Carol Kuruvilla Religion Reporter, HuffPost Mar 9, 2018, 05:26 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A screenshot of a video taken at the Auster Rookery in Antarctica. Australian Antarctic Division / Facebook Two emperor penguins in Antarctica have waddled their way into the international spotlight thanks to an unintentional video \u201cselfie.\u201d The inquisitive creatures were captured on film investigating a camera left behind by the Australian Antarctic expeditioner Eddie Gault at the Auster Rookery. Advertisement \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for the naturally curious birds to seize the opportunity for a selfie,\u201d the Australian Antarctic Division wrote in a Facebook post about the video. In the brief footage, one particularly nosy bird walks over to the camera and kicks it so that the lens faces up, giving humans a view of the animals typically reserved for the birds\u2019 prey, the Antarctic silverfish. Advertisement Another penguin shuffles into view soon after. Both animals spend some time peeking at the lens over their long beaks before their attention drifts away. The video was captured near Australia\u2019s Mawson station , one of the oldest continuously operating bases in Antarctica. The video, not technically a \u201cselfie\u201d since the camera was rolling before the birds commenced their inquiry, captured the interest of thousands online. The Australian Antarctic Division posted the video to its social media channels Wednesday, calling it a \u201cpenguin selfie.\u201d It has accumulated more than 132,000 Facebook views and more than 6,000 retweets. Advertisement The two stars are already rare birds \u2015 but rapidly warming air and sea temperatures may make them even rarer. Climate change threatens to make their habitats inhospitable, and some scientists predict the birds\u2019 population may diminish drastically by the year 2100.

With that warmth comes a surprising twist: Unusually warm Arctic winter temperatures are linked to bitter cold and snow in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the northeastern U.S., parts of northern Europe and northern Asia, according to an analysis of 66 years\u2019 worth of climate data. Advertisement And the relationship between Arctic warmth and severe winter weather was strongest in in the northeastern U.S. \u2014 in fact, a temperature spike in the Arctic meant that the U.S. Northeast was two to four times more likely than usual to experience a bout of extreme winter weather, the scientists reported in a new study. [ The 10 Worst Blizzards in US History ] Past climate projections predicted that, in a warming world, winters would be the seasons to heat up the fastest \u2014 and yet recent winters in the Northern Hemisphere were more severe than scientists anticipated, said Judah Cohen, the study\u2019s lead author and director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, an organization that assesses risks from weather events and climate change. To understand what might be driving these unusual episodes, Cohen and his colleagues looked at pulses of warmth in the Arctic during winter months, to see how they lined up against weather anomalies elsewhere in the globe. \u201cWhen the Arctic pulse is warm, you tend to get an increase in occurrences of extreme winter weather across the midlatitudes, including the eastern U.S., northern Europe and northern Asia,\u201d Cohen told Live Science. The relationship between spiking Arctic warmth and pockets of cold to the south was \u201creally, really strong\u201d \u2014 and it was strongest in the eastern U.S., Cohen said. Since 1990, the eastern U.S. has been visited by winter storms so severe that they earned highly dramatic nicknames, such as \u201cSnowzilla,\u201d \u201cSnowmaggeddon\u201d and \u201cSnowpocalypse.\u201d The increase in incidences of extreme storms with heavy snowfall corresponded with periods of excessive Arctic warmth, the study authors wrote. Disruption comes in waves How does this relationship work? As the scientists\u2019 observations reflected only the comparison of weather patterns over time \u2014 and not what was driving them\u2014 the researchers could not conclude that a warmer Arctic was directly responsible for harsh winter storms in the U.S., they reported in the study. But answers may lie in another atmospheric disturbance linked to a warming Arctic, Cohen said. According to the study, data from past decades showed that fall snow cover in Siberia increased as the Arctic warmed, which cooled northeastern Eurasia. Meanwhile, melting sea ice fueled warmer temperatures in northwestern Eurasia. These air-temperature changes close to the surface led to similar changes higher up in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affected the jet stream \u2014 a conveyer belt of wind that carries warm air and moisture around the globe \u2014 by increasing its \u201cwaviness,\u201d making jetstream waves dive farther south and stretch farther to the north. In turn, this extra amplification can alter the movement of cold air masses near the pole, otherwise known as the polar vortex , Cohen explained. And this disturbance of the polar vortex could end up shaping conditions that worsen winter weather in the U.S. \u201cThe cold air that\u2019s normally confined to the Arctic, it\u2019s kind of dammed in by the polar vortex itself \u2014 because winds normally blow from west to east inside the polar vortex, so it acts as barrier, keeps the cold air to the north and the mild air to the south,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhen it breaks down, the cold air that\u2019s penned up in the Arctic spills to lower latitudes, and that\u2019s when you get those episodes of severe winter weather.\u201d Arctic scientists like to say that \u201cwhat happens in the Arctic doesn\u2019t stay in the Arctic,\u201d but the interconnectivity between Earth\u2019s dynamic atmospheric systems is no laughing matter, Cohen said. The complexity of these systems is reflected in emerging disruptions that are likely the products of climate change, though there is still much to be learned about how climate change could shape weather patterns around the world, the study authors reported. \u201cI\u2019d argue that our expectations for climate change were overly simplistic,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIt was kind of expected that if you warm the Arctic, the only thing that\u2019s going to lead to is just milder temperatures everywhere \u2014 and that\u2019s not a complete picture.\u201d The findings were published online today (March 13) in the journal Nature Communications .

Homo Sapiens' Sex With Extinct Species Was No One-Night Stand Scientists say ancient bed-hopping has left a mark on the human genome. Reuters Mar 19, 2016, 11:22 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists say early Homo sapiens mated with both Neanderthals, depicted in this image, and the mysterious extinct human species known as Denisovans. TOM MCHUGH via Getty Images WASHINGTON, March 18 (Reuters) - Our species, Homo sapiens , has a more adventurous sexual history than previously realized, and all that bed-hopping long ago has left an indelible mark on the human genome. Scientists said on Friday an analysis of genetic information on about 1,500 people from locations around the world indicated at least four interbreeding episodes tens of thousands of years ago, three with our close cousins the Neanderthals and one with the mysterious extinct human species known as Denisovans. Advertisement People living on the remote equatorial islands of Melanesia represented the only population found to possess an appreciable level of Denisovan genetic ancestry. These Melanesians, like most human populations, also had Neanderthal genetic ancestry. The researchers found some of the genes inherited from these extinct species were beneficial for our species. Many are involved in the immune system and likely helped protect against pathogens, and some play important roles in skin and hair biology, said University of Washington evolutionary geneticist Joshua Akey, who helped lead the study published in the journal Science. Advertisement The researchers analyzed DNA sequences from 35 people living on Northern Island Melanesia off the coast of New Guinea. These Melanesians were found to have about 2 percent Neanderthal ancestry plus an additional genetic contribution of roughly 2 to 4 percent from Denisovans. The non-African populations studied had roughly 1.5 to 4 percent Neanderthal genetic ancestry, Akey said. African populations do not have either Neanderthal or Denisovan ancestry because those two species were never on that continent. Denisovans, discovered in the past decade, are known only from a pinky finger bone and two teeth from a northern Siberian cave. Advertisement The robust, large-browed Neanderthals prospered across Europe and Asia from about 350,000 years ago until disappearing shortly after 40,000 years ago. Less is known about the Denisovans. The fact that the only known Denisovan remains come from northern Siberia but that their genetic contribution is seen in people living far away in Melanesia suggests Denisovans had a broad geographic range extending across Asia, Akey said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Binghamton University molecular anthropologist D. Andrew Merriwether said the researchers also detected a contribution to people's genome from a fourth, unknown source. Advertisement \"So this paints a picture of probably at least four species of hominins (our species and extinct human species) alive at the same time and interbreeding at times over the last 100,000 years. Definitely not something most people supposed before 10 years ago,\" Merriwether said.

China Is Genetically Engineering Mini Pigs To Sell As Pets The $1,600 mini pigs are created using gene-editing techniques and cloning. By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Oct 4, 2015, 09:42 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT We'd all like our baby pets to stay perpetually tiny, but scientists in China are taking that desire to a whole new level. BGI, a genomics institute located in Shenzhen, announced in late September that it is genetically engineering miniature pigs to sell as pets for $1,600 each. BGI's genetically engineered pigs are not to be confused with teacup pigs (pictured above, on the right), which, according to The Dodo, are actually stunted potbellied pigs . John Phillips via Getty Images Advertisement The institute creates the micropigs by using a gene-editing technique that alters the genomes of a Bama -- an already small breed of pig -- to make it even smaller. BGI uses TALENs ( an enzyme ) to disable one of two copies of the growth hormone receptor gene in a Bama's fetal cells. BGI then clones pigs from the fetus, which produces stunted male Bama clones that are, in turn, naturally bred with normal females . Half of the resulting offspring are micropigs. Unlike normal Bamas -- which can weigh up to 100 pounds -- these lab-created pigs only grow up to 30 pounds when mature , around the same weight as a medium-sized dog. Advertisement The micropigs were originally used as lab animals that acted as models for human disease , according to Nature magazine. Pigs, specifically smaller breeds of pig , are commonly used as model organisms in biomedical research because they \" closely [resemble] man in anatomy, physiology and genetics ,\" according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. In 2005, the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, and ProLinia Inc. produced healthy cloned piglets (shown above) from the skin cells of a commercial hog. Erik S. Lesser via Getty Images According to Yong Li, technical director of BGI's animal-science platform, BGI has not observed any health problems associated with cloning in any of the gene-edited pigs they've produced. Advertisement In the future, the institute promises to offer miniature pigs in a variety of coat colors and patterns, which will be achieved through further gene editing. While BGI feels confident about bringing genetically modified micropigs to the public, other experts remain skeptical. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

There is a high chance they could get into the wild and offset an ecosystem if they happen to have an advantageous trait. Lab rats and mice are kept out of pet stores for this reason.\" Advertisement For its part, BGI says that the profits made from selling the micropigs as pets will be invested in research that explores how gene editing in pets and in medical research can be regulated.

Vast Chamber Of Molten Rock Discovered Under Yellowstone 'Supervolcano' Massive Magma Chamber Discovered Under Yellowstone By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 28, 2015, 09:44 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The giant \"supervolcano\" that lies beneath Yellowstone National Park is hiding a deep secret: a massive chamber containing enough hot, partly molten rock to fill the Grand Canyon more than 11 times over. The newfound chamber (see below) sits 12 to 28 miles beneath the supervolcano and is four times bigger than a shallower chamber above it that scientists already knew about . Advertisement \u201cFor the first time, we have imaged the continuous volcanic plumbing system under Yellowstone ,\u201d Dr. Hsin-Hua Huang, a postdoctoral researcher in geology and geophysics at the University of Utah and a member of the team of seismologists who discovered the vast chamber, said in a written statement. \u201cThat includes the upper crustal magma chamber we have seen previously plus a lower crustal magma reservoir that has never been imaged before and that connects the upper chamber to the Yellowstone hotspot plume below.\u201d This cross-section illustration cutting southwest-northeast under Yellowstone depicts the newfound, blob-shaped magma chamber under the Yellowstone supervolcano. Rare eruptions. Is all of this magma something to worry about? The researchers said in the statement that the discovery doesn't mean pockets of magma are growing larger -- or that the supervolcano is about to erupt. The chance of a supervolcano eruption happening in any given year is 1 in 700,000, and the last major eruption was 640,000 years ago . Advertisement But the discovery gives scientists a better understanding of Yellowstone's complex subsurface \"plumbing\" system that carries hot and partly molten rock upward. The upper magma chamber powers Yellowstone National Park's geysers and was responsible for three ancient volcanic eruptions that coated much of North America in ash, the Associated Press reported. \u201cEvery additional thing we learn about the Yellowstone volcanic system is one more piece in the puzzle, and that gets us closer to really understanding how the volcanic system works ,\u201d Dr. Fan-Chi Lin, an assistant professor of geology and geophysics at the university and another member of the research team, told Smithsonian. \u201cIf we could better understand the transport properties of magmatic fluids, we could get a better understanding of the timing and, therefore, where we are in the volcanic cycle.\u201d Earthquake data. The researchers used instruments called seismometers to measure the seismic waves generated by earthquakes in order to determine the type of rocky material deep beneath Yellowstone. The researchers examined data from quakes in Utah, Idaho, the Teton Range, and Yellowstone itself as well as data from distant temblors. Advertisement Science magazine reported that 11 seismometers were used to analyze the more distant and deep quakes, while 69 seismometers were used to gather data from more local and shallower quakes. \"To be able to image lower crustal structure, we needed to combine a huge amount of observations from both distant earthquakes and local earthquakes ,\" Dr. Jamie Farrell, a postdoctoral researcher at the university and another member of the team, told Live Science. \"Our study opens up many new directions and future opportunities in volcano research... For example, it will be interesting to see if the existence of the lower crustal magma reservoir is a common feature for all the volcanic systems around the globe.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Nov 26, 2015, 09:32 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Eric Raptosh Photography via Getty Images From the farthest reaches of the cosmos to the curious behavior of subatomic particles, science helps us understand our universe. But science can console as well as explain. How does it do that ? By helping us realize that some of our everyday problems are actually pretty puny. Advertisement Consider these 10 common annoyances and some super-awesome scientific facts that help put things in perspective: 1. This weather is absolutely unbearable . Yes, Earth can get really hot sometimes -- and really cold. And pretty stormy. But the weather is worse elsewhere in the solar system. If you lived on the side of Mercury that faces the sun , for example, you'd be coping with temperatures of 426 degrees Celsius -- or almost 799 degrees Fahrenheit. It's even hotter on Venus, which unlike Mercury has a heat-trapping atmosphere. And get this: on Neptune, the winds blow at 1,600 miles an hour , the temperature can drop to -201 Celsius (-330 Fahrenheit), and the seasons last more than 40 years . Advertisement 2. You cut yourself shaving. OK, so you nicked a blood vessel. Did you know an adult body contains about 100,000 miles of blood vessels ? 3. You dropped your glasses in the deep end of the pool. Good thing you didn't drop them in the deepest part of the ocean ! That would be the Mariana Trench, in the Pacific Ocean. It's an almost unfathomable 11,034 meters deep -- almost seven miles down. ASSOCIATED PRESS Advertisement 4. It took forever for that elevator to come. Forever? A few minutes isn't much when you consider the universe is 13.8 billion years old . And even that's not forever. 5. You got caught doing 70 in a 55-mph zone. Next time that happens, maybe you should tell the officer at least you weren't going the speed of light -- 186,000 miles per second. Just how fast is that? If you could travel that fast, you could circle the earth at the equator 7.5 times in a single second . Of course, if you really could go that fast, you wouldn't have to worry about getting caught by a traffic cop. 6. You got a pebble in your shoe. A pebble, you say? About the size of a pea? Be glad it wasn't something bigger -- like maybe one of the biggest things in the observable universe , which is a so-called \"large quasar group,\" or LQG, discovered in 2013. It spans a distance of four billion light-years, or 24 sextillion miles. Advertisement An artist's impression of a very distant quasar. European Southern Observatory/Flickr 7. My boyfriend isn't very romantic. Maybe so, but at least he's not a hippopotamus. Male hippos \"tail flick\" their feces as a territorial display. 8. You have heartburn. Heartburn is what happens when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, and it's no fun. But think how much worse you would feel if your stomach were filled not with the hydrochloric acid that occurs naturally in your stomach but with fluoroantimonic acid . It's been called the world's strongest acid, and is 100,000 billion billion billion times more potent than the stuff in your stomach. Ouch! Advertisement 9. The dog ate your homework. Bad dog! But lucky for you, you're not living with a \"bad whale.\" Blue whales, the biggest animals ever to have lived on our planet , can weigh 200 tons -- and consume four tons of krill every day. No telling how many pages of notebook paper it would take to fill one up. 10. Your friend's new engagement ring is bigger than yours. No matter how big her rock is, it's no match for BPM 37093, a.k.a. Lucy. What's that, you say? It's a star that's made of diamond . Located in the constellation Centaurus, Lucy has 10 billion trillion trillion carats. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's How Rats End Up In Toilet Bowls Fun fact: Rats can hold their breath for up to three minutes. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 18, 2015, 03:39 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT If you don't like rats, you might want to sit down for this -- but maybe don't sit on the toilet. Intrigued by the question of how rats make it into toilet bowls (and yes, it does happen ), National Geographic put together this brief video tracing the rodents' paths from street to sewer, sewer to indoor plumbing and, ultimately, into the toilet. Perhaps the most incredible part is how easily a rat can navigate the sharp 180-degree U-turn within the actual toilet pipes, all while underwater. Watch the video below: Per National Geographic, rats are naturally strong swimmers and can tread water for three straight days, paddling underwater with their back legs while the front paws steer. They can also hold their breath for up to three minutes. Advertisement Rats also have unique ribs that flex around joints along their spines, the video notes. This allows the creatures to compress their ribcages to fit through small openings, thereby navigating pipes with ease. Of course, rats take advantage of far easier routes into houses as well. According to the New York State Department of Health , the rodents can even squeeze through the quarter-inch gap underneath a door. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Listen To Sally Ride Talk To Gloria Steinem About Facing Sexism As An Astronaut Plus there's a beautifully animated film to bring life to the 1983 conversation. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 4, 2016, 02:25 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A new video provides a rare glimpse into astronaut Sally Ride's views on being the first American woman in space. Journalist and feminist icon Gloria Steinem interviewed the astronaut in 1983 about making history earlier that year. PBS Digital Studios found a recording of it in Smith College's archives and turned the interview into a seven-minute animated video (above) for its \"Blank on Blank\" series. Advertisement \"I wish that there had been another woman on my flight,\" Ride's voice says in the video, which was posted to YouTube this week. \"I think it would have been a lot easier.\" She then revealed how nearly every journalist who interviewed her had questions about the bathroom facilities in space, and what kind of makeup she planned to pack for her mission. \"The only bad moments in our training involved the press,\" she said. \"The press was an added pressure on the flight for me, and whereas NASA appeared to be very enlightened about flying women astronauts, the press didn't appear to be.\" Advertisement Sound familiar? In 2014, a reporter asked Russian cosmonaut Yelena Serova how she planned to style her hair in space. Serova replied, \"Aren't you interested in the hairstyles of my colleagues?\" Ride surely would have been proud of Serova's retort.

Scientists Reveal Secret Behind Army Ants' Bridge-Building Ways The research could inspire new robotics. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 26, 2015, 09:29 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Ants are pretty awesome. They clump up into islands to survive floods . They construct ginormous colonies . They even do acrobatics to build bridges (above) -- and now scientists have figured out exactly how. Army ants construct complex bridges from their own bodies to span crevices as they move across tropical forest floors in Central America, and they adjust their bridges for efficiency based on a cost-benefit trade-off, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday. Advertisement \"For the first time, we show how army ants can build long suspended bridges between locations that cannot be spanned by one or two ants only,\" Simon Garnier, a researcher at New Jersey Institute of Technology and a co-author of the study, said in an email. Researchers inspect the Y-shaped apparatus. Bastian Sauer For the study, the researchers made a Y-shaped platform to mimic a gap in the trail of army ants in Barro Colorado Island, Panama and then filmed time-lapse videos of the ants traveling across the platform. Advertisement The researchers noticed that at first, the ants formed their bridge across the narrow side of the Y-shaped apparatus so as to use as few workers as possible. But then they realize that to create the shortest path for those crossing the bridge, they must move out to the wider side of the Y. The ants benefit from shorter traveling distances, the researchers said, but they also incur a cost by sequestering workers that could be used for other important tasks, like catching food or transporting the young. Advertisement The researchers concluded that the ants do a sort of \"cost-benefit analysis.\" When the bridge reaches a happy middle ground of making a short path while not occupying too many ants, the bridge-building stops, Garnier said. When the bridge is no longer needed, the ants in the bridge disassemble. This research goes far beyond the forest floor. It \"could serve as a template to design self-assembling machines and self-repairing robotic swarms,\" Garnier said. \"Slowly moving away from a starting point and progressively lengthening by addition of new workers, before stopping, suspended in mid-air -- was never described before.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Neil deGrasse Tyson To Host Late-Night Cable Talk Show On National Geographic Channel Neil deGrasse Tyson To Host Late-Night Talk Show By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jan 8, 2015, 04:19 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Neil deGrasse Tyson is adding another title to his long list of roles: late-night talk show host. The astronomer, author, frequent TV guest, pop culture personality and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History will host a weekly show on the National Geographic Channel starting in April. The program will be based on his popular \"Star Talk\" podcast and carry the same name, the network announced on Wednesday. It'll also have a similar format and freewheeling-style. Advertisement \" It\u2019s a mixture of comedy, science and pop culture . I\u2019m the host, yet I\u2019m the scientist! And my guests are hardly ever scientists,\" Tyson said at Winter TV Press Tour 2015, according to Deadline.com. \"Our goal is to hew them from pop culture.\" Along with those guests, each episode will feature a one-minute rant from Bill Nye in the style of the old Andy Rooney segments on \"60 Minutes,\" The Hollywood Reporter said. An announcement on the website of the \"Star Talk\" podcast said the shows would be filmed before a studio audience at the Hayden Planetarium. Advertisement \"That\u2019s all we\u2019re allowed to say about the TV show so far -\u2013 but I can tell you that the lineup of guests that I\u2019ve seen is pretty spectacular ,\" wrote Jeffrey Simons, director of social media for \"Star Talk.\" The Wall Street Journal reports that one of his guests will be evolutionary biologist and noted atheist Richard Dawkins, although Tyson insists it's not to generate controversy. \u201c The goal is for you to learn, not to watch a fight ,\u201d Tyson was quoted as saying. The show is also something of a followup to \"Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,\" a modern spin on Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\" series that was broadcast last spring on Fox. Advertisement \u201c'Cosmos' allowed us to share the awesome power of the universe with a global audience in ways that we never thought possible,\u201d Tyson said in a news release. \u201c To be able to continue to spread wonder and excitement through 'Star Talk,' which is a true passion project for me, is beyond exciting .\u201d Last month, \"Cosmos\" producer Seth MacFarlane hinted on Twitter that the show could be resurrected for another season . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Mysterious 'Cold Spot' May Be The Largest Structure In The Universe Astronomers Discover What May Be The Biggest Thing In The Universe By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Apr 27, 2015, 08:41 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Astronomers are crowing about the discovery of what they say just might be \"the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity .\" Advertisement It's not a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies--nor even a galaxy supercluster . It's not even a structure in the usual sense. Rather, it's a vast cosmic bubble of sorts--a roughly spherical \"supervoid\" some 1.8 billion light-years across. (Story continues below image.) The Cold Spot is in the constellation Eridanus. Graphics by Gerg\u0151 Kr\u00e1nicz. Image credit: ESA Planck Collaboration. What makes the bubble different from the surrounding regions of the universe? There's no barrier--it's just that the density of galaxies is significantly lower inside the supervoid than outside. \" Supervoids are not entirely empty , they're under-dense,\" Dr. Andras Kovacs, of Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary, and one of the researchers behind for the discovery, told Popular Science. In fact, the Guardian reported, some 100,000 galaxies are \"missing\" from the supervoid. Advertisement A cosmic riddle. The discovery helps explain a mystery that dates back to 2004, when astronomers examining a map of the radiation left over after the Big Bang--the so-called cosmic microwave background (CMB)--noticed a big and unusually cold region of sky in the southern hemisphere constellation Eridanus . It wasn't particularly surprising to discover a cold spot in the sky, according to a written statement released by the University of Hawaii. But this one--which astronomers dubbed, well, the Cold Spot --was far bigger and far colder than others. Astronomers didn't know what to make of it. \"The Cold Spot raised a lot of eyebrows,\" Prof. Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at the University of Durham in England who was not involved in the research, told The Guardian. \"The real question was what was causing it and whether it was a challenge to orthodoxy.\u201d Advertisement If the Cold Spot originated with the Big Bang, it might be a sign of some exotic physics that modern cosmological theory simply doesn't explain, according to the University of Hawaii statement. On the other hand, the Cold Spot might simply be evidence of a relatively empty region of space between us and the CMB. It all lines up. The discovery of the supervoid suggests that the latter explanation is the likely one. As Dr. Istvan Szapudi, an astrophysicist at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy in Manoa and another of the scientists involved in the research, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"While we did not establish a causal relationship [between the Cold Spot and the supervoid], the fact that two very rare objects are aligned makes it very likely that they have something to do with each other.\" Szapudi, Kovacs, and their collaborators made the discovery using optical data from the Pan-STARRS telescope on the Hawaiian island of Maui and infrared data from NASA's Wide Field Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite. Combing both sets of observations allowed the astronomers to estimate the distance to and position of each galaxy in that part of the sky. The supervoid is about 3 billion light-years from the Earth. A paper describing the research was published online April 20 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Homo Naledi may be Two Million Years Old (Give or Take) There has been global interest in the announcement of new fossils from a cave called Rising Star in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site in South Africa. These fossils may represent a new species of the genus Homo.

Origin of man, Vector Illustration Francis Thackeray , University of the Witwatersrand There has been global interest in the announcement of new fossils from a cave called Rising Star in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site in South Africa. These fossils were recently reported by Lee Berger and his team, who described the discovery of more than 1500 fossils as representing a new species of the genus Homo. It has been called Homo naledi, associated with a name for star in the Sesotho language. Advertisement But the age of Homo naledi is not yet known with certainty. The new species has not yet been dated. Unsuccessful attempts had been made by Paul Dirks and members of the Rising Star team to obtain an age. They used techniques applied previously to date a range of fossils. These included Australopithecus africanus, such as the famous \"Mrs Ples\" skull, as more than two million years old, and fossils of Paranthropus robustus and Homo erectus . In a new paper in the South African Journal of Science I suggest that Homo naledi lived two million years ago (plus or minus 500,000 years). If shown to be correct, this will help to place Homo naledi in the family tree of human relatives. The variance is based on the fact that the earliest date for Homo rudolfensis is about 2.5 million years, and the date for certain African Homo erectus samples is about 1.5 million years. Advertisement Although different, Homo naledi is most similar to fossils attributed to Homo habilis (about 1.8 million years old), and to a lesser extent to fossils of Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus. Taken together I am suggesting that Homo naledi is in the order of two million years old, with upper and lower limits of about 1.5 and 2.5 million years respectively. Why is dating so important Estimating the age of fossils is important because it allows palaeoanthropologists the opportunity to try to draw up a family tree. It shows the evolutionary relationships of distant relatives. Advertisement Some of the fossil species can be considered to represent possible ancestors of our own species, Homo sapiens, while other species such as Paranthropus robustus can be considered to be evolutionary \"dead ends\". The big question being asked is: where does Homo naledi fit in the evolutionary tree? It had a small brain of about 500 cubic centimetres in volume. This makes it similar to fossils of Australopithecus. On the other hand, bones of parts of the skeleton, especially the foot, indicate that this species was in some respect remarkably like Homo. Dating such enigmatic fossils is crucial for an understanding of evolutionary relationships of Homo naledi, compared to more than ten other species which are recognised by palaeontologists. Advertisement My approach has been to assess the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between skulls. This can help to assess the age and affinities of fossils. Quantifying degrees of similarity between fossils Recognising that the new fossils have features of both Australopithecus and Homo, we need to know how old they are. One way of addressing this is to use a technique that I have previously described, based on measurements of skulls . Statistics are calculated by taking one set of measurements for specimen A, plotted against the corresponding measurements of specimen B. When A and B are the same species, the values for the two specimens are typically distributed along a straight line, with little scatter around that linear pattern. Advertisement When measurements of two specimens (C and D) of different species are plotted against each other, there is a high degree of scatter. The degree of scatter around the line can be quantified using a statistic that I have called log sem, based on a standard mathematical technique that is known as least squares linear regression. Remarkably, a pattern has been found for comparisons of modern skulls of the same species, whether these are of mammals, birds or reptiles. The mean log sem value for comparisons of pairs of modern species has central tendency around a particular number with a value of -1.61 (plus or minus 0.1), which I have regarded as an approximation of a biological species constant called T . How does this help to date Homo naledi Comparisons have been made between the skull measurements of Homo naledi and those of more than ten other recognised species. Advertisement It is possible to say that Homo naledi is indeed different because in all cases the log sem statistics for such comparisons is significantly greater than -1.61. But what is exciting is the fact that of all such comparisons, Homo naledi is most similar to skulls attributed to Homo habilis known to date to about 1.8 million years, and to some extent to other fossils attributed to Homo rudolfensis between about two and 2.5 million years ago. To a smaller extent Homo naledi is similar to fossil skulls of Homo erectus between about 1.5 and 1.8 million years ago. Using these results, based on comparisons of skulls, I suggest that Homo naledi is two million years old, plus or minus 500,000 years.

Watch Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano Spew Lava Into The Pacific Ocean It's impossible to predict how long it will last. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Jul 29, 2016, 11:24 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Thrill-seekers are flocking to the Hawaii coast, where lava is flowing from the Kilauea Volcano into the Pacific Ocean for the first time since 2013. The lava stream spanned 6.5 miles when it reached the water on Tuesday morning , CNN reports. The flow started in May. Advertisement Plumes of steam can be seen rising from the coast as the lava crashes into the water and begins cooling into rock. Janet Babb, a spokeswoman for the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that it is impossible to predict exactly how long the stream will last . Kilauea has been active since 1983 . The natural wonder has quickly become a destination for people hoping to catch a glimpse of the lava as it reaches the ocean.

Iconic Physicist Stephen Hawking Dies At 76 \"We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe,\" Hawking once remarked, \"and for that, I am extremely grateful.\" By Joe Satran Staff Writer and Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Mar 13, 2018, 11:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Stephen Hawking died Wednesday after complications due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive neurodegenerative disease. He was 76. The world-renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist was best known for his work on black holes. Hawking theorized that, contrary to the prevailing scientific belief that black holes were inescapable for all forms of matter and energy, they actually emitted a form of radiation \u2015 now known as Hawking radiation. He also played a key role in the mathematical effort to unify Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity with the emergent field of quantum physics. Advertisement Hawking used his position as one of the world\u2019s most famous scientists as a platform to discuss a wide range of issues, from the existence of extraterrestrial life to the nature of philosophy . He skyrocketed to public prominence in 1988, when he published his first general-audience book, A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes . The cosmology treatise has sold approximately 10 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling science books of all time. In 1963, when he was just 21 years old, Hawking was famously diagnosed with the debilitating motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Though 80 percent of those with ALS die within five years of diagnosis, and Hawking\u2019s own doctors gave him roughly two years to live , he survived for decades, perhaps longer than any other patient with the disease in medical history . Hawking used a wheelchair to move around and a sophisticated computer system to speak for much of his time as a public figure. The physicist\u2019s inspiring \u2015 and turbulent \u2015 personal story was dramatized in the 2014 movie \u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d which was based on a memoir by Hawking\u2019s first wife, Jane Wilde. Actor Eddie Redmayne\u2019s portrayal of Hawking in the film won him an Oscar for best actor.

Fred Duval/FilmMagic via Getty Images Hawking was born on Jan. 8, 1942 \u2015 the 300th anniversary of Galileo\u2019s death \u2015 in Oxford, England, to Frank, a physician specializing in tropical disease , and Isobel, a medical secretary . He and his three younger siblings grew up mostly in the town of St. Albans, just north of London, in what has been described as a highly intellectually-engaged home. At the St. Albans School, Hawking was an indifferent student, preferring to spend his time playing board games and tinkering with computers. But he nonetheless gained admittance to his father\u2019s alma mater, University College at Oxford University, in 1959, at the age of 17. Advertisement Upon arriving at Oxford, Hawking toyed with the idea of studying either math or medicine before eventually settling on physics. His attitude toward academic work remained lackadaisical in college. He rarely attended lectures and has said that he spent only 1,000 hours on studies during his three years at Oxford, or just an hour a day. Still, Hawking\u2019s natural brilliance started to shine through as an undergraduate \u2015 and he apparently felt that his tutors resented him for doing so well with so little work. When he submitted his final thesis, it was given a grade on the border between first-class honors and second-class honors, so Hawking had to face an oral exam that would determine his grade. Knowing his reputation, he reportedly told his examiners , \u201cIf you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First.\u201d He got a First. And, as promised, Hawking enrolled in graduate school at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1962, studying under the physicist Dennis Sciama and the famed astronomer Fred Hoyle. He became interested in the then-nascent study of black holes and singularities, the existence of which had been implied by Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.

After Hawking lost his voice to pneumonia the prior year, computer scientist Walter Woltosz gave him a device that helped him vocalize words that he typed. Associated Press While studying at Cambridge, Hawking met Wilde, a fellow St. Albans native who was a student in modern languages at Westfield College in London at the time. Before the two started dating, Hawking collapsed while ice skating and couldn\u2019t get up. His mother made him go to the doctor, who diagnosed him with ALS and estimated he had just over two years to live . Years later, during a symposium at Cambridge on his 70th birthday , Hawking reflected on how much he struggled to stay motivated after his diagnosis. Why work so hard for a Ph.D. when you could be dead in two years? Advertisement \u201cHowever difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.\u201d - Stephen Hawking, as he celebrated his 70th birthday \u201cRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet,\u201d he said. \u201cTry to make sense of what you see and about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. It matters that you don\u2019t just give up.\u201d Hawking\u2019s motor control deteriorated rapidly; he was soon walking to class on crutches. Yet the disease spurred him to deepen his relationship with Wilde quickly. They married in 1965. Advertisement After receiving his doctorate in cosmology, Hawking stayed at Cambridge to continue studying some of the most essential questions about the structure of the universe. In 1968, a year after Jane gave birth their eldest son, Robert, Hawking took a post at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge and began the mature phase of his academic career. Over the next decade, Hawking published a string of groundbreaking papers on cosmology and theoretical physics that made him a celebrity in the scientific community. He and English mathematician Roger Penrose wrote key papers in the late 1960s that related the Big Bang \u2015 the event that created the universe \u2015 and black holes, proving that both were the result of singularities in the fabric of space-time. In the early 1970s, Hawking and several other physicists co-wrote a proof of the hypothesis that all black holes can be described in terms of just their mass, angular momentum and electric charge . Advertisement It was in 1974 that Hawking proposed what is widely considered his most significant theory: that black holes can emit subatomic particles , now known as Hawking radiation. Prior to his paper, physicists had been sure that nothing could escape the crushing gravity of a black hole. The existence of Hawking radiation also implies that black holes can eventually wither away and die , something that had previously been inconceivable to scientists. Soon after publishing his paper, Hawking, just 32 years old, was named a fellow of the prestigious Royal Society . He briefly taught at the California Institute of Technology before assuming the position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a post dating back more than 400 years that was once held by Isaac Newton. Though Hawking\u2019s family life flourished during this time \u2015 he and Jane Hawking went on to have two more children \u2015 his health did not. He reluctantly started using a wheelchair in 1969, and by the mid-70s, he could no longer feed or clothe himself. Advertisement Stephen Hawking on a trip to Cape Finisterre in Spain in 2008. The scientist married and divorced twice and had three children. MIGUEL RIOPA/Getty Images In 1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia while on a trip to Switzerland. Doctors performed a tracheotomy that allowed him to breathe but rendered him unable to speak naturally. At first, he communicated using word cards, which was agonizingly slow. But in 1986, computer scientist Walter Woltosz gave him a device that would vocalize words he typed using a joystick. Hawking called this system, which has since been upgraded several times, \u201cThe Computer .\u201d Its electronic voice was an integral part of the physicist\u2019s public image. Hawking first came up with the idea of writing a book about cosmology for a general audience in 1982 . He said he conceived of the project to \u201cearn money to pay [his] daughter\u2019s school fees.\u201d The first draft of A Brief History of Time was finished in 1984, but Hawking\u2019s publisher felt it was too difficult for laypeople to understand, so he went back to work. The revision process became more complicated after Hawking lost his voice in 1985, but he managed to publish the book in 1988. Advertisement It was a massive hit: The book was on The New York Times\u2019 best-seller list for three years and The Sunday Times\u2019 U.K. best-seller list for nearly five. Its publication propelled Hawking to international fame that\u2019s endured to this day. He published five additional general-audience books on science, plus one memoir and four children\u2019s books. He also guest-starred on both \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation.\u201d At age 74, Stephen Hawking sits onstage during an announcement of the Breakthrough Starshot initiative with investor Yuri Milner in New York on April 12, 2016. Lucas Jackson/Reuters Stephen and Jane Hawking separated after several years of tension in 1990, which Jane said was exacerbated by her husband\u2019s newfound \u201c fame and fortune .\u201d The physicist began a relationship with Elaine Mason, one of his nurses. After his divorce from Jane Hawking, he married Mason in 1995. Advertisement Hawking and his ex-wife did not speak for several years , but they started communicating again after he and Mason got divorced in 2007. Stephen and Jane Hawking later began living around the corner from one another in Cambridge. In 2011, Hawking appeared on the Discovery Channel TV series \u201cCuriosity,\u201d in which he reflected on the origins of the universe and rejected the likelihood of both a God and an afterlife. ( He once dismissed the latter as \u201ca fairy story for people afraid of the dark.\u201d) Only in confronting the finite nature of death, he said, do we appreciate the remarkable beauty of life in the present. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Balancing Patient Freedom With Safety And Well Being I have always hated involuntary psychiatric treatment. It is demeaning to human dignity, subject to abuse, and extremely unpleasant both to experience and to recommend. But there are rare times when pressuring someone into treatment becomes the lesser evil, preferable to the risks of suicide, violence, jail or homelessness.

It is demeaning to human dignity, subject to abuse, and extremely unpleasant both to experience and to recommend. But there are rare times when pressuring someone into treatment becomes the lesser evil, preferable to the risks of suicide, violence, jail or homelessness. My first experiences in psychiatry occurred fifty years ago, at a time when 650,000 patients were warehoused in psychiatric hospitals, accurately described as 'snake pits'. I very much admired Tom Szasz for calling this out and fighting to free patients from their bondage. Some of my own earliest writings were directed against psychiatric paternalism- emphasizing instead the great value of eliciting patient preferences and of negotiating, rather than dictating, their treatment plans. And, in many years of emergency room work, my instinct was almost always on the side of taking reasonable risks- letting most people go when they insisted, rather than playing it safe by forcing them into a hospital stay. But there are exceptions- people with severe and chronic mental illness who are an ongoing, clear, and present danger to self, family, and/or the public, but who lack the insight or volition to get the help needed to reduce what is otherwise an unacceptable risk. Advertisement How do we achieve an equitable balance between the sometimes competing values of freedom and safety? Involuntary commitment to inpatient psychiatric hospitals has become very uncommon in the US because almost all psychiatric hospitals have been closed (90%, comprising 600,000 beds in the last 50 years). Completely not coincidentally, the concomitant failure to provide adequate community treatment and housing has resulted in an equivalent 600,000 people with severe mental illness being housed in jails or left homeless on the street. This neglect has made the United States for many people the worst place in the world to have a severe mental illness. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/saving-normal/201512/worlds-best-and-worst-places-be-mentally-ill Forty-six states have adopted Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) statutes in an attempt both to improve the lives of the severely ill and also to reduce risk among those who are at highest risk if their severe mental illness goes untreated. Court-ordered treatment is applied only rarely and only for people who meet strict legal criteria of risk and lack of insight. I write about this issue now in response to a recent paper by Barnes and Badre: 'Is the Evidence Strong Enough to Warrant Long-Term Antipsychotic Use in Compulsory Outpatient Treatment?' http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ps.201500408 Advertisement These authors argue against the use of involuntary medication in AOT programs, because the existing literature is insufficient to prove longterm efficacy beyond one year. Drs Barnes and Badre have confused two non-related issues: the risk/benefit of long-term antipsychotic use with its use in short term AOT programs. The duration of court mandated outpatient treatment is generally brief. In 22 states, initial AOT orders are limited to 90 days or less; in 15 others, they are limited to 180 days or less; and even with renewals, 35 states allow orders of up to no more than one year. In the state of New York, 45% of orders are not renewed at the end of 6 months. Only 39% remain in the program for more than one year and only 25% for more than 30 months. http://bi.omh.ny.gov/aot/statistics?p=court-order-renewals Advertisement Most people in AOT convert successfully to voluntary treatment within a year. Many who were unhappy when originally ordered into outpatient care, later feel grateful once they have been helped by it. Studies show that AOT improves symptoms and functioning and reduces hospitalizations, arrests, and violence. http://dhmh.maryland.gov/bhd/Documents/Morrissey_OPC_Final_Report_%20110413(1).pdf The Barnes/Badre argument about the lack of literature supporting long term antipsychotic treatment doesn't apply to most people who are in AOT only on a short term basis. It has more relevence to the 25% or so of cases in which court mandated outpatient treatment is extended for a longer period of time. Because it is impossible to extend placebo controlled studies for indefinite periods, we will probably never have conclusive evidence on long term risks vs benefits of antipsychotic meds. But shorter term, randomized clinical trials show unequivocally that antipsychotic medicine dramatically reduces relapse rates during the first year after an episode. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/setting-the-record-straig_23_b_9243828.html Advertisement For people with a history of severe, persistent, and dangerous relapses, the real risks of antipsychotic medicine are often outweighed by the substantial benefit. Protecting individual freedom is a great social good. But protecting personal and public safety is an equally compelling social good. It is no gift to a psychotic individual to protect his freedom to refuse much needed treatment if the immediate consequence is his harming himself or others, or winding up in jail for a nuissance crime, or being left derilict and homeless. Court mandated treatment is usually short, its benefits are often long. AOT laws provide legal recognition and protection of the patient's right to refuse treatment, but stipulate that this right is not absolute. Mandated treatment is permitted for specified, usually brief, periods only when the patients judgment is severely and manifestly impaired and when his refusing treatment will lead to terrible consequences. The risks of illness must be very great and must clearly exceed the very considerable risks posed by antipsychotic meds. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Unfortunately, enforced treatment has become a polarizing issue that is often discussed in ideological terms, as if there is a universal right answer. In my experience, people who seem to differ in theory agree much more in practice when discussing the specifics of any given situation. Advertisement Eleanor Longden of Hearing Voices and I have had very different experiences of psychiatry, but agree completely on a common sense approach that places the highest value on free decision making, except in the very most extreme circumstances when such freedom may lead to disaster. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/when-is-it-justified-to-f_b_4038218.html Allen Frances is a professor emeritus at Duke University and was the chairman of the DSM-IV task force.

Here's How To Watch The Draconid Meteor Shower A new moon will create near-ideal viewing conditions on Oct. 8 and 9. By Kim Bellware Reporter, HuffPost Oct 6, 2015, 12:16 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT AFP via Getty Images The Draconid meteor shower is set to make its annual October appearance later this week, peaking on the evenings of Oct. 8 and 9 starting at nightfall. A new moon on Oct. 13 will create near-ideal viewing conditions. The Draconids, once called Giacobinids, are meteors that take their name from the northern constellation Draco the Dragon. From the perspective of someone on earth, the meteors appear to originate from a point near the dragon's head , according to science blog EarthSky. Advertisement Stargazers in the Northern Hemisphere are expected to have the best view, since Draco is located so far up in the northern sky. The best places to view the Draconids will be in areas like the northern United States, Canada, Europe and northern Asia. The comet that causes the Draconids -- formally known as periodic comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner -- orbits the sun once approximately every six and a half years. The meteor shower occurs when the earth collides with bits of of dust and debris in the comets' wake, according to NASA. Though the comet typically produces only a few meteors per hour, European observers saw roughly 600 meteors per hour in 2011 -- even with a bright moon. Advertisement EarthSky recommends getting away from glowing city lights to get the best view (rural skywatchers are just fine). And if you miss the Draconids, don't fret: A second meteor shower, the Orionids, is expected to debut before dawn on Oct. 22.

A Gunshot Filmed At 73,000 Frames Per Second Is Mesmerizing Slowest gun in the West. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 18, 2015, 01:55 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT What's faster than a speeding bullet? Mythbusters' Phantom v2010 camera , which has the power to seemingly slow down time, stretching out this video of a pistol firing from blink-and-you'll-miss-it to an incredible 10-second expanse. \"I seriously had no idea it would be that lovely,\" Mythbusters co-host Adam Savage says in the video, reflecting on the incredible intricacy of the explosion. Advertisement \"The artifacts that you start to be able to see! Mushroom clouds, and little rivulets of gasses, and fire forming on flame fronts, and pressure waves and stuff I'm not sure many people in the world have even looked at,\" he adds, pausing, momentarily awestruck. \"It's just really cool.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

According to Savage, the gun fired by co-host Jamie Hyneman has a muzzle velocity of 1,200 feet per second, while the camera captured it at a rate of 73,000 frames per second. Advertisement Mythbusters' ultra high-speed camera maxes out at 1 million frames per second, notes Nerdist , at which point a single second of video (1 million frames) would take 9.25 hours to watch. For perspective, an iPhone 6 in \"slo-mo\" mode is capable of shooting at 240 frames per second .
