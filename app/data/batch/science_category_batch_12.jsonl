Scientists To Study Mysterious Interstellar Asteroid For Signs Of Alien Technology Is the elongated asteroid 'Oumuamua actually some kind of probe? By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Dec 12, 2017, 05:05 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Earlier this autumn, an asteroid named \u2019Oumuamua captured the attention of the scientific world when it was confirmed as the first known object from outside the solar system. Now, Breakthrough Listen wants to see if it\u2019s the first sign of life beyond our planet. On Wednesday, the $100 million project to detect potential evidence of extraterrestrials plans to use the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia to observe the asteroid across four radio bands for 10 hours. Advertisement \u201c Most likely it is of natural origin , but because it is so peculiar, we would like to check if it has any sign of artificial origin, such as radio emissions,\u201d Avi Loeb, professor of astronomy at Harvard University and an adviser to Breakthrough Listen, told The Guardian. \u201cIf we do detect a signal that appears artificial in origin, we\u2019ll know immediately.\u201d According to a news release, it will take less than a minute to detect a transmitter with the power of a cellphone. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be sensational in any way , and we are very realistic about the chances this is artificial,\u201d Yuri Milner, the Silicon Valley billionaire behind the Breakthrough Initiatives, told Scientific American. \u201cBut because this is a unique situation, we think mankind can afford 10 hours of observing time using the best equipment on the planet to check a low-probability hypothesis.\u201d Advertisement \u2019Oumuamua\u2019s unusual cigar shape \u2015 10 times longer than it is wide \u2015 was also \u201cthe most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft since this would minimize friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust,\u201d the organization said. However, \u201ca natural origin is more likely.\u201d Although it\u2019s highly unlikely (to say the least) that we\u2019ll hear anything, we\u2019d be crazy not to have a go. It\u2019s not everyday that we get access to a visitor from interstellar space. https://t.co/WVOqXYN0yo \u2014 Brian Cox (@ProfBrianCox) December 12, 2017 Originally classified as a comet, \u2019Oumuamua showed no comet-like activity after passing the sun, which caused astronomers to reclassify it as an \u201cinterstellar asteroid.\u201d Advertisement \u201c We also found that it had a reddish color , similar to objects in the outer solar system, and confirmed that it is completely inert, without the faintest hint of dust around it,\u201d Karen Meech of the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii said in a NASA news release. Meech, who is the leader of the team that discovered \u2019Oumuamua, told The New York Times last month that \u201c our observations are entirely consistent with it being a natural object .\u201d NASA also noted: \u201cPreliminary orbital calculations suggest that the object came from the approximate direction of the bright star Vega, in the northern constellation of Lyra. However, it took so long for the interstellar object to make the journey \u2015 even at the speed of about 59,000 miles per hour (26.4 kilometers per second) \u2015 that Vega was not near that position when the asteroid was there about 300,000 years ago.\u201d The object, which passed Earth at roughly 85 times the distance of the moon, will pass Jupiter next year and Saturn the following year before leaving the solar system and heading toward the constellation Pegasus. \u2019Oumuamua is a Hawaiian word meaning \u201ca messenger from afar arriving first.\u201d Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Elusive Dwarf Galaxy Found Orbiting Our Milky Way It's the fourth largest circling our Milky Way, astronomers say. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 16, 2016, 03:38 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Our Milky Way galaxy, as seen from the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean. There are about four dozen galaxies that we know of which circle it. Loop Images via Getty Images We have a newfound galactic neighbor. Astronomers say they've recently discovered an elusive dwarf galaxy orbiting our own Milky Way. There are about four dozen galaxies that we know of circling our own, New Scientist reported . Our newly named neighbor, Crater 2, is the fourth largest, according to a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on Wednesday. (The biggest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way is the Large Magellanic Cloud , nearly 200,000 light years away .) Advertisement Crater 2 sits some 400,000 light years away, said paper co-author Dr. Vasily Belokurov, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy. \"This is indeed a very rare discovery,\" Belokurov told The Huffington Post. \"A galaxy like Crater 2 is a sort of invisible object.\" \u201cIt seems to be aligned with a handful of other astronomically nearby objects, which may be teaching us how our group of galaxies formed.\u201d Advertisement Researchers at Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Astronomy discovered the dwarf galaxy in January when they used a computer algorithm to pinpoint where there might be a significant clustering of stars in images taken of space beyond our Milky Way. They identified a never-before-seen cluster of stars -- and concluded that this was evidence of a dwarf galaxy. Analysis of the data revealed that Crater 2 is roughly the same age as the universe, and its angular size is at least twice that of our own moon. Advertisement An artist's illustration of what Crater 2 would look like if it was a few thousand times more luminous than actually it is. The Moon is shown to scale for comparison. V. Belokurov, S. Koposov & G. Torrealba, IoA Cambridge, VST ATLAS, Simon C. Smith \"We have found many similar objects in the last 10 years, but never such a large beast,\" Belokurov said. \"It is orders of magnitude less luminous compared to most objects of similar size. It is extremely diffuse. We believe it was born that fluffy. But why, we do not yet know.\" Dr. Jay Pasachoff, an astronomer at Williams College in Massachusetts, who was not involved in the new discovery, said that to find such a faint and diffuse galaxy is a nice piece of research. Advertisement \"It is always fun to discover a nearby neighbor about which we didn't know before, and the dwarf galaxy Crater 2 falls into that category,\" said the co-author of The Cosmos . \"It seems to be aligned with a handful of other astronomically nearby objects, which may be teaching us how our group of galaxies formed.\" The Large Magellanic Cloud and other orbiting galaxies are seen at the Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile. V. Belokurov, S. Koposov (IoA, Cambridge). Photo: Y. Beletsky (Carnegie Observatories) The same research team discovered a treasure trove of nine new dwarf galaxies orbiting our Milky Way last year. Advertisement At the time, Dr. Sergey Koposov of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Astronomy, who led that previous study, said in a statement , \"The discovery of so many satellites in such a small area of the sky was completely unexpected ... I could not believe my eyes.\" Until 10 years ago, only a dozen dwarf satellite galaxies had been identified around the Milky Way. But Belokurov said that he and his colleagues have since found several tens more. \"In the last two years alone, the number of known Milky Way satellite galaxies has doubled, largely thanks to the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco 4 meter telescope in Chile,\" Dr. Evan Kirby, assistant professor at Caltech Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics , who was not involved in the research, told HuffPost. Advertisement \"These galaxies are intense concentrations of dark matter,\" he added. \"If there's a place in the universe where we can look to learn about dark matter, it's dwarf galaxies. How is it distributed? What is it made of? Future observations, especially spectroscopy, will help answer those questions.\" Dwarf galaxies are the most numerous type of galaxy in the universe. \"While we cannot say for sure this particular dwarf is the oldest in the universe, dwarf galaxies in general are,\" Belokurov said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Study Predicts 200 Feet Of Sea Level Rise If All Fossil Fuels Are Burned \"This is humanity as a geologic force.\" By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sep 13, 2015, 04:10 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT \"To be blunt: If we burn it all, we melt it all.\" So says Ricarda Winkelmann , the lead author of a new paper that paints a dire picture of our planet should we continue to extract and burn the world's coal, oil and natural gas reserves. Published Friday in the journal Science Advances, the study forecasts sea levels rising more than 200 feet should all fossil fuels be used by humanity. In such a scenario, the entire ice sheet covering Antarctica, as well as every bit of land ice on Earth, would melt. Advertisement Winkelmann spoke to The New York Times on Friday about her team's research, which found the rate of melting could occur far more quickly than scientists had expected. Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science and co-author of the paper, told NPR the planet could see 2 or 3 feet of sea level rise this century if current trends continue. But then the rates will start to increase exponentially, and within 1,000 years, \"we'll have something like 100 feet of sea level rise ... which means basically abandoning most of the major cities of the world.\" The researchers found that as the rest of the world's ice continued to melt, sea levels would be pushed upwards nearly 200 feet in total. Advertisement The Times noted many of the world's metropolises would lie underwater should this degree of sea level rise occur. Sydney, Rome, Tokyo, New York, Amsterdam, Beijing, Berlin and Paris would all be at risk, as well as wide swaths of Europe, Asia and the East Coast of the United States. \u201cThis is humanity as a geologic force,\u201d Caldeira told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019re not a subtle influence on the climate system -- we are really hitting it with a hammer.\u201d The new research comes just a few months ahead of the highly anticipated Paris climate summit , where hundreds of world leaders and scientists are expected to hash out sweeping new goals to tackle the growing scourge of climate change. Talk has already turned severe ahead of the meeting, with many countries facing the brunt of rising seas demanding more than the empty promises of past meetings. Advertisement The world has set a slew of troubling records over the past year. July was the hottest month the planet's seen since record keeping began and it's quite likely 2015 will be the warmest year on record. A January study found 82 percent of the world's known fossil fuel reserves would need to stay in the ground should society hope to stay underneath the 2 degree Celsius threshold of warming scientists have agreed to. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Why Silence Is So Good For Your Brain In a loud and distracting world, finding pockets of stillness can benefit your brain and body. Here are four science-backed reasons why. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 5, 2016, 07:00 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Making time for silence can make you feel less stressed, more focused and more creative, according to science. LM Photo via Getty Images We live in a loud and distracting world, where silence is increasingly difficult to come by \u2015 and that may be negatively affecting our health. In fact, a 2011 World Health Organization report called noise pollution a \u201cmodern plague,\u201d concluding that \u201cthere is overwhelming evidence that exposure to environmental noise has adverse effects on the health of the population.\u201d Advertisement We\u2019re constantly filling our ears with music, TV and radio news, podcasts and, of course, the multitude of sounds that we create nonstop in our own heads. Think about it: How many moments each day do you spend in total silence? The answer is probably very few. As our internal and external environments become louder and louder, more people are beginning to seek out silence, whether through a practice of sitting quietly for 10 minutes every morning or heading off to a 10-day silent retreat. Inspired to go find some peace and quiet? Here are four science-backed ways that silence is good for your brain \u2015 and how making time for it can make you feel less stressed, more focused and more creative. Advertisement 1. Silence relieves stress and tension. Florence Nightingale, the 19th century British nurse and social activist, once wrote that \u201cUnnecessary noise is the most cruel absence of care that can be inflicted on sick or well.\u201d Nightingale argued that needless sounds could cause distress, sleep loss and alarm for recovering patients. It turns out that noise pollution has been found to lead to high blood pressure and heart attacks, as well as impairing hearing and overall health. Loud noises raise stress levels by activating the brain\u2019s amygdala and causing the release of the stress hormone cortisol, according to research. An unpublished 2004 paper by environmental psychologist Dr. Craig Zimring suggests that higher noise levels in neonatal intensive care units led to elevated blood pressure, increased heart rates and disrupted patient sleep patterns. Advertisement Just as too much noise can cause stress and tension, research has found that silence has the opposite effect, releasing tension in the brain and body. A 2006 study published in the journal Heart found two minutes of silence to be more relaxing than listening to \u201crelaxing\u201d music, based on changes in blood pressure and blood circulation in the brain. 2. Silence replenishes our mental resources. In our everyday lives, sensory input is being thrown at us from every angle. When we can finally get away from these sonic disruptions, our brains\u2019 attention centers have the opportunity to restore themselves. Advertisement The ceaseless attentional demands of modern life put a significant burden on the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is involved in high-order thinking, decision-making and problem-solving. As a result, our attentional resources become drained. When those attention resources are depleted, we become distracted and mentally fatigued, and may struggle to focus, solve problems and come up with new ideas. But according to attention restoration theory , the brain can restore its finite cognitive resources when we\u2019re in environments with lower levels of sensory input than usual. In silence \u2015 for instance, the quiet stillness you find when walking alone in nature \u2015 the brain can let down its sensory guard, so to speak. Advertisement 3. In silence, we can tap into the brain\u2019s default mode network. The default mode network of the brain is activated when we engage in what scientists refer to as \u201cself-generated cognition,\u201d such as daydreaming, meditating, fantasizing about the future or just letting our minds wander. When the brain is idle and disengaged from external stimuli, we can finally tap into our inner stream of thoughts, emotions, memories and ideas. Engaging this network helps us to make meaning out of our experiences, empathize with others, be more creative and reflect on our own mental and emotional states. In order to do this, it\u2019s necessary to break away from the distractions that keep us lingering on the shallow surfaces of the mind. Silence is one way of getting there. Advertisement Default mode activity helps us think deeply and creatively. As Herman Melville once wrote, \u201cAll profound things and emotions of things are preceded and attended by silence.\u201d 4. Getting quiet can regenerate brain cells. Silence can quite literally grow the brain. A 2013 study on mice , published in the journal Brain, Structure, and Function, involved comparing the effects of ambient noise, white noise, pup calls and silence on the rodents\u2019 brains. Although the researchers intended to use silence as a control in the study, they found that two hours of silence daily led to the development of new cells in the hippocampus, a key brain region associated with learning, memory and emotion. While preliminary, the findings suggested that silence could be therapeutic for conditions like depression and Alzheimer\u2019s, which are associated with decreased rates of neuron regeneration in the hippocampus.

I Gave Up Coffee For A Week. Here's Why I Won't Be Going Back. I'm going to approach coffee like I do desserts -- every once in a while. \ud83c\udf70 \u2615 \ufe0f By Brynn Mannino Senior Programming Manager, Partnerships Jan 23, 2016, 08:51 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Lee-or Atsmon Fruin This story is part of a 10-piece series for which HuffPost staffers agreed to experiment with improving their health and decreasing their stress on the job. It\u2019s also part of our month-long \u201c Work Well \u201d initiative focusing on thriving in the workplace . Some people are extremely sensitive to coffee, and I've always felt like I'm one of them. I was in college when I tried coffee for the first time, after which I phoned my mom convinced I was having an anxiety attack. I didn\u2019t suspect the caffeine at all. I just thought I was losing it. Clearly, it was my first rodeo. Advertisement Eventually I got used to the drink's stimulating effect and even came to enjoy my daily cup, not to mention the digestive help and mild appetite suppression it seemed to bring. Add to that the piles and piles and piles of research touting how great the brown stuff is for you, and it's safe to say I wanted coffee and me to work. I started off drinking maybe a tiny, weak French-pressed cup each day. More recently I'd grab a 20-ounce Starbucks on my way to work in the morning. Around that time, I noticed that I wasn't feeling like myself. I wasn't sleeping well and was tired a lot, which can happen to coffee drinkers but is usually linked to having coffee late in the day. Though I drink mine early, I suspected my extreme caffeine sensitivity might be to blame. I was also feeling more stress and anxiety, which may be linked to coffee consumption in a small number of people , though there's conflicting research on this. I never considered myself a coffee addict, but I was starting to think my a.m. caffeine lift had become too much for me. So I resolved to give up java for seven days to see if I felt better. As it turns out, coffee affects my body and mind more than I realized. Advertisement RULES No coffee for one week other than one cup on the weekend -- but only if in a relaxed environment. PREDICTIONS I knew I would miss the ritual, the pleasant smell, the familiar taste and the fact that I could work several hours straight during the first half of the day without feeling very hungry. I also figured I'd have less regular bowel movements without my morning joe. I assumed I'd have a headache for a couple days while my body adjusted, but that's a small price to pay for what I hoped would be better sleep and more regular eating patterns. And while I thought I'd feel sluggish at work on the first day of my challenge, I hoped that I'd make stronger decisions throughout the day if I felt more rested and balanced. DAILY DIARY Day 1 Not a super fun time but no serious mental, emotional or physical side effects -- although I did feel a bit lethargic as I sat at my work desk. Advertisement GIFSec.com Day 2 Successfully walked past Starbucks. It was tricky. Spylight.com Day 3 Officially uncomfortable. Bowel movements non-existent or unsatisfying for past two days. Painful headache. Advertisement Citytv Day 4 Feeling better. Early morning bowel movement -- check. Also beginning to feel very hydrated from all the supplemental decaf tea-drinking. I suspect all the fluids are keeping my appetite in check. HelloBeautiful.com Advertisement Day 5 More goodness. Beginning to see the effects of all that hydration on skin, eyes, lips. Feeling very leaned-out from all the fluids. Headaches and fogginess gone! Slept well last night. Feeling high-energy, but not anxious, which seems to be helping at work -- productive, yet calm. Day 6 Feeling super at-ease, even-keeled. Getting used to not having energy spikes from the caffeine kick, which also means no lows when that kick wears off. Brain working quickly from multiple nights of hard sleep. Noticing an impressive ability to think through email responses and tasks. Body assuming natural state that it clearly prefers. Advertisement Giphy.com Day 7 Saturday . Enjoyed my first coffee since going cold turkey. Probably shouldn't have had a large. Didn't sleep well that night, but felt OK the next day despite the lack of rest. Giphy.com Advertisement KEY TAKEAWAYS My non-scientific conclusion is that I\u2019m not someone who needs coffee. I think it\u2019s too much stimulation for me and causes some anxiety because of said stimulation, followed by a crash and fatigue. I think it creates an imbalance in mood and confuses my appetite in a way that makes me feel like I have less control over my food intake throughout the rest of the day. I'm still a fan of the digestive help coffee gives me, but really I think I conditioned my body to depend on it. My body seemed to balance itself out a few days after I stopped consuming the drink. While I felt less hyped at work, I preferred the way my brain functioned and reasoned through challenges in its natural state. Advertisement WHAT'S NEXT? I think I should stop drinking coffee, at least on a daily basis. Perhaps I should indulge in coffee the same way I do desserts -- every once in a while. It does taste and feel like a treat, after all. This approach feels right for me. But to each their own, of course. We're all wired differently.

Astronaut Tim Peake Is Ready To Run The London Marathon From Space -- And You Can Join Him The Briton will be using RunSocial, an app that'll let him interact with runners on Earth. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 15, 2016, 04:14 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Come April 24, British astronaut Tim Peake, along with approximately 38,000 other runners, will be attempting the 26.2-mile London Marathon. The only difference is, Peake will be running the race about 250 miles above everybody else -- in space. British astronaut @astro_timpeake gets set to run London Marathon from space https://t.co/mgJUlqrNCG pic.twitter.com/aqMcoYQECW \u2014 CBS News Sci Tech (@CBSSciTech) April 14, 2016 Advertisement Aiming to be the first man to run a marathon in space, Peake has been preparing for the big day for months. In an Associated Press interview published this week, the 44-year-old astronaut, who has been living on the International Space Station since December, said he\u2019s now ready for race day . \u201cIt's a great challenge that I set myself, and I'm quite glad this is happening later on in the mission,\u201d he told AP. Peake is no stranger to long distance running; in 1999, he completed the London Marathon in 3 hours 18 minutes 50 seconds. Advertisement Attempting the same distance in zero gravity, however, comes with a whole new set of difficulties. \u201c One of the biggest challenges I\u2019ll be facing is the harness system ,\u201d he told The Guardian in December. \u201cIt has a waistbelt and shoulder straps. That has to provide quite a bit of downforce to get my body on to the treadmill, so after about 40 minutes, that gets very uncomfortable.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be setting any personal bests,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve set myself a goal of anywhere between 3:30 to 4 hours.\u201d Looking for a running partner this Sunday? Why not join Tim Peake on another training run? pic.twitter.com/SVnioFU2Q5 \u2014 LondonMarathon (@LondonMarathon) April 8, 2016 Advertisement Though Peake will be the first man to run a marathon in space, he\u2019s not the first human to do so. That accolade belongs to NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, who completed the 2007 Boston Marathon while on the ISS . She ran the race in just under four and a half hours. However, as The Guardian points out, Peake\u2019s marathon experience will be quite different from that of Williams: He\u2019ll actually get to run virtually on the streets of London, and will have the opportunity to interact with his fellow competitors on Earth. Peake will be using RunSocial , an app which allows runners to watch interactive, \u201cmixed reality\u201d videos of actual courses while on the treadmill. Advertisement As he runs, he'll be able to see an avatar of himself running at a corresponding speed along the London course. He\u2019ll also see the avatars of other runners who are also using the app. Sun April 17: Join @astro_timpeake 's live training run for Digital #LondonMarathon .

How We'd Survive The Post-Apocalyptic World In 'Fallout' If we survive the radiation, then we'll need to make power, water and food. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 11, 2015, 12:41 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Could humans survive a nuclear apocalypse, like the one seen in the \"Fallout\" video game series? That's the premise of a new video (above) of the American Chemical Society on Tuesday. In a nutshell, the video concludes that we could survive, but only by living for decades in creepy fallout shelters, similar to the ones seen in the game \"Fallout 4 .\" But what happens when we need water and food to survive for the long-haul? Check out the video to decide how you'd survive a nuclear fallout -- or whether you'd prefer to stick with a zombie apocalypse, thank you very much.

Astronomers Discover Most Distant Galaxy Yet \"We are looking at the very first moments of galaxy formation.\" By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 7, 2015, 09:01 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A color composite image of the galaxy EGS8p7 from data taken with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes. I. Labbe/LeidenUniversity/NASA/ESA/JPL-Caltech A newly discovered galaxy, dubbed EGSY8p7, has set a far-flung record. The ancient galaxy is the most distant one humans have yet discovered, sitting some 13.2 billion light-years away from Earth , Space.com reports. In fact, the galaxy is so far away that astrophysicists observing it from Earth are seeing it as it was less than 600 million years after the Big Bang -- which happened some 13.8 billion years ago. Advertisement \"This is a time when we believe the first galaxies were formed and had a considerable effect on the evolution of the universe ,\" Guido Roberts-Borsani, a Ph.D. student at University College London who co-authored a paper describing the galaxy, said in a written statement. \"Finding galaxies at such an early age is rare and provides us with a unique insight into the conditions that allowed these objects to form. We are looking at the very first moments of galaxy formation.\" (Story continues below.) This illustration shows the progress made in recent years in probing early cosmic history. Hydrogen emission from EGSY8p7 may indicate it is the first known example of an early generation of young galaxies emitting unusually strong radiation. Credit: Adi Zitrin/California Institute of Technology, 2015 Astrophysicists used the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii not only to measure how far away the galaxy is located, but also to date the galaxy by detecting its Lyman-alpha emission line -- a signature of hot hydrogen gas that can reveal a galaxy's age since it's heated by the galaxy's newborn stars. Advertisement The researchers said they were surprised even to be able to detect the Lyman-alpha emission line from so far away. \"We frequently see the Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen in nearby objects as it is one of most reliable tracers of star-formation,\" Dr. Adi Zitrin, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology and lead author of the paper, said in a separate statement. \"However, as we penetrate deeper into the universe, and hence back to earlier times, the space between galaxies contains an increasing number of dark clouds of hydrogen which absorb this signal.\" The ancient galaxy may shed new light on how the universe evolved in its past. The paper is slated to be published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters . When astronomers look into the depths of space to spot galaxies, they are in fact looking back in time. But how is that possible? Check out the \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" episode below to find out.

Marcia Dunn Nov 30, 2021, 05:31 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 NASA called off a spacewalk Tuesday because of menacing space junk that could puncture an astronaut\u2019s suit or damage the International Space Station. Two U.S. astronauts were set to replace a bad antenna outside of the space station. But late Monday night, Mission Control learned that a piece of orbiting debris might come dangerously close. There wasn\u2019t enough time to assess the threat so station managers delayed the spacewalk until Thursday. Advertisement It\u2019s the first time a spacewalk has been canceled because of threat from space junk. The space station and its crew of seven have been at increased risk from space junk since Russia destroyed a satellite in a missile test two weeks ago. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the object of concern was part of the Russian satellite wreckage. During a news conference Monday, NASA officials said the Nov. 15 missile test resulted in at least 1,700 satellite pieces big enough to track, and thousands more too small to be observed from the ground but still able to pierce a spacewalker\u2019s suit. NASA officials said astronauts Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron faced a 7 percent greater risk of a spacewalk puncture because of the Russian-generated debris. But they said it was still within acceptable limits based on previous experience.

Scientists Cut Uncertainty of the Size of the Universe in Half The study used supernovae within about 400 million light years of Earth, which is a relatively small fraction of the size of the visible universe, but it is hoped that future studies will significantly improve our measurements of even more distant supernovae.

The night sky has captivated people for as long as we have told stories. For millennia, mankind has sat in the dark and taken in the glorious spectacle of the stars and planets as they have marched across the sky. While we now know that space goes on essentially forever, it's important to remember that star gazing is inherently a two-dimensional endeavor. To all intents and purposes, the sky is like a giant television screen. We can precisely know the position of celestial objects on the tapestry of the heavens, but knowing how far away these objects are is much harder. In our common experience, we can determine the distance of objects using our binocular vision inherited from our tree-living ancestors, but even using our best space-based telescopes and most sophisticated techniques, this approach works for objects that are within a ten or twenty thousand light years. While impressive, that distance is just peanuts to space. For distances greater than that, it is necessary to compare the absolute and observed brightness of well understood objects and to use the difference to determine the object's distance. Essentially, this approach is the same as when sailors use the apparent brightness of a known lighthouse to estimate how far away it is. Advertisement In astronomy, finding an object of known brightness is very difficult. After all, there are examples of both bright and dim stars and galaxies. Luckily there is one astronomical phenomenon for which it is possible to work out its absolute brightness. This object is called a supernova. Supernovae are the death throws of a star in the last minutes of its life. The star explodes with such violence that we can see the flash across the vast universe. The special class called a Type Ia supernova is thought to occur in binary star systems, when a white dwarf siphons off mass from its companion. This reproducible mechanism leads to a well determined brightness and has led scientists to term Type Ia supernovae as \"standard candles.\" While Type Ia supernovae have been considered the gold standard for distant sources of light, they have a small residual variability that has limited our knowledge of the size of the universe. A recent paper in Science describes the result of a study using Type Ia supernovae in young, star-forming, environments. Because of the environment in which these supernovae occur, astronomers have determined their intrinsic brightness (and therefore distance) with a precision of under four percent, which is about twice as good as earlier measurements. Advertisement The study used supernovae within about 400 million light years of Earth, which is a relatively small fraction of the size of the visible universe, but it is hoped that future studies will significantly improve our measurements of even more distant supernovae.

Scientists May Have Isolated The Secret To Staying Healthy Past Age 100 A new study identifies a vital trait to living for (at least) a century. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Aug 6, 2015, 04:09 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Nobutoshi Kurisu via Getty Images What's the secret of people who live vibrant, healthy lives well beyond the age of 100? Low levels of inflammation -- the long-term overactivation of the immune response -- may be the answer, suggests a new study of centenarians from researchers in England and Japan. People with lower markers of chronic inflammation also tend to be less likely to develop diseases, meaning suppressing inflammation could be the No. 1 key to not only living longer but to staying healthy longer. \"Centenarians and supercentenarians are different -- put simply, they age slower,\" Dr. Thomas von Zglinicki, a cellular gerontologist at Newcastle University and the study's lead author, said in a written statement. \"They can ward off diseases for much longer than the general population.\" Advertisement Dr. Cheri Gostic, a geriatric specialist at Stony Brook University who has studied the effects of physical activity on inflammation, said the findings, which were published online last week in the journal EBioMedicine , weren't entirely surprising. \"Research has demonstrated that chronic systemic inflammation is a key factor in the development of many common chronic diseases, including ... heart attacks, peripheral vascular disease and most strokes,\" Gostic told The Huffington Post. \"Old age does not cause death; disease does. If one can minimize inflammation in the body and reduce the risk or progression of disease, then it makes sense that individuals have a better chance to live longer.\" In addition to low levels of inflammation, healthy centenarians and supercentenarians (people over 110 years old) also had longer telomeres, which are the caps on the end of DNA strands that protect the chromosomes from aging and poor health. Advertisement Telomere length has generally been thought to be the strongest predictor of how healthy someone will be in their old age. However, the researchers found that once a person reaches 100, inflammation levels rather than telomere length better predict successful aging and cognitive ability. The Inflammation Factor For the study, the researchers analyzed data from 1,500 adults between the ages of 50 and 115 years old, including 684centenarians or supercentenarians and 167 children of centenarians. They measured for various health markers thought to contribute to aging, including metabolism, blood cell count, telomere length, inflammation, and liver and kidney function. Here are some of the key findings: Even when they were well into their 80s and beyond, the children of centenarians (who are likely to become centenarians themselves) maintained telomeres more typical of a 60-year-old. Centenarians with the lowest levels of markers for chronic inflammation were able to maintain good cognition and independence for the longest periods of time. Those with less inflammation also experienced the greatest longevity. Inflammation was a stronger predictor of cognitive capacity in semi-supercentenarians (those who lived to be 105) than gender or biological age. Researchers also found that the children of centenarians tended to have lower markers of chronic inflammation, meaning your chances of living a long, healthy life are to some extent genetic. \"This indicates that someone who will (probably) become a centenarian is able to keep inflammation down for longer,\" von Zglinicki told HuffPost. Scientists have long known that inflammation plays some role in disease and aging, and a study on mice found that inflammation can even accelerate the aging process . The new findings provide further evidence that chronic inflammation may be the most important factor determining how quickly or slowly we age. Advertisement Making It To 100 Reaching a better scientific understanding of how centenarians achieve such extreme longevity -- and how inflammation factors into the aging process -- may help the rest of us to live longer and healthier. Hoping to join the 100 club? Adopting an anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle is a good place to start. Eating a diet of whole foods , exercising and cultivating positive emotions -- not to mention avoiding excessive consumption of sugar and processed foods , stress and sleep deprivation -- can keep chronic inflammation at bay. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Aliens Might Weigh As Much As Polar Bears And Be Taller Than The Tallest Man Who Ever Lived Aliens Might Be Way Bigger Than We Ever Imagined By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Apr 9, 2015, 12:43 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT One of the coolest things about the burn this year was that I got to camp with family and awesome friends. I especially enjoyed watching my son, Seth, ham it up in the alien costume I made for him. We got photos at Center Camp and in front of the many spaceship art installations placed around the Playa. He would interact with everyone, give high-fives and dance. One guy at Center Camp just grabbed him and stared doing acro-yoga with him. He ended up in a perfect flight pose. I enjoyed watching those who saw him get a little freaked out, but wind up with huge smiles. That's what it's all about, right? No one really knows whether we're alone or if the universe is brimming with brainy extraterrestrials. But that hasn't stopped scientists from trying to figure out what form intelligent aliens might take. And as University of Barcelona cosmologist Dr. Fergus Simpson argues in a new paper, most intelligent alien species would likely exceed 300 kilograms (661 pounds)--with the median body mass \"similar to that of a polar bear.\" Advertisement If such a being had human proportions, Simpson told The Huffington Post in an email, it would be taller than Robert Wadlow , who at 8 feet, 11 inches is believed to have been the tallest human who ever lived. (Story continues below photo.) Robert Wadlow (1918-1940), the tallest man who ever lived. Simpson's paper, which is posted on the online research repository arXiv.org, is chockablock with formidable-looking mathematical equations . But as he explained in the email, his starting point was to consider the relationship between the number of individuals in a population on Earth and the body mass of those individuals: \"Ants easily outnumber us because they are small. Our larger bodies require a much greater energy supply from the local resources, so it would be impossible for us to match the ant population. Now apply this concept to intelligent life across the universe. On average, we should expect physically larger species to have fewer individuals than the smaller species. And, just like with countries, we should expect to be in one of the bigger populations. In other words, we are much more likely to find ourselves to be the ants among intelligent species.\" Or, as Newsweek explained Simpson's argument, there are probably more planets with relatively small animals than planets with relatively large animals. It makes sense to assume that Earth is in the former category, so we can assume that humans are probably among the smaller intelligent beings . What do other scientists make of Simpson's paper? \u201cI think the average size calculation is reasonable,\u201d Dr. Duncan Forgan, an astrobiologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who wasn't involved in the research, told Newsweek. But to Dr. Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., the argument is suspect. Advertisement \"There is an assumption here that intelligence can come in all (reasonable) sizes, and does so with more or less equal likelihood,\" Shostak told The Huffington Post in an email. \"That may be true, but on Earth bigger has not always been better, at least in the brains department. Dolphins have higher IQs than whales, and crows are smarter than eagles. Octopuses are cleverer than giant squids, and obviously we\u2019re smarter than polar bears.\" Ultimately, Shostak said, we can\u2019t know whether \"little green men are actually big green men\" before we actually make contact. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN and MARCIA DUNN \u2014 Associated Press Jul 11, 2021, 09:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Swashbuckling entrepreneur Richard Branson hurtled into space aboard his own winged rocket ship Sunday in his boldest adventure yet, beating out fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos. The nearly 71-year-old Branson and five crewmates from his Virgin Galactic space tourism company reached an altitude of about 53 miles (88 kilometers) over the New Mexico desert \u2014 enough to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth \u2014 and then safely glided home to a runway landing. Advertisement \u201cSeventeen years of hard work to get us this far,\u201d a jubilant Branson said as he congratulated his team on the trip back aboard the sleek white space plane, named Unity. The brief, up-and-down flight was intended as a confidence-boosting plug for Virgin Galactic, which plans to start taking paying customers on joyrides next year. Richard Branson(L) receives some cards from children as he walks out from Spaceport America, near Truth and Consequences, New Mexico on July 11, 2021 before travel to the cosmos. - He's always dreamed of it, and in 2004 founded his own company to make it happen. On July 11, 2021, billionaire Richard Branson will take off from a base in New Mexico aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel bound for the edge of space. The Briton is hoping to finally get the nascent space tourism industry off the ground -- but also go one up on Jeff Bezos by winning the race to be the first person to cross the final frontier in a ship built by their own company.The Amazon founder's great rival, SpaceX boss Elon Musk, announced on Twitter he'd be there to witness it.

FALLON via Getty Images Advertisement Branson became the first person to blast off in his own spaceship, beating Bezos by nine days. He also became only the second septuagenarian to depart for space. (John Glenn flew on the shuttle at age 77 in 1998.) With about 500 people watching, including Branson\u2019s wife, children and grandchildren, a twin-fuselage aircraft with his space plane attached underneath took off in the first stage of the flight. The space plane then detached from the mother ship at an altitude of about 8 1/2 miles (13 kilometers) and fired its engine, reaching more than Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound, as it pierced the edge of space. The rocket plane\u2019s portion of the flight took just 15 minutes.

The crowd cheered and yelled as it touched down on the runway. Some spectators jumped into the air. Others embraced and shared hugs. \u201cThat was an amazing accomplishment,\u201d former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, a one-time commander of the International Space Station, said from the sidelines. \u201cI\u2019m just so delighted at what this open door is going to lead to now. It\u2019s a great moment.\u201d Virgin Galactic conducted three previous test flights into space with crews of just two or three. The flamboyant, London-born founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways wasn\u2019t supposed to fly until later this summer. But he assigned himself to an earlier flight after Bezos announced plans to ride his own rocket into space from Texas on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Branson, who has kite-surfed the English Channel and attempted to circle the world in a hot-air balloon, denied he was trying to beat Bezos. Before climbing aboard, Branson signed the astronaut log book and wisecracked: \u201cThe name\u2019s Branson. Sir Richard Branson. Astronaut Double-oh one. License to thrill.\u201d One of Branson\u2019s chief rivals in the space-tourism race among the world\u2019s richest men, SpaceX\u2019s Elon Musk, arrived in New Mexico to witness the flight, wishing Branson via Twitter, \u201cGodspeed!\u201d Bezos likewise sent his wishes for a safe and successful flight, though he also took to Twitter to enumerate the ways in which be believes his company\u2019s rides will be better. Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin company intends to send tourists past the so-called Karman line 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth, which is is recognized by international aviation and aerospace federations as the threshold of space. But NASA, the Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and some astrophysicists consider the boundary between the atmosphere and space to begin 50 miles (80 kilometers) up. The risks to Branson and his crew were underscored in 2007, when a rocket motor test in California\u2019s Mojave Desert left three workers dead, and in 2014, when a Virgin Galactic rocket plane broke apart during a test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring the other. Ever the showman, Branson insisted on a global livestream of the Sunday morning flight and invited celebrities and former space station astronauts to the company\u2019s Spaceport America base in New Mexico. R&B singer Khalid performed his new single \u201cNew Normal\u201d \u2014 a nod to the dawning of space tourism \u2014 while CBS \u201cLate Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert served as the event\u2019s master of ceremonies. Virgin Galactic already has more than 600 reservations from would-be space tourists, with tickets initially costing $250,000 apiece. Blue Origin is waiting for Bezos\u2019 flight before announcing its ticket prices. Kerianne Flynn, who signed up in 2011 to fly with Virgin Galactic, had butterflies ahead of the launch Sunday. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be nothing like going up there and looking back down on the Earth, which is what I think I\u2019m most excited about,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cHopefully the next generations will be able to explore what\u2019s up there,\u201d she said. Musk\u2019s SpaceX, which is already launching astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA and is building moon and Mars ships, is also competing for space tourism dollars. But its capsules will do more than make brief, up-and-down forays; they will go into orbit around the Earth, with seats costing well into the millions. Its first private flight is set for September. Musk himself has not committed to going into space anytime soon. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new horizon out there, new opportunities, new destinations,\u201d said former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson, who commanded the last shuttle flight 10 years ago. He now works for Boeing, which is test-flying its own space capsule. \u201cThis is really sort of like the advent of commercial air travel, only 100 years later,\u201d Ferguson added. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot waiting in the wings.\u201d ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Scientists Are Homing In On The Secrets Of Limb Regeneration A new study found a key genetic element shared by animals with regenerative abilities. By Landess Kearns Senior Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Jun 30, 2016, 11:39 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Limb regeneration may seem like a science-fiction super power reserved for lizards and starfish, but a new study is helping scientists make more sense of the strange ability. In research published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, scientists from Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory and the University of Maine found that three evolutionary distant species have important similarities in their microRNA -- small RNA molecules that regulate elements of gene expression -- which may be vital to their regenerative abilities. The researchers said they hope this new information will fuel future studies on limb regeneration and, perhaps, one day be applied to humans. Advertisement For the study, researchers compared the genetic makeup of three species with known regenerative capabilities: two fish -- zebrafish and bichir -- and axolotl salamanders, pictured above. The scientists amputated the regenerative limbs of the animals. Then, they took samples at the amputation sites and conducted RNA sequencing. Advertisement The study found that the defining feature of animals with regenerative capabilities is the formation of a type of tissue called blastema , a highly proliferative tissue with the ability to form organs and appendages. The researchers noted that there are fundamental differences in tissue composition and complexity among the animals observed. Still, they found that the samples from each species shared certain microRNAs that may be involved in blastema formation. \"Our study suggests that natural cellular reprogramming of differentiated cells during regeneration is guided by a core group of shared, differentially controlled\" microRNAs, the scientists wrote. Advertisement Though these three species diverged in evolution some 420 million years ago, the scientists said they believe comparative studies like this one will be key in revealing the secrets of limb regeneration, even for humans . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Tom Murphy Oct 17, 2021, 11:28 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING The first new Alzheimer\u2019s treatment in more than 20 years was hailed as a breakthrough when regulators approved it more than four months ago, but its rollout has been slowed by questions about its price and how well it works. Several major medical centers remain undecided on whether to use Biogen\u2019s Aduhelm, which is recommended for early stages of the disease. Big names like the Cleveland Clinic and Mass General Brigham in Boston say they\u2019ll pass on it for now. Advertisement One neurology practice has even banned the company\u2019s sales reps from its offices, citing concerns about the drug and its price, which can climb past $50,000 annually. Many doctors say they need to learn more about how Aduhelm works and what will be covered before they decide whether to offer it. That might take several months to sort out. Even then, questions may linger. \u201cThe drug won\u2019t be for everybody, even with access,\u201d said Salim Syed, an analyst who covers Biogen for Mizuho Securities USA. Advertisement Syed estimates that only around one-tenth of the people diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s may wind up taking Aduhelm chronically, especially if regulators approve similar treatments from Biogen\u2019s competitors. Biogen, which reports third-quarter financial results Wednesday, is not saying how many people have received the drug since it was approved on June 7. A company executive said last month that Biogen was aware of about 50 sites infusing Aduhelm, far fewer than the 900 the company had said it expected to be ready shortly after regulators approved the drug. Aduhelm is the first in a line of new drugs that promise to do what no other Alzheimer\u2019s treatment has managed: slow the progress of the fatal brain-destroying disease instead of just managing its symptoms. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s like a breath of fresh air,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Salloway, a Rhode Island neurologist and Biogen consultant who is prescribing the drug. People with Alzheimer\u2019s \u201cknow what\u2019s coming, and they want to do whatever they can to stay in the milder stage.\u201d The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Aduhelm despite objections from its own independent advisers, several of whom resigned. The agency later said the drug was appropriate for patients with mild symptoms or early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s. Aduhelm clears brain plaque thought to play a role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and regulators made the call based on study results showing the drug seemed likely to benefit patients. Advertisement Biogen, which developed Aduhelm with Japan\u2019s Eisai Co., had halted two studies on the drug due to disappointing results. It later said further analysis showed the treatment was effective at higher doses. The FDA is requiring Biogen to conduct a follow-up study. The research Biogen submitted so far doesn\u2019t give doctors as much insight as they would normally have into a drug, said Dr. Brendan Kelley, a neurologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Its experts are still reviewing Aduhelm. \u201cBiogen went to the FDA with preliminary data, so it makes it really challenging to know how to navigate,\u201d he said. More complete research would give doctors a better idea for how the drug will work in a broader patient population, Kelley said.

The U.S. FDA approved Biogen's Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm. Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images via Getty Images Cost is another concern. Biogen\u2019s pricing for Aduhelm is \u201cirresponsible and unconscionable,\u201d according to signs posted on office doors for The Neurology Center, a Washington, D.C.-area practice. The signs also refer to Aduhelm as a medication \u201cof dubious effectiveness\u201d and tell Biogen sales reps they are no longer welcomed in the center\u2019s offices. \u201cAs physicians we feel compelled to speak out and protest BIOGEN\u2019s actions,\u201d one of the signs reads. Neurology Center CEO Wendy Van Fossen said the signs went up in July, but she declined to elaborate on why they were posted. Advertisement A Biogen spokeswoman said in an email that it was disappointing that some centers are denying access to the drug. As for Aduhelm\u2019s effectiveness, company data shows that plaque removal \u201cis reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit,\u201d said Biogen Chief Medical Officer Dr. Maha Radhakrishnan. She said regulators reviewed data from more than 3,000 patients, counting two late-stage studies and earlier research. Doctors also are worried about whether patients taking Aduhelm will be able to get the regular brain scans needed to monitor their progress on the drug. Advertisement Issues with care access weren\u2019t explored in the clinical research, which also involved patients who were generally younger and healthier than those in the broader population, noted Dr. Zaldy Tan, director of the Cedars-Sinai memory and aging program. The Los Angeles health system is still evaluating Aduhelm. Its committee of experts is considering things like which doctors will prescribe the drug and how to ensure patients are monitored for problems like dizziness or headaches develop. Bleeding in the brain is another potential side effect. \u201cSafety and access are real issues that need to be prioritized,\u201d Tan said. Aduhelm also requires a deeper level of coordination among doctors than other Alzheimer\u2019s treatments, noted Radhakrishnan. Advertisement Prescribing doctors have to work with neurologists, radiologists and nurse practitioners to diagnose patients, confirm the presence of plaque in the brain, get them started on the treatment and then monitor them. \u201cAll of this is work in progress,\u201d Radhakrishnan said. Uncertainty about insurance coverage is another holdup. Some insurers have decided not to cover the drug. Others, including the major Medicare Advantage insurer Humana, haven\u2019t made a decision yet but are reviewing claims case by case in the meantime. The federal Medicare program is expected to make a national coverage determination by next spring that will lay out how it handles the drug. Advertisement Biogen executives said recently they think most sites that will offer the drug are waiting for clarity on reimbursement, including that Medicare decision. Medicare\u2019s determination looms large for the Cedars-Sinai experts. Tan said they know they should reach a decision before the Medicare decision prompts more patient inquiries. He said doctors also realize they aren\u2019t just evaluating Aduhelm: They\u2019re also thinking about how to handle similar treatments that could get FDA approval. Advertisement \u201cWe want to make sure we get it right,\u201d Tan said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

This Orbiting 'Pac-Man' May Help Solve The Space Junk Problem The video game-inspired spacecraft could catch space debris with one big chomp. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 5, 2015, 03:07 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There's a lot of stuff floating around the Earth, including dangerous space junk. In fact, more than 500,000 pieces of debris -- from defunct satellites and tools that drifted away during spacewalks to even frozen droplets of urine -- are orbiting our planet. The junk poses a huge collision-risk to current and future space missions. And now, scientists have proposed a new way to clean up all of that trash. Ecole Polytechnique F\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) Advertisement Researchers from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne have proposed what they are calling the Clean Space One Project to remove debris from orbit by using a \"Pac-Man\" satellite. What is that? Well, the satellite looks like this: The capture system -- a so-called \"Pac-Man.\" Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) When it encounters space debris, it acts like this: giphy Advertisement The video game-inspired design was chosen over a claw shape , as the most likely to be able to perform a precisely-timed capture, Space.com reported. The scientists plan to test out the design by sending the Pac-Man craft on a mission to collect and dispose of the small, now obsolete, SwissCube satellite that was launched in 2009. After it gobbles up the satellite, the Pac-Man will burn up in the atmosphere with its catch. Though the mission sounds straight forward, but it will take careful coordination. \" SwissCube is not only a 10-centimeter by 10-centimeter object that\u2019s tough to grasp, but it also has darker and lighter parts that reflect sunlight differently,\" Christophe Paccolat, a PhD student working in the institute's Center for Space Engineering and Signal Processing 5 Laboratory, said in a written statement. \"These variations can perturb the visual approach system and thus also the estimates of its speed and distance.\" Advertisement This is not the weirdest space clean-up method that has been suggested. Some scientists have proposed harpoon-like capture methods , while others hope to maneuver trash with pulses of air . Similar to the chomping Pac-Man, most methods rely on Earth's atmosphere to burn up the offending debris. For now, working models of the prototype Pac-Man system soon will be created. NBC News reported that Cleanspace One could launch as early as 2018.

Your Cat's Grooming Habits Could Solve A Huge Problem In Technology A new study classifies the many unique ways mammals and insects keep clean. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 10, 2015, 11:55 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT While hair keeps animals warm, it also creates a daily burden of maintenance. Adult cats, for instance, spend up to 50 percent of their day grooming. But not all animals keep clean in the same way. Some work hard for it, while others have developed more efficient mechanisms. According to a new study from David Hu, an associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and his mechanical engineering Ph.D. student, Guillermo Amador, understanding the different cleaning techniques that animals use could have implications for keeping man-made objects, including spaceships, free of pollutants and dirt. Advertisement \u201cDrones and other autonomous rovers, including our machines on Mars, are susceptible to failure because of the accumulation of airborne particles,\" Hu said in a release. Katrin Scharl via Getty Images The Georgia Tech team measured the surface area of 27 different mammals and insects and classified the many weird ways they keep clean. Advertisement \u201cA honeybee\u2019s true surface area is the size of a piece of toast,\u201d Hu said. \u201cA cat\u2019s is the size of a ping pong table. A sea otter has as much area as a professional hockey rink.\u201d And with a larger surface area often comes a greater challenge of staying unsoiled. \u201c Dogs shake water off their backs , just like a washing machine,\u201d Amador said. \u201cBees use bristled appendages to brush pollen off their eyes and bodies. Fruit flies use hairs on their head and thorax to catapult dust off of them at accelerations of up to 500 times Earth\u2019s gravity.\u201d This, for instance, is a honeybee wiping pollen from its head. Advertisement Other species, however, are fortunate to have cleaning techniques that require no energy at all. One example, as highlighted in the study, is eyelashes, which \"protect mammals by minimizing airflow and funneling particles away from eyes.\" Cicada wings are also especially efficient . Research has found they actually clean themselves, causing filth to jump right off of them with the aid of dew. \u201cUnderstanding how biological systems, like eyelashes, prevent soiling by interacting with the environment can help inspire low-energy solutions for keeping sensitive equipment free from dust and dirt,\u201d Hu said. Advertisement As for whether NASA will model a future planetary rover after an eyelash or cicada wing, that remains to be seen. The Georgia Tech team's study was published in the Journal of Experimental Biology.

Starry-Eyed Scientists Discover 'Beast Of A Galaxy Cluster' This thing is a star-making machine. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sep 11, 2015, 11:40 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A team of international astronomers has discovered a rare and colossal cluster of galaxies that is turning preconceived notions on their head -- and giving scientists plenty of fodder for inventive metaphors. According to a release, the discovery shows a \"beast of a galaxy cluster whose heart is bursting with new stars.\" SpARCS1049+56 -- as the cluster has been tagged -- is 9.8 billion light years from Earth , contains at least 27 individual galaxies and has a total mass equal to about 400 trillion suns. Advertisement Scientists say the dominant galaxy at the cluster's heart is stealing gas from a neighbor galaxy as it spits out an incredible 860 stars per year . For contrast, our Milky Way galaxy gives birth to only one or two new stars per year. A massive cluster of galaxies, called SpARCS1049+56, can be seen in this multi-wavelength view from NASA's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes. At the middle of the picture is the largest, central member of the family of galaxies (upper right red dot of central pair). Unlike other central galaxies in clusters, this one is bursting with the birth of new stars. NASA/STScI/ESA/JPL-Caltech/McGill The discovery -- originally made with telescopes atop Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island -- is the first to show that gigantic galaxies at the center of massive clusters can grow significantly by feeding off gas stolen from other galaxies . Advertisement Tracy Webb of McGill University in Montreal, the lead author of the study , said in a statement that usually stars at the centers of galaxy clusters are old and dead, essentially fossils. \"But we think the giant galaxy at the center of this cluster is furiously making new stars after merging with a smaller galaxy,\" she said. After making initial observations with the Hawaii telescopes, astronomers turned to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to pinpoint what was fueling the \" furious episode of new starbirth .\" Advertisement \"Hubble found a trainwreck of a merger at the centre of this cluster,\"Adam Muzzin of the University of Cambridge said in a release. There was also the presence of \" beads on a string ,\" or pockets of gas that condense where new stars are forming. CFH says such gas pockets are a telltale sign of collisions between gas-rich galaxies , a phenomenon known to astronomers as \"wet mergers,\" where gas is quickly converted to new stars. Dry mergers, on the other hand, occur when galaxies with little gas collide and no new stars are formed. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jun 27, 2021, 12:03 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A large skull discovered in China may be from an extremely close kin of modern humans, researchers have revealed. The previously unknown species of extinct ancient human, dubbed Homo longi or \u201cDragon Man,\u201d could replace Neanderthals as the nearest relative to modern Homo sapiens, according to the scientists, who published their findings Friday in the journal The Innovation . Advertisement The nearly perfectly preserved skull, known as the Harbin cranium, is more than 146,000 years old . Researchers believe the skull was discovered in 1933 when a bridge was built over the Songhua River in China\u2019s Heilongjiang province, but was only recently studied. It had been wrapped up by a farmer working on the bridge and hidden down an abandoned well. He finally told his grandchildren of its existence on his deathbed in 2018 and they turned it over to a university, Some Dragon Man\u2019s features notably resemble those of modern man, pointed out one of the authors of the studies on the fossil, Chris Stringer, who is a researcher at London\u2019s Natural History Museum \u201cIt has flat and low cheekbones ... and the face looks reduced and tucked under the brain case,\u201d he said in a statement. Advertisement The skull \u2014 about 9 inches long and more than 6 inches wide \u2014 is also large enough to hold a brain similar in size to that of modern humans. Researchers believe it belonged to a male about 50 years old. \u201cIn terms of fossils in the last million years, this is one of the most important yet discovered ,\u201d Stringer told BBC News. \u201cWhat you have here is a separate branch of humanity that is not on its way to becoming Homo sapiens (our species), but represents a long-separate lineage which evolved in the region for several hundred thousand years and eventually went extinct,\u201d Stringer added. Advertisement Other scientists aren\u2019t yet certain what position Dragon Man holds on the human family tree \u2014 or if he even represents a separate species. But research lead author Xijun Ni, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Hebei GEO University in Shijiazhuang, is convinced: \u201cWe found our long-lost sister lineage.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It\u2019s \u201cwidely believed that the Neanderthal belongs to an extinct lineage that is the closest relative of our own species. However, our discovery suggests that the new lineage we identified, that includes Homo longi, is the actual sister group of Homo sapiens ,\u201d he explained. Advertisement Chinese researchers unveil ancient skull that could belong to a completely new species of human https://t.co/Ve5raGIwFG \u2014 BBC Breaking News (@BBCBreaking) June 25, 2021 Scientists believe that Dragon Man was powerfully built. But little is known about how he lived, because his skull was removed from the site where it was found. So scientists are unable to search for tools and food linked to Dragon Man that would begin to tell the tale of his life.

NASA Spots Snow On Pluto's Mountain Peaks Now all we need is a spaceship and some skis. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Mar 4, 2016, 01:08 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Forecast says: snow on Pluto. Images collected by the New Horizons spacecraft show \" exotic snowcapped mountains \" in the southeast corner of the Cthulhu Regio, a dark stretch of the dwarf planet approximately the size of Alaska, according to NASA. Scientists believe the snow is composed mostly of frozen methane that condensed from Pluto's atmosphere. Advertisement \"That this material coats only the upper slopes of the peaks suggests methane ice may act like water in Earth's atmosphere, condensing as frost at high altitude,\" said John Stansberry, a New Horizons scientist. This color-enhanced image highlights the region where scientists say they found snow on Pluto. NASA Color-enhanced photos released by NASA show the mountain range where the snow was found. Reddish areas highlight the plains, craters and valleys around the mountains. The bright, light-colored peaks are believed to be coated in frozen methane.

You Guys, There Is An Adorable Heart On The Sun It's pretty sweet. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Apr 14, 2016, 12:02 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A giant sunspot has apparently turned on its love light, morphing into the shape of a heart. Known as AR2529 , the dazzling area will face Earth for approximately one more week, according to The Washington Post. A sunspot is a region on the sun's surface that is temporarily cool and dark compared to the surrounding area. How cool could that be? Advertisement According to NASA, \" the average surface temperature of the sun is 6000 degrees Celsius and ... sunspots are about 1500 degrees Celsius cooler than the area surrounding them (still very hot).\" Sunspots are known for being associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections, but this one has been relatively temperate outside of releasing a small CME on Sunday, Space.com reported. (NASA explains the difference between the two here .) According to Space.com, the region is the size of several planet Earths . That's big enough to be viewed by amateur astronomers, but don't even think about snapping a picture unless you have the proper safety equipment.

'Bombshell' Study Shows Our Brains Are Even More Awesome Than We Knew The human brain's memory capacity has been shown to be 10 times greater than previous research had suggested. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jan 22, 2016, 11:42 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT In a finding they're calling a \"real bombshell in the field of neuroscience,\" researchers have uncovered evidence that the human brain's memory capacity is an order of magnitude greater than previously thought. \"Our new measurements of the brain's memory capacity increase conservative estimates by a factor of 10 to at least a petabyte,\" Dr. Terry Sejnowski, a professor at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, and co-senior author of a paper describing the research, said in a written statement. Advertisement In other words, the human brain may be able to store one petabyte of data, which is 1 quadrillion bytes. That's enough memory to store 13.3 years of high-definition video . The finding, published recently in the journal eLife, is considered preliminary and must be confirmed by future research. But it constitutes a significant advance in our understanding of neuroanatomy and could prove to be a step toward the creation of a complete \"wiring diagram\" of the human brain, Sejnowsky told The Huffington Post. In addition, the finding could point the way to a new generation of computers that combine enormous processing power with low energy consumption. Such \"probabilistic\" computing devices -- so called because they process data in a way that is more intuitive than conventional computers -- are considered a game-changer for applications ranging from translation to machine vision. Advertisement \u201cWe have to think of the brain not as an old grandfather clock but as a high-precision watch.\"\u201d Sejnowski and his collaborators at Salk and the University of Texas at Austin made the discovery as part of a detailed anatomical examination and subsequent 3D computer reconstruction of the cells within a tiny portion of tissue from the brain of a rat. The reconstruction showed that the variation in the sizes of the synapses within the sample -- the tiny gaps between brain cells that are known to be key to memory formation and storage -- was far smaller than previous research had suggested. In fact, the synapses varied in size by only about 8 percent. (Synapses in the rat brain are believed to be similar to those in the human brain.) Advertisement \"No one thought it would be such a small difference,\" Dr. Tom Bartol, a staff scientist at the institute and one of the researchers, said in the statement. \"This was a curveball from nature.\" When the researchers plugged the 8-percent figure into their computer model of the brain, they determined that there must be more than two dozen discrete sizes of synapse rather than just a few. That bigger number, in turn, meant that the synapses must be able to store far more information than anyone knew. Advertisement Having more \"bits\" per synapse is a little like a high-definition TV having more bits per pixel than a conventional TV, Sejnowski said, adding that, \"We think the brain is high-resolution now.\" Or, offering up another metaphor, he said, \"We have to think of the brain not as an old grandfather clock but as a high-precision watch.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Some scientists think that the human brain is capable of storing even more information. The brain's true memory capacity may be even greater -- as much as 3 to 5 petabytes , Dr. Paul Reber, director of the Brain, Behavior, & Cognition program in the psychology department at Northwestern University, told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

LEAVE A COMMENT For Dr. Jean Bennett, it started with a microscope as a gift. A gift from her father when she was 8 years old sent Jean Bennett onto a career path in science and medicine, one that will benefit generations to come. Bennett\u2019s late father, William R. Bennett, was a physicist, inventor and co-developer of the gas laser while working at Bell Laboratories in the 1960s. The laser he developed \u2013 and received a patent on \u2015 is used in surgeries and every retail checkout for the past few decades. And the gift he gave his daughter was a microscope. Advertisement \u201cHe was a total inspiration in terms of my interest in science and love of biology because I also worked in various labs in elementary school,\u201d says Bennett, professor of ophthalmology of the Center for Advanced Retinal and Ocular Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, and a featured researcher in the documentary, \u201cThe Gene Doctors,\u201d airing through Nov. 7 on PBS.org . It will then stream on Amazon Prime beginning Nov. 8. Her father was a professor at Yale University, and growing up in New Haven, Connecticut presented many opportunities for her to have part time jobs in research labs. \u201cI knew I wanted to go into basic research,\u201d she says. After graduating from Yale undergraduate in 1976, and earning a masters in biology in graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley in 1980, Bennett then went on to University of California-San Francisco because she did not like the competitiveness of pre-med programs, and wanted to concentrate on research. Advertisement Years before the genome project was even launched, she was working in the UCSF lab on studying the genes of mammals. She asked her mentor how this work could transfer to humans. He told her to study the roots of diseases by going to medical school. So she did. Bennett enrolled at Harvard Medical School and began work on gene therapy. With funding from a $50,000 grant, her career was launched and she arrived at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992, as one of only two female professors on the medical school faculty. \u201cTo them summer vacation was leaving at 5 p.m.,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cThings have changed a lot in 25 years\u201d for women in science and medicine, Bennet says, \u201cBut it\u2019s not ideal. It\u2019s not 50/50.\u201d Of the 669 full professors at Penn Med today, 24 percent, or 163 are women. Advertisement As one of the doctors featured in the documentary from HHMI Tangled Bank Studios on genetic illnesses, Bennett says he hopes to bring more awareness to the \u201corphan diseases\u201d that each affect fewer than 10,000 people, but collectively affect more than a million babies born each year with these rare diseases. The exposure from the one-hour documentary has been enormous. \u201cI\u2019m a shy kind of person,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cBut I love sharing the stories and my enthusiasm for the work.\u201d While funding is difficult in this climate, and Bennett says for large grants for instance, male co-investigators tend to take the dominant portion of the grant, \u201cignore the gender differences and try to explain the work and show the outcomes.\u201d Advertisement The outcomes are nearly miraculous. Boys and girls should be encouraged at an early age to study STEM, Bennett says. \u201cI am cognizant of the challenges for women and I have a lot of trainees in my lab,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cI want them to see what is possible.\u201d Yet, teachers may not feel prepared. A new study from SAM Labs shows that 78 percent of U.S. teachers feel they have not received enough training to be able to teach technology in the classroom. According to SAMS, \u201cEighty-two percent of U.S. teachers believe that students who use technology in the classroom are more prepared for their future careers. And while 42 percent of teachers do feel that technology in the classroom further supports students\u2019 interests in math and science, the benefits extend beyond tech-oriented subjects.\u201d Advertisement Joachim Horn, CEO of SAM Labs , adds, \u201cBecause they are on the front lines with students every day, teachers are in the best position to identify the opportunities \u2013 and the challenges \u2013 that the government will face in supporting students\u2019 education. By first focusing on how we can support and train our educators, we will quickly see U.S. students excel in STEM.\u201d Support in education may begin early, but needs to extend throughout a science career. Recognizing the need for funding of women in science for what is possible, L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA recently announced five recipients of the 2017 For Women in Science Fellowship , honoring female scientists at a critical stage in their careers with $60,000 grants to advance their postdoctoral research. Celebrating its 14th year in the U.S., L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA\u2019s For Women in Science fellowship program has awarded 70 postdoctoral women scientists over $3.5 million in grants. \u201cWomen make up nearly half of the workforce but hold only a quarter of STEM jobs in the U.S.,\u201d says Lauren Paige, vice president of public affairs & strategic initiatives at L\u2019Oreal USA. Advertisement This program assists \u201cwomen postdoctoral scientists at a pivotal moment in their careers where additional support can help ensure they reach the highest levels of science. We believe that by recognizing and rewarding leading women scientists for their innovative research and dedication to inspiring the next generation of women in STEM we can help increase the representation of women in STEM fields,\u201d Paige says. From genetics to quantum physics, the five 2017 fellows are Kellie Ann Jurado, a postdoctoral scientist in Immunobiology at Yale University; Felicity Muth, a postdoctoral fellow in Biology at University of Nevada, Reno; Ritu Raman, a postdoctoral fellow in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Sydney Schreppler, a postdoctoral fellow in Physics at University of California, Berkeley; and Molly Schumer, a postdoctoral fellow in Genetics and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard Medical School. \u201cToday, more than ever, we are proud to support our country\u2019s most accomplished women scientists at a key moment in their careers, and to empower them to continue their groundbreaking work,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Roz\u00e9, President and CEO of L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA. Advertisement These private sector initiatives are critically important to advances in science. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to carry out basic research now,\u201d Bennett says. \u201cAlmost impossible.\u201d She adds,\u201dYou cannot be a tenured professor without two large grants,\u201d she says. \u201cThis will cause major problems in women doing science down the road. \u201c Other top women leaders in science agree there are challenges for women in STEM. Dr. Christyl Johnson, deputy director for technology and research investments at National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, at the recent the Advancing Women in STEM session at the 2017 United Nations Women Global Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship Industry Forum in New York, told Elana Lyn Gross writes at Forbes, \u201cWomen bring to the table an amazing, unique perspective that should absolutely be celebrated. I learned that when I was a manager for a team. \u201c Dr. Johnson tells Gross the story of a senior chief engineer on a problem solving task. \u201cHe would walk into the laboratory and tell the engineers that were under me, \u2018You need to try this. Tweak this over here. Make this adjustment.\u2019 I said, \u2018You can\u2019t just walk in and do that.\u2019 \u201c Advertisement Dr. Johnson tells Gross, \u201cWhen you have a problem and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing that problem, you need to be methodical about what you change so that you can pinpoint exactly what caused the problem and exactly what needs to be done to fix it.\u201d A summit of female scientists and leaders November 8 in Washington D.C., In Pursuit: An Atlantic Summit on Women & Science , is underwritten by L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA and \u201cwill bring together leading scientific experts to highlight recent achievements by women in STEM as well as strategies for ensuring that more female innovators flourish in the field,\u201d according to the site. \u201cDespite the tremendous impact of just a handful of women scientists, only 24 percent of today\u2019s STEM workers are female. How does this substantial gender gap impact the economy, human development and the environment? And what can be done to pave the way for today\u2019s women scientists \u2015 and future women scientists \u2015 to unleash the discoveries of tomorrow?\u201d according to the site. Advertisement Bennett, whose daughter is a post-doctoral scientist, says she emphasizes the importance of the research and discoveries of women in STEM, with an eye toward more future advancement for women scientists. \u201cI get to do exciting work and be gratified,\u201d Bennett says. Since the airing on PBS of the documentary that features her gene therapy successes in restoring sight and moving toward disease cures, she says, \u201cWe had an FDA meeting to review the data from our study and they unanimously approved it.\u201d She adds, \u201cI am a leader.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Stunning 'Einstein Ring' Seen In Photo Of Faraway Galaxy Stunning Photo Reveals Galaxy 12 Billion Light-Years Away By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 8, 2015, 02:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A brilliant \"ring of fire\" has been spotted in deep space, giving astronomers a rare glimpse of a galaxy 12 billion light-years away. The near-perfect \"Einstein ring\" was captured at a super-high resolution of 23 milliarcseconds by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) , a ground telescope in the Atacama desert in Northern Chile. (Scroll down for images.) \"With the astounding level of detail in these new ALMA images , astronomers will now be able to reassemble the information contained in the distorted image we see as a ring and produce a reconstruction of the true image of the distant galaxy,\" ALMA deputy program scientist Catherine Vlahakis said in a written statement. Advertisement (Story continues below images.) ALMA image of galaxy SDP.81. The bright orange central region of the ring (ALMA's highest resolution observation ever) reveals the glowing dust in this distant galaxy. ALMA/Hubble composite image of galaxy SDP.81. The bright orange central region reveals the glowing dust in this distant galaxy, and the diffuse blue element at the center of the ring is from an intermediate galaxy, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope. The images feature the active star-forming galaxy SDP.81 , which appears magnified and ring-like due to a strange phenomenon called gravitational lensing . Advertisement The phenomenon is predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity , which says that gravity bends the path of light . If two objects line up just right, the gravitational pull from one can bend the light coming from the other -- like a lens -- and even shape that light into a perfect ring as viewed from Earth.

NASA Just Tested The Most Powerful Rocket Booster In History The booster generated 3.6 million pounds of thrust. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jun 29, 2016, 04:29 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING NASA fired up a booster for the most powerful rocket in the world on Tuesday, testing what will become part of the Space Launch System. SLS, as it's known, will ultimately be used to launch Orion spacecraft on deep-space missions, including a planned trip to Mars. Advertisement \"Seeing this test today, and experiencing the sound and feel of approximately 3.6 million pounds of thrust , helps us appreciate the progress we\u2019re making to advance human exploration and open new frontiers for science and technology missions in deep space,\" William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, said in a news release. Until now, the most powerful rocket in history was the Saturn V used in the Apollo program. Tuesday's firing at Orbital ATK 's test facilities in Promontory, Utah, allowed NASA engineers to gather data on 82 qualification objectives, which will now be evaluated, the space agency said. Advertisement When used in deep space missions, the SLS will be powered by two five-segment boosters and four RS-25 main engines, or the same engines that powered the space shuttle program. The first SLS configuration will have a lift capability of 70 metric tons and 10 percent more thrust than Saturn V, while the next stage will have a lift capacity of 105 metric tons and 20 percent more thrust , according to NASA. Advertisement That second configuration would have the horsepower equivalent to 208,000 Corvette engines, or 17,400 locomotive engines. \"SLS hardware is currently in production for every part of the rocket. NASA also is making progress every day on Orion and the ground systems to support a launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida,\" John Honeycutt, SLS program manager at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, said in a news release. \"We're on track to launch SLS on its first flight test with Orion and pave the way for a human presence in deep space.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Hubble Space Telescope Shatters Cosmic Distance Record, Spots Oldest Galaxy Ever Found Galaxy GN-z11 is located 13.4 billion light years from Earth. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 4, 2016, 05:27 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The Hubble Space Telescope has been \u201cpushed to its limits,\u201d and the result is a total shocker. On Friday, NASA announced that the telescope had seen farther back in time than ever before , successfully observing the most distant (and oldest) galaxy in the universe to date. The galaxy, dubbed GN-z11, is located a record 13.4 billion light years from Earth -- that\u2019s just 400 million years after the Big Bang -- in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major. (In case you need an astronomy refresher, distance and age are linked here. The farther away an object is from Earth, the more time it takes for its light to reach us.) Advertisement \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a major step back in time, beyond what we\u2019d ever expected to be able to do with Hubble,\u201d said Yale University astronomer Pascal Oesch in a news release. \u201cWe see GN-z11 at a time when the universe was only three percent of its current age.\u201d The previous record-holder for the most distant galaxy was known as EGS8p7 , located some 13.24 billion light years from Earth, or 573 million years after the Big Bang. NASA, ESA, and A. Feild (STScI) Advertisement Just how do astronomers measure such large distances? Due to an expanding universe, distant objects appear to be moving away from Earth as its light is stretched to longer, redder wavelengths, a phenomenon known as \u201ccosmological redshift.\u201d Determining a galaxy's redshift can indicate its distance away from Earth. \u201cThe greater the redshift, the farther the galaxy,\u201d NASA explained. The space agency said the telescope's latest finding revealed \u201csurprising new clues\u201d about the beginnings of our universe. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Ice-Spewing Volcanoes On Pluto Leave Scientists Baffled \"Nothing like this has ever been seen in the outer solar system.\" Irene Klotz Nov 9, 2015, 08:00 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov 9 (Reuters) - Scientists have discovered what appear to be ice-spewing volcanoes on the surface of Pluto, raising questions about how the tiny, distant world has been so geologically active, according to research presented on Monday. The findings, released at an American Astronomical Society meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, paint a far more complicated picture of Pluto and its moons than scientists imagined. \u201cThe Pluto system is baffling us,\u201d planetary scientist Alan Stern, with the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told reporters during a webcast news conference. Stern heads the team working on NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft, which made an unprecedented pass by Pluto on July 14. Pictures and measurements taken during the encounter are still being transmitted back to Earth. Among 50 reports that New Horizons scientists will present this week is a startling look at two mountains on the surface of Pluto, each measuring more than 100 miles (161 km) in diameter and several miles (km) in height. The tops of the mountains have depressions similar to volcanoes found on Mars and Earth. \u201cNothing like this has ever been seen in the outer solar system,\u201d said New Horizons scientist Oliver White, with NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. Rather than spewing molten rock, volcanoes on Pluto would have released frozen water, and other ices such as nitrogen, ammonia or methane. White admits the idea of volcanoes on Pluto, which is about 30 times farther away from the sun than Earth, sounds crazy, \u201cbut it\u2019s the least crazy thing we can thing of\u201d to explain the mountains. \u201cWhatever they are, they\u2019re definitely weird,\u201d White said. New Horizons also found several deep fractures in Pluto\u2019s surface, the largest of which spans more than 200 miles (322 km)in length. The top of the fracture is about 2.5 miles (4 km)higher than the base - more than twice as high as walls of the Grand Canyon. \u201cThe fact that there are so many large faults in this part of Pluto indicates that the crust has experienced a major extension at some point in its history,\u201d White said. Scientists suspect the decay of naturally occurring radioactive elements in Pluto\u2019s core was the heat source for its transformation. New Horizons is on track for a possible January 2019 pass by another frozen mini world in the Kuiper Belt region of the solar system, which is home to Pluto, its moons and thousands of other icy bodies.

This Star Is So Powerful It Could Rival A Black Hole The star is spewing out powerful jets of material into space. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 5, 2015, 12:38 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A super-dense neutron star some 4,400 light-years away is not shy about showing off its strength. According to a new study, the star -- which is named PSR J1023+0038 and has a companion star -- is shooting jets of gas into space with a strength that researchers previously thought was unique to black holes. These jets are formed when the neutron star's gravity pulls gas from its companion star, and some of the gas gets blasted outward. \" Black holes were previously considered the undisputed kings of forming powerful jets, even when they were only fed by a little bit of material from their companion star,\" Dr. Adam Deller, astronomer at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy and lead author of the study, said in a written statement. \"In comparison, neutron stars seemed to make relatively puny jets, which only became bright enough to see when the neutron stars were gobbling gas from their companions at a very high rate.\" (Story continues below image.) An artist's impression of the binary star system PSR J1023 0038. The extremely dense, rapidly-spinning neutron star, just 10-15 kilometers in size, is in a close orbit with a more normal companion star. ICRAR Advertisement A neutron star is a relatively small celestial object made up of closely packed neutron particles . They are formed when a once-large star explodes into a supernova, leaving behind only the central core. \"And the central parts of the star collapse under their own gravity,\" Dr. James Miller-Jones, astronomer at the Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy in Western Australia and co-author of the study, said in the written statement. \"These things are typically about one and a half times the mass of the sun and yet they're only 10-15 kilometers across, so they're incredibly dense.\" For the study, astronomers used the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico to take a close look at the neutron star, which was originally discovered in 2009. The astronomers analyzed their 2013 and 2014 radio and x-ray observations of the star and noticed that it was producing much stronger jets than expected. Advertisement Miller-Jones said that this study casts neutron stars in a new light, and shows that these celestial objects can sometimes launch jets that rival those coming from black holes. The study was published online in the Astrophysical Journal on August 4, 2015.

Researchers Unearth Shocking Hunter-Gatherer Massacre Scene The findings challenge our understanding of the roots of conflict. Marta Mirazon Lahr | University of Cambridge \u2014 The Conversation Jan 22, 2016, 06:38 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Skull of a man with multiple lesions on the side, probably caused by a club. Image by Marta Mirazon Lahr, enhanced by Fabio Lahr. Marta Mirazon Lahr | Fabio Lahr The area surrounding Lake Turkana in Kenya was lush and fertile 10,000 years ago, with thousands of animals \u2013 including elephants, giraffes and zebras \u2013 roaming around alongside groups of hunter gatherers. But it also had a dark side. We have discovered the oldest known case of violence between two groups of hunter gatherers took place there, with ten excavated skeletons showing evidence of having been killed with both sharp and blunt weapons. The findings, published in Nature , are important because they challenge our understanding of the roots of conflict and suggest warfare may have a much older history than many researchers believe. Advertisement Shocking finding Our journey started in 2012, when Pedro Ebeya, one of our Turkana field assistants, reported seeing fragments of human bones on the surface at Nataruk. Located just south of Lake Turkana, Nataruk is today a barren desert, but 10,000 years ago was a temporary camp set up by a band of hunter-gatherers next to a lagoon. I led a team of researchers, as part of the In-Africa project , which has been working in the area since 2009. We excavated the remains of 27 people \u2013 six young children, one teenager and 20 adults. Twelve of these \u2013 both men and women \u2013 were found as they had died, unburied, and later covered by the shallow water of the lagoon. Ten of the 12 skeletons show lesions caused by violence to the parts of the body most commonly involved in cases of violence. These include one where the projectile was still embedded in the side of the skull; two cases of sharp-force trauma to the neck; seven cases of blunt and/or sharp-force trauma to the head; two cases of blunt-force trauma to the knees and one to the ribs. There were also two cases of fractures to the hands, possibly caused while parrying a blow. There must have at least three types of weapons involved in these murders \u2013 projectiles (stoned-tipped as well as sharpened arrows), something similar to a club, and something close to a wooden handle with hafted sharp-stone blades that caused deep cuts. Two individuals have no lesions in the preserved parts of the skeleton, but the position of their hands suggests they may have been bound, including a young woman who was heavily pregnant at the time. Advertisement Me and my colleague, Justus Edung, during the excavations. Robert Foley We dated the remains and the site to between 10,500 and 9,500 years ago, making them the earliest scientifically dated case of a conflict between two groups of hunter-gatherers. Stones in the weapons include obsidian, a rare stone in the Nataruk area, suggesting the attackers came from a different place. The (pre)history of warfare Today we think of warfare, or inter-group conflict, as something that happens when one group of people wants the territory, resources or power held by another. But prehistoric societies were usually small groups of nomads moving from place to place \u2013 meaning they didn\u2019t own land or have significant possessions. They typically didn\u2019t have strong social hierarchies either. Therefore, many scholars have argued that warfare must have emerged after farming and more complex political systems arose. Advertisement Naturuk therefore challenges our views about what the causes of conflict are. It is possible that human prehistoric societies simply responded antagonistically to chance encounters with another group. But this is not what seems to have happened at Nataruk. The group which attacked was carrying weapons that would not normally be carried while hunting and fishing. In addition, the lesions show that clubs of at least two sizes were used, making it likely that more than one of the attackers were carrying them. Man with an obsidian bladelet embedded into the left side of his skull, and a projectile lesion (possibly of a sharpened arrow shaft) on the right side of the skull. Marta Mirazon Lahr The fact that the attack combined long-distance weapons such as arrows and close-proximity weaponry such as clubs suggests they planned the attack. Also, there are other, but isolated, examples of violent trauma in this area from this period in time \u2013 one discovered in the 1970s about 20km north of Nataruk, and two discovered by our project at a nearby site. All three involved projectiles, one of the hallmarks of inter-group conflict. Two of the projectiles found embedded in the bones at Nataruk and in two of the other cases were made of obsidian. This tells us that such attacks happened multiple times, and were part of the life of the hunter-gatherer communities at the time. Advertisement So why were the people of Nataruk attacked? We have to conclude that they had valuable resources that were worth fighting for \u2013 water, meat, fish, nuts, or indeed women and children. This suggests that two of the conditions associated with warfare among settled societies \u2013 territory and resources \u2013 were probably common among these hunter-gatherers, and that we have underestimated their role so far. Evolution is about survival, and our species is no different from others in this respect. The injuries suffered by the people of Nataruk are merciless and shocking, but no different from those suffered in wars throughout much of our history \u2013 sadly even today. It may be human nature, but we should not forget that extraordinary acts of altruism , compassion and caring are also unique parts of who we are. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

As World Turns More Slowly, We Face Earthquake Boom, Scientists Warn The number of severe quakes could triple next year. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Nov 21, 2017, 12:15 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING More powerful earthquakes could rock the globe in 2018 because of infinitesimal changes in the speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation, scientists warn. It seems contradictory, but a minuscule slowing of the Earth\u2019s rotation over years, which can extend the length of a day by a millisecond or more, appears to be linked to an increase in major quakes. Advertisement Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana say that historical data since 1900 clearly reveal a \u201cstrong\u201d link between major global earthquake activity and a slight slowing of the Earth\u2019s rotation for five or six years. That has occurred approximately every 32 years. If that pattern continues, the number of powerful quakes in the coming year could triple, according to the researchers. \u201cOn five occasions in the past century, a 25 [to] 30 percent increase in annual numbers of earthquakes [of a magnitude 7.0 or greater] has coincided with a slowing in the mean rotation velocity of the earth,\u201d the scientists noted in a research abstract . They presented their findings recently at a meeting of the Geological Society of America . \u201cNext year we should see a significant increase in numbers of severe earthquakes,\u201d Bilham warned in an interview with The Observer. \u201cWe have had it easy this year. So far we have only had about six severe earthquakes. We could easily have 20 a year starting in 2018.\u201d Advertisement The researchers don\u2019t understand precisely the dynamics that may explain what\u2019s happening when the Earth slows. As the Earth\u2019s rotation slows, the diameter of the equator shrinks, essentially \u201crumpling\u201d the tectonic plates nearby and increasing the likelihood of a major earthquake where the plates connect, Bilham explained on the BBC radio program \u201cScience in Action.\u201d Historically, most earthquake upticks linked to a slower planet rotation occurred near the equator in the West and East Indies, according to the scientists. Since 1900, more than 80 percent of all major quakes on the eastern Caribbean plate boundary, including the 2010 Haiti quake, have occurred five years following a \u201cmaximum deceleration\u201d of the Earth\u2019s rotation, according to Bilham and Bendick.

By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Apr 3, 2021, 10:08 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists were scratching their heads after hundreds of writhing worms formed a cyclone shape on a sidewalk in New Jersey . The strange incident occurred after heavy rains in Hoboken , across the Hudson River from Manhattan, earlier this month. Masses of worms emerging from the soil after downpours is not unusual \u2014 but the size of this group and the odd formation baffled experts. Advertisement Worms breathe through their skin, and must often tunnel to the surface to survive heavy rains . They also sometimes form \u201cherds\u201d when they surface and can move collectively through some kind of \u201c consensual decision phenomenon ,\u201d Belgian researchers noted in 2010. \u201cOur results modify the current view that earthworms are animals lacking in social behavior,\u201d noted Lara Zirbes, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. student at the time at the University of Liege in Gembloux. The worms form clusters and \u201cinfluence each other to select a common direction,\u201d the group of researchers theorized. \u201cWe can consider the earthworm behavior as the equivalent of a herd or swarm ,\u201d according to Zirbes. The unusual worm confab drew attention after a New Jersey woman who first spotted the annelids earlier this month sent photos to Hoboken City Council member Tiffanie Fisher, who posted them on Twitter. Fisher later tweeted a link to an article on the Belgian research post by the California Academy of Sciences, and explained that she had learned that \u201cearthworm herding is a thing.\u201d Advertisement Worm Tornado? Has anyone ever seen anything like this? These were out this morning near Maxwell park in #Hoboken . Clearly worms come out after it rains but this is something I\u2019ve never seen! Pc: my 2nd ward neighbor. #wormtornado \ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u2640\ufe0f \ud83e\udeb1 \ud83c\udf2a pic.twitter.com/tWBOMzV5fK \u2014 Tiffanie Fisher, Councilwoman (@Tiffanie_Fisher) March 25, 2021 Many of the Hoboken worms were in a giant swirl on the sidewalk, though a few were still squirming into position when the local resident had spotted them, the woman told Live Science. What caused the shape? \u201cThis tornado shape is really interesting ,\u201d Kyungsoo Yoo, a professor in the Department of Soil, Water, and Climate at the University of Minnesota, told Live Science. But he didn\u2019t have a clue about the shape and said he had never before seen earthworms in a spiral. Advertisement Saad Bhamla , assistant professor of Georgia Tech\u2019s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, speculated that sudden changes in water in the soil and the shape of the landscape could have contributed to the worm arrangement. \u201cThe ground there could be dipped ,\u201d Bhamla told Live Science. \u201cIf the water drained that way after flooding, the worms could be following a water gradient.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Bhamla, head of the Bhamla Lab at Georgia Tech, which has studied aquatic California black worms, said they have been observed \u201cfollowing trails of water\u201d to \u201cform all kinds of paths and aggregate structures.\u201d Worms that mass together ( often in blobs ) are less likely to dry out than solitary worms,\u201d he noted.

Ghostly Faces Appear In Medieval 'Black Book of Carmarthen' Ghostly Faces Appear In Medieval 'Black Book' By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Apr 9, 2015, 05:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A legendary medieval book has revealed secret images that have been hiding in the margins for centuries -- including ghostly faces and long-lost poetry. Written in 1250, the \" Black Book of Carmarthen \" is the oldest remaining medieval manuscript written solely in Welsh. It contains prophetic poems and stories of legends and heroes from the Dark Ages, including some of the earliest references to King Arthur and Merlin the wizard (referred to in the text as Myrddin the \"wild man\"). Advertisement But a new analysis by University of Cambridge researchers using ultraviolet light and photo editing software shows the book once contained even more: pictures and text drawn in the margins, including ghostly faces that have recently captured the imagination of people around the world : ( Story continues below image. ) \u201cThe margins of manuscripts often contain medieval and early modern reactions to the text , and these can cast light on what our ancestors thought about what they were reading,\" Myriah Williams, a PhD student in Cambridge\u2019s Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic said in a news release. \"The Black Book was particularly heavily annotated before the end of the 16th century, and the recovery of erasure has much to tell us about what was already there and can change our understanding of it.\u201d It's believed that a cleric and manuscript collector named Jaspar Gryffyth , who acquired the book in the 16th century, erased all the drawings and extra writings in the margins of the book. Advertisement The researchers believe some of the poems found hidden in the margins are previously unrecorded in Welsh literature. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to think we know all we can know about a manuscript like the Black Book but to see these ghosts from the past brought back to life in front of our eyes has been incredibly exciting,\" said Williams. \"The drawings and verse that we\u2019re in the process of recovering demonstrate the value of giving these books another look.\" The researchers plan to continue to examine the book in the hopes of uncovering more lost text and images. Advertisement \u201cWhat we have discovered may only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of what can be discovered as imaging techniques are enhanced,\u201d Prof. Paul Russel, also of Cambridge, was quoted as saying. \u201cThe manuscript is extremely valuable and incredibly important -\u2013 yet there may still be so much we don\u2019t know about it.\u201d Named for the color of its binding, the \"Black Book of Carmarthen\" measures roughly 6.6 inches by 5 inches and is printed on vellum, or animal skin. It's currently housed in the National Library of Wales and is part of an exhibition on Sir John Prise, a 16th-century manuscript collector who at one time owned the book. The exhibition, which runs through June, is called \" Publisher and Plunderer?: Sir John Prise and the first Welsh books .\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Who Says Funny Women Aren't Sexy? Psychologists find that humor makes men -- but not women -- appear more attractive to potential romantic partners. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Sep 12, 2015, 07:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Bravo via Getty Images \"A man can laugh a woman into bed, but funny females aren't attractive .\" At least that's what the Daily Mail made of a provocative new study on the role of humor in romantic attraction. The University of Kansas study , which was published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, found that men who are able to make women laugh are more likely to win their affection. Funny women, however, were not any more attractive to prospective male partners. Advertisement Is the takeaway really that funny women aren't sexy, as the British tabloid would have us believe? \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d says Dr. Jeffrey Hall, a communications professor at the university and the study's lead author. \"The traditional sexual script in courtship ... includes all kind of expectations about how men and women are supposed to behave,\" Hall told The Huffington Post in an email. \"Despite meaningful changes in the role of women in society, the script persists in influencing how men and women relate to one another.\" Hall explained that men and women tend to use humor in different ways in romantic situations. While men generally use humor as a way to make a woman comfortable and gauge her interest in him, women assess a man's humor as a means of predicting the partnership's potential. In other words, men \"entertain, cajole, and generate playful banter,\" while women evaluate and laugh along if they approve of the man's behavior. Women, according to the study, don't use their own humor to help influence or assess a romantic situation. Advertisement \"There are many people who would argue that there is something inherently sexist with the script,\" Hall said. \"I would agree with that criticism inasmuch that it puts limits on women\u2019s behavior and plays to stereotypes about how a man and a woman is supposed to be.\" So is there any hope for changing these scripts? Wendi Aarons, an award-winning humor writer and blogger, has some suggestions for challenging sexist behavioral norms. \"By women not giving a f**k if a man thinks they're funny or not,\" Aarons told The Huffington Post. \"By men being secure enough to know that they don't always have to try to be the funniest person in the room and that's okay.\" Advertisement The findings shouldn't be interpreted as suggesting that men don\u2019t value a sense of humor in a romantic partner. The study also found that when men and women laughed together , they were both more interested in each other. \"The best chance of mutual attraction and mutual romantic interest is when both people are laughing,\" Hall said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Both women and men consider humor an important trait in a romantic interest because it suggests the promise of a fun and joyful future relationship, Hall argues, and Aarons agrees.

Try \"M\u00e1az.\" By Jeremy Blum Reporter, HuffPost Mar 12, 2021, 06:15 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING In a joint effort with the Navajo Nation, NASA is naming landmasses and other notable features on the surface of Mars after words in the Navajo language. The first of these is a rock identified by NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet last month. It is called \u201cM\u00e1az,\u201d the Navajo word for Mars. Advertisement A rock, named \u201cM\u00e1az\u201d (the Navajo word for Mars), currently under study by NASA\u2019s Perseverance Mars rover. NASA/JPL-Caltech The teams behind the Perseverance\u2019s mission worked with a Navajo engineer, Aaron Yazzie of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, in conjunction with the Navajo Nation to develop a list of 50 terms that could be used for naming purposes, according to a NASA press release issued on Thursday. Several of the terms were inspired by the rugged terrain the Perseverance \u2014 translated in Navajo to \u201cHa\u2019ah\u00f3ni\u201d \u2014 has encountered on Mars\u2019 surface; for instance, \u201cts\u00e9w\u00f3z\u00ed bee hazhmeezh,\u201d which can be translated as \u201crolling rows of pebbles, like waves.\u201d Advertisement Other potential names on the list included the Navajo words for strength (bidziil), respect (ho\u0142 nil\u012f\u0301), red rock (ts\u00e9 \u0142ich\u00ed\u00ed), diligence (y\u00e9igo) and \u201camongst the sand\u201d (s\u00e9\u00edtah). I have been so excited about this collaboration between @NASAPersevere \u2019s team and the #Navajo Nation & @NNPrezNez !! There is a press release coming out soon to talk about how this came about. But yes, Perseverance will be using the Navajo language to name science targets on Mars! https://t.co/wtTwyJVSmb \u2014 Aaron Yazzie (@YazzieSays) March 11, 2021 Yazzie said that using the language in such a manner was a unique opportunity \u201cto inspire Navajo youth not just through amazing scientific and engineering feats, but also through the inclusion of our language in such a meaningful way.\u201d Advertisement Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez echoed this sentiment, and referred to the Native American \u201c code talkers \u201d who used indigenous languages to send secret messages to Allies during the war. \u201cOur words were used to help win World War II, and now we are helping to navigate and learn more about the planet Mars,\u201d Nez said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Unexpected Reason It's Healthy To Feel Shame Evolutionary psychologists explain why we sometimes get that sinking feeling of not being good enough. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 3, 2016, 11:37 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Evolutionary psychologists say that shame serves an important social function. Anetlanda via Getty Images Carl Jung, the Swiss founder of analytical psychology, called shame a \"soul-eating emotion.\" Following the Jungian model, author and shame expert Dr. Brene Brown has called the emotion the \"swamplands of the soul\" -- something that makes us see ourselves as defective and worthless. People often confuse shame with guilt, but Brown says there's an important distinction between the two: Feelings of guilt revolve around \"I did something bad,\" but shame has more to do with the feeling of \"I am bad.\" Advertisement Shame has been linked to addiction , perfectionism , depression and low self-esteem . Sounds like a pretty unproductive emotion, right? Well, new research suggests this maybe not be entirely true. Shame has evolved to serve the important function of being a social defense, according to a study published last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . This adds some nuance to the traditional belief that shame stems from a feeling of being deficient. \"We've been puzzled by these very prominent hypotheses in social psychology that shame really isn't about people's concerns over how others see them,\" Dr. Daniel Sznycer, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post. \"It didn't make sense to us that shame would be completely divorced from concerns about the evaluations of others.\" Advertisement Similar to the way pain protects us from things that hurt us physically, shame may protect us from things that threaten our social identity, the research suggests. In other words, \"the function of shame is to prevent us from damaging our social relationships, or to motivate us to repair them,\" Sznycer explained in a statement . It makes us care what others think of us, and helps to us determine the \"social cost\" of a particular behavior or action. There's a clear evolutionary advantage to securing positive relationships and being valued by others. Humans once lived in small, cooperative hunter-gatherer groups, Dr. John Tooby, an anthropologist at the university and a co-author of the study, said in the statement. Advertisement \"In this world, your life depended on others valuing you enough to give you and your children food, protection and care,\" he said. \"The more you are valued by the individuals with whom you live ... the more weight they will put on your welfare in making decisions. You will be helped more and harmed less.\" To conduct the study, researchers created 24 fictional scenarios depicting behaviors or personal traits that could lead to social devaluation, such as physical weakness, stinginess and infidelity. For each scenario, one group of participants was asked to rate how negatively they would view someone else if they performed that action or had that trait. Another group was asked how much shame they would feel if those things were true of themselves. Advertisement Participants reported devaluing themselves and others at nearly equal levels. Other emotions, like anxiety and sadness, did not have the same similarities in magnitude. Cross-cultural similarities among the 900 participants in the U.S., Israel and India revealed that shame had a similar effect in different social contexts -- reinforcing the notion that it is a universal emotional experience. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Choosing Sadness: The Irony of Depression My depressed friend wanted relief from his misery, sometimes desperately. He struggled, yet ironically, he often acted in ways that maintained -- rather than alleviated -- his misery. Apparently he's not alone in this sad choice. By Wray Herbert, Contributor Author, 'On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits' Author, 'On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind's Hard-Wired Habits' Apr 8, 2015, 08:56 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

He also lived what seemed to me a melancholy life, listening to sad, sentimental music, reading dreary existential novels, and rarely venturing out of his dark and gloomy house. I cared for this man, and I was perplexed by this. I knew that he suffered from a debilitating disease, but he also didn't seem to be taking simple steps that might lift his mood. It was almost like he was choosing sadness. This seems like an ungenerous thought, I know, but it turns out there may be some truth to it. Hebrew University psychological scientist Maya Tamir and her colleagues have been studying how people with depression regulate their emotions, and they may have an explanation for my acquaintance's paradoxical and forlorn lifestyle choices. Advertisement Emotional regulation is the process of changing one's current emotions into more desirable ones. We all do it all the time. It's well known and not all that surprising that depressed people have difficulty with emotion regulation, but Tamir believes that we have been looking at emotion dysregulation the wrong way. Specifically, we've been assuming that depression is linked to deficits in emotional regulation strategies, when in fact the problem may have to do with emotional regulation goals. The distinction between strategies and goals is crucial. Some strategies are adaptive and others not. For example, cognitive reappraisal is a healthy strategy for most people, one that involves rethinking and changing the meaning of situations so that they generate different emotions. Situation selection -- choosing positive stimuli like movies and music -- is another. Rumination, very common in depression, is an example of a maladaptive regulation strategy. There is some evidence that depressed people use maladaptive strategies, but Tamir thinks that focusing on the effectiveness of emotional regulation may be missing the point. The problem may be more basic. It may instead be that depressed people are choosing the wrong emotion regulation goal to begin with. That is, depressed people may be effective enough in regulating their emotions, but they may be choosing to regulate in a direction that reinforces their negative mood. This raises the possibility that depressed people are actually more motivated to experience unpleasant emotions like sadness, as strange as this sounds. Advertisement Tamir and her colleagues tested this provocative idea is a few experiments. In one, for example, they asked depressed and healthy subjects to choose between looking at sad pictures or amusing ones (or neutral ones). So all the subjects were using the same stimuli selection strategy, but the depressed subjects still chose significantly more of the sad images -- even though they clearly had the option of avoiding them. In a second similar study, subjects chose music, and again depressed subjects chose to listen to sad tunes more often than healthy controls did, even when upbeat music was available. Finally, even when depressed subjects were explicitly trained to reappraise situations in more positive ways, they chose not to use the strategy as often as healthy controls. So across studies, as reported in a forthcoming issue of the journal Psychological Science , depressed subjects clearly chose to engage with stimuli that caused them moderate to intense sadness. The findings show that depressed individuals, compared with healthy controls, regulate their emotions in a manner that is likely to maintain sadness. But they did not choose to decrease happiness. They chose more happy images than sad images, and what's more, they said they preferred happiness to sadness. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So why, if they prefer happiness, would they deliberately choose regulatory goals that undermine that happiness? One possibility, the scientists say, is that depressed people use emotion regulation to verify their emotional selves. In other words, sadness is more familiar to depressed people, so they are motivated to experience sadness as a way of reaffirming who they are. Depression is also closely tied to low self-esteem, and it may be that depressed people believe that they deserve to feel bad.

Could You Outrun A Fart? Here's What The Science Says Usain Bolt has his work cut out for him. By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Apr 13, 2016, 02:33 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT You can run but you can't hide. When a fart detonates, you face a difficult race to avoid its impact, according to a new video (above) that was released by the YouTube series AsapScience on Wednesday. Escaping the sound is out of the question. At around 340 meters per second , the sound can travel hundreds of meters per second faster than Olympic sprint champ Usain Bolt, according to the video. But as for your chances of beating the stink, well, you can try. Advertisement According to the new video, the stinky emissions in the farts can be quite swift. Skatole, one of the rank compounds found in a fart, can speed through the air with intimidating velocity under certain conditions. \"If we use the kinetic theory of gases, assume that the fart is at body temperature, and then we plug in the molar mass of skatole, we calculate that the smelliest skatole may be traveling around 243 meters per second,\" Mitchell Moffit, narrator and co-creator of the series, says in the video. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What Makes Fireflies Light Up? Here's The Whole Story This research has implications beyond the bugs' butts, too. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Aug 3, 2015, 09:03 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT What makes fireflies light up? We've long known the key is a chemical reaction involving a molecule known as luciferase. But it turns out that's only part of the story. And now we know the rest, thanks to new research by a chemist at Connecticut College. Dr. Bruce Branchini replicated the reaction in a laboratory setting for the first time ever, confirming what others had hypothesized: that it takes a charged particle called superoxide to create the bugs' beloved bioluminescence. Just check out the video above, describing the research. Advertisement American Chemical Society \"The key experiment involved the use of a special instrument that uses a magnet and microwaves,\" Branchini told The Huffington Post in an email. \"With this equipment we definitively identified superoxide ion in a reaction just like the one fireflies use to produce light.\" Case closed. But Dr. Branchini said the finding could open the door to new avenues of cancer research. \"We hope that our work will lead to the development of bioluminescence methods with greater sensitivity leading to improved detection of cancerous cells,\" he said in the email.

World's Atmospheric CO2 Spiked To A Record Last Year: UN \"Wake up world. We are killing our planet.\" By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Oct 31, 2017, 07:07 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A grim United Nations agency report reiterates a warning that climate scientists have been touting for months: At the rate we\u2019re going, it\u2019ll be near-impossible for the world to meet Paris climate targets unless drastic action to curb greenhouse gas emissions is taken swiftly. The World Meteorological Organization\u2019s annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin , published Monday, describes how concentrations of global atmospheric carbon dioxide increased at a record rate in 2016 \u2014 reaching the highest level in 800,000 years of observable data. Advertisement \u201cGlobally averaged concentrations of CO2 reached 403.3 parts per million in 2016, up from 400.00 ppm in 2015 because of a combination of human activities and a strong El Ni\u00f1o event,\u201d the organization says. \u201cConcentrations of CO2 are now 145 percent of pre-industrial (before 1750) levels.\u201d Greenhouse Gas Bulletin: atmospheric levels of CO2 surged at a record speed in 2016 to 403.33 ppm in 2016 because of #ElNi\u00f1o , #ClimateChange pic.twitter.com/kJDyNaWtXV \u2014 WMO | OMM (@WMO) October 30, 2017 The 3.3 ppm bump is significantly higher than the average annual increase over the past decade of 2.08 ppm , noted The Guardian, adding that the rise was also \u201cwell above the previous big El Ni\u00f1o year of 1998,\u201d when CO2 concentration rose by 2.7 ppm. Advertisement \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of U.N. Environment, in a statement. \u201cWhat we need now is global political will and a new sense of urgency.\u201d CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere hit new high in 2016 because of #ElNi\u00f1o & #climatechange , even though new emissions are levelling out pic.twitter.com/U0EAQmkVOF \u2014 WMO | OMM (@WMO) October 30, 2017 CO2 emissions from human sources have slowed in recent years \u2014 but carbon dioxide lingers and continues to accumulate in the atmosphere for centuries, so the concentration of the greenhouse gas has continued to balloon, according to the World Meteorological Organization report. CO2 has been the primary driver of climate change since the Industrial Revolution. Advertisement Gavin Schmidt, NASA\u2019s chief climate scientist, explained to Climate Central last year that even if CO2 emissions somehow plunged to zero tomorrow, the level of carbon dioxide \u201c probably wouldn\u2019t change much \u201d and would only start to fall \u201cin a decade or so.\u201d Recent studies have suggested that humans need to do more to slash the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as the ability of natural carbon sinks to slurp up CO2 weakens. Studies have shown that carbon sinks, like oceans and the biosphere, may lose their efficacy in absorbing CO2 as temperatures rise . There\u2019s also evidence suggesting that forests are being destroyed at such a rapid pace that they may be emitting more carbon dioxide than they mitigate . \u201cWithout rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions, we will be heading for dangerous temperature increases by the end of this century, well above the target set by the Paris climate change agreement,\u201d World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a statement. \u201cFuture generations will inherit a much more inhospitable planet.\u201d Advertisement The report was published in the days leading up to COP23, the U.N. climate change conference scheduled to take place in Bonn, Germany, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 17. Reacting to report on Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres did not mince words: The @WMO report sends an urgent message: Wake up world. We are killing our planet.

Tiny Quantum Dots May Spell Doom For Deadly Superbug Infections Scientists say the light-activated nanoparticles wipe out infectious bacteria without harming healthy cells By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jan 20, 2016, 02:49 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. iLexx via Getty Images Does nanotechnology hold the key to stopping antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the deadly infections they cause? Scientists in Colorado think it just might. They've developed light-activated nanoparticles -- each roughly 20,000 times smaller than the thickness of a single human hair -- and shown in lab tests that these \"quantum dots\" are more than 90 percent effective at wiping out antibiotic-resistant germs like Salmonella, E. coli and Staphylococcus. Advertisement \"In our study, we tailored these quantum dots so they can selectively kill these 'superbugs' without affecting other host mammalian cells (or human cells),\" Dr. Prashant Nagpal , assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder and a leader of the research, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"This means, after more careful clinical trials, we can simply administer these dots to patients with infections and it can cure the infection without potential effects (or side effects) for healthy host cells.\" If Nagpal is right, that would be a very big deal. Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, fueled in part by doctors' improper use of common antibiotics, represent an enormous public health problem. In the U.S. alone, infections caused by germs that can't be eradicated with antibiotics sicken 2 million people and cause at least 23,000 deaths a year. And new, more effective antibiotics have proven very hard to develop. (Story continues below image.) High-resolution electron micrograph of a cadmium telluride nanoparticle. Scale bar is 2 nanometers. courtesy Dr. Prashant Nagpal Advertisement Previous research on nanoparticles showed that those made of metals like gold and silver can be harmful to healthy tissue as well as the target bacteria, according to a written statement released by the university. But that kind of collateral damage doesn't seem to be a problem with the new quantum dots. Made of semiconducting materials like cadmium telluride instead of metal, they can be tailored to specific infections, slipping inside the disease-causing germs and, when activated by light, triggering chemical reactions that destroy them. \"We don't use any special light, and a typical weak light source (a lamp, well-lighted room, sunlight, etc.) is enough to activate these quantum dots,\" Nagpal said in the email. Advertisement Nagpal foresees several applications for quantum dots, depending on the nature of the infection. Infected cuts might simply be covered with nanoparticle-impregnated bandages. Patients with systemic infections might receive injections of quantum dots. In addition, hospital rooms and medical instruments might be treated with a dot-containing disinfectant in order to reduce the risk of spreading infections from patient to patient. But more research, including clinical trials, will be needed to develop quantum dot therapy and prove its safety and effectiveness in humans. Nagpal said he was seeking funding from federal agencies or private donors to make that happen. Advertisement Once tested, there is a chance that bacteria might adapt to the therapy. But even so, Nagpal said, it should be easy to then tune nanoparticles to \"keep up in this evolutionary race\" between bacteria and measures to eradicate them. A paper describing the research was published online on Monday in the journal Nature Materials.

Congress Gets Another Reminder From Scientists That Climate Change Isn't Coming -- It's Already Here \"We owe it to our children and to our children's children to take bold action now so that our descendants do not pay the price for our generation's greed.\" By Kim Bellware Reporter, HuffPost Jun 28, 2016, 01:26 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The severity of climate change is already harming the global economy, natural resources and human health -- and it will only get worse in the coming decades, say leading U.S. policymakers and scientific organizations in a letter they sent to Congress on Tuesday. Scientific groups are asking lawmakers to address the threats posed by climate change by taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. shutterstock \"Climate change is real and happening now, and the United States urgently needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Rush Holt, the CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and publisher of the Science group of journals. Advertisement \"We must not delay, ignore the evidence, or be fearful of the challenge,\" Holt said. \"America has provided global leadership to successfully confront many environmental problems, from acid rain to the ozone hole, and we can do it again. We owe no less to future generations.\" The letter urges Congress to take action to substantially reduce greenhouse gases, highlighting disasters caused by climate change that have already affected the U.S., including drought , heat waves, wildfires and rising sea levels. A projection of what present-day Boston would look like under 10 to 20 feet of water, based on the estimated sea level rise last time carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are now (some 3 million years ago). Climate Central Advertisement A failure to take action could threaten everything from our food supply to our national security, stated retired U.S. Naval Rear Admiral Jonathan White, who is now CEO of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership. Man-made climate change is \"not a matter of opinion, but of careful evaluation of data from a vast spectrum of scientific disciplines,\" added Anne Yoder, president of the Society of Systematic Biologists, in a statement. \"What remains unclear is the degree to which climate change will cause environmental, social, and economic havoc,\" Yoder said. \"Estimates range from severe to catastrophic. We owe it to our children and to our children's children to take bold action now so that our descendants do not pay the price for our generation's greed.\" Advertisement \u201cMan-made climate change is \"not a matter of opinion, but of careful evaluation of data from a vast spectrum of scientific disciplines.\"\u201d - Anne Yoder, Society of Systematic Biologists Some of the nation's top nonpartisan scientific groups, including the American Chemical Society, the American Meteorological Society and the American Public Health Association, signed Tuesday's letter. A number of the groups sent a similar plea to lawmakers in 2009, imploring them to take the threat of climate change seriously and take meaningful action to stop it. Advertisement Since 2009, lawmakers have proposed more than 800 pieces of legislation related to climate change . The vast majority have failed, with votes largely falling along partisan lines in the Republican-controlled Congress. Read the full letter to Congress below.

Yes, I know the current push by our Federal Space Agency on social media is #JourneytoMars, but are we ready?ready? Nope, I don't think we're even close. By Clayton Anderson, Contributor U.S. Astronaut (Ret.); Author of The Ordinary Spaceman; ISS and Space Shuttle spacewalker; Aquanaut U.S. Astronaut (Ret.); Author of The Ordinary Spaceman; ISS and Space Shuttle spacewalker; Aquanaut Apr 6, 2015, 05:25 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Did you know that \"Fly Me to the Moon\", a popular song written in 1954 by Bart Howard, was originally titled \"In Other Words\"? First recorded by Kaye Ballard in 1954, most of those in my demographic more readily recognize Frank Sinatra's 1964 version, which was closely associated with the Apollo missions to the Moon. So... who knew Frank Sinatra was a rocket scientist?! Sinatra's 1964 recorded version, played on the Apollo 10 mission -- which orbited the Moon -- was also the first music ever heard on the Moon when it resonated throughout a tiny three-person space capsule via a portable cassette player ( Google it!) used by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin after he stepped onto the lunar surface way back in 1969. This is the song that NASA should be singing right now. Yes, I know the current push by our Federal Space Agency on social media is #JourneytoMars, but are we ready? Really ready? Nope, I don't think we're even close. Advertisement Most agree that Mars is the ultimate destination. And so do I. Theorists laud its \"in situ\" capabilities, with NASA Ames Research Center claiming (circa 2007) that \"... in-situ resource utilization will enable the affordable establishment of extraterrestrial exploration and operations by minimizing the materials carried from Earth.\" Maybe so. The thin oxygen, nitrogen, argon and carbon rich atmosphere and the planet's Curiosity rover track-laden rusty red surface are full of needed sustenance. Through the use of properly developed, new technologies, we can extract --among other things -- the oxygen and hydrogen, needed to provide us with the necessary components leading to life support, propellants, construction materials, and energy. All this is well and good. But how do we do it? How do we process these wonderful life-sustaining elements to make our reality begin to look like the solar-powered, potato-rich, inflatable habitat reality experienced by fictional Astronaut Mark Watney in Andy Weir's highly acclaimed novel The Martian ? We need companies like Caterpillar, Inc., John Deere, Ditch Witch and The Culligan Man to lead the way. Partnerships relying on these stalwart corporations would truly be space commercialization at its finest. And what better place to enable and test the development of all this needed technology than the Moon? A mere three day's journey away, the travel route is on known and proven trajectories. Communication delays are minimal and we are close enough to \"correct\" process and design flaws while maintaining needed rescue capability as we learn what is truly required to launch a viable --and sustainable -- human expedition to Mars. Advertisement I hope what I'm hearing is true -- that leadership might be starting to position the storied space agency for a possible shift in our Red Planet \"destinational pathway.\" So \"In Other Words,\" c'mon NASA, the time is now -- \"Fly Me to the Moon\"! After all, isn't that the best way for us to \"... see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars?!\" http://bit.ly/AstroClayPreOrder Go to Homepage Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

For Some Cancers, Experts Increasingly Favor A 'Wait And See' Approach To Treatment Recent studies have shown that doctors may be overdiagnosing, and overtreating, some types of cancer. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Sep 11, 2015, 07:29 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT bojan fatur via Getty Images Thyroid cancer rates are skyrocketing . In 1992, 5.9 in 100,000 Americans were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and in 2002, 9.2 in 100,000 got the diagnosis. By 2012, the most recent year for which data are available, the rate has risen to a whopping 14.9 -- two and a half times as high as it was just two decades before. But the percentage of Americans who die of cancer in the thyroid -- a butterfly-shaped hormone gland in the neck -- hasn't budged a bit since 1992. Indeed, it's virtually the same as it was as far back as 1935 . Advertisement According to a study published this week in journal Thyroid, that's because the entire increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses is the result of more effective screening methods, not more cancer. Modern diagnostic methods, such as MRIs, CT scans and ultrasound-guided biopsies, allow doctors to detect thyroid tumors -- especially small ones -- far more easily than they could before. Yet the study noted that the small, slow-growing tumors that doctors are now able to catch aren't actually life-threatening. Indeed, they often don't cause any symptoms at all. But isn't knowing about them better than staying in the dark? Not necessarily. Because when screening picks up a growth, patients and doctors often move to treat it with surgery -- even if doing so wouldn't help the patient's health, and can actually hurt it. Advertisement For that reason, Mayo Clinic endocrinologist Dr. Juan Brito Campana, the lead author on the Thryoid study, said in an email, \"There is absolutely no evidence that screening for thyroid cancer provides any benefit to the patients.\" Unnecessary thyroidectomies always cost money -- money that could be better spent elsewhere. The researchers noted that Americans spend a total of $1.6 billion a year on thyroid cancer treatment, and that being diagnosed with thyroid cancer increases a person's risk for bankruptcy by a factor of 2.5. But more importantly, unnecessary treatments also endanger patients' health. Anyone who has their thyroid removed must take hormones to replace those produced by the thyroid for the rest of their life. And as with any surgery -- especially one in as sensitive an area as the throat -- there are risks of complications. Advertisement Thyroid cancer is just one of a number of types of cancer that some experts say is being overdiagnosed and overtreated, to the detriment of both individual patients and the health care system as whole. Though early detection and treatment are crucial for aggressive cancers, such as those of the lungs, liver and pancreas, there's growing consensus that our approach to less aggressive cancers is flawed. Most experts now agree that women should not be screened for ovarian cancer in the absence of symptoms of the disease. They have long cast doubt on the benefits of routine mammography and prostate cancer screening . And this summer, a major study of so-called \"Stage 0\" breast cancer -- formally called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS -- made front-page news for its finding that treating this condition doesn't reduce breast cancer death rates at all. Though the specifics vary from cancer to cancer, the basic principle of the argument against screening is that the harms often outweigh the benefits. Advertisement \"Each individual person who is a missed diagnosis is a tragedy,\" explained bioethicist Dr. Robin Fiore of the University of Miami. \"But every individual person who has unnecessary surgery is a tragedy as well. And in some types of cancer, there are more of the latter than the former.\" Not everyone agrees, though. Dr. Therese Bevers, a professor of clinical cancer prevention at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, for example, thinks that in cases where the benefits and harms of screening are close to even, the emphasis should be on reducing the harms of screening, not getting rid of it altogether. \"My concern is that we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater,\" she said. \"Screening isn\u2019t a bad thing as long as we aren\u2019t treating thing that don\u2019t need to be treated.\" Advertisement Many experts point to the recent experience with prostate cancer as a model for approaching this issue. In the early '90s, prostate cancer rates soared as doctors started testing many men over the age of 40 for a biomarker of the cancer, the prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, in their blood. Doctors responded by ramping up treatment, administering more radiation and removing more prostates, both of which can lead to serious side effects. But prostate cancer often grows so slowly that a large share of men with the disease often die of another condition before it becomes a problem. For that reason, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force recommended in 2012 that doctors stop screening most men for PSA . Screening rates have fallen modestly since then . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

But doctors -- even before the governmental screening recommendation -- also shifted to a different approach to prostate cancer that is often called \"active surveillance.\" Dr. Ashutosh Tewari, chairman of urology at Mt. Sinai Health System in New York, explained that new diagnostic tools allow doctors to monitor the progression of prostate cancer very accurately, so that they can begin treatment only when -- and if -- it starts to endanger a patient's health. Advertisement \"In patients on active surveillance, we do frequent imaging and genomic analysis on biopsies of the prostate, which can tell us if the cancer is low risk or high risk,\" he explained. \"And we've found that in between 50 and 70 percent of patients, the cancer remains indolent.\" That means that a huge share of men diagnosed with prostate cancer never get treatment -- and that's a good thing.

'Ice Age' Fossils Found In California Construction Site Mammoths, bisons and turtles \u2014 oh my! By Michael McLaughlin Reporter, HuffPost Sep 8, 2015, 08:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Cornerstone Communities A huge array of ice age fossils, including the bones of mammoths, turtles and horses, were uncovered at a Southern California construction site this summer. The fossils found in Carlsbad, California, are 50,000 to 200,000 years old. That dates from the Pleistocene Epoch , a period that included the last ice age. Advertisement The discovery delayed construction on more than 600 homes by Cornerstone Communities as paleontologists scour the 60-acre project site. Cornerstone Communities A photo posted Friday on the company's Facebook page shows workers in hard hats excavating a large bone encased in dirt. Advertisement The haul includes the partial remains of a prehistoric bison, which were carted away to the San Diego Natural History Museum for display. There are also parts of skeletons from two Columbian mammoths; the animals, larger than woolly mammoths, could grow to be 13 feet tall at the shoulders and could weigh up to 10 tons . \u201cThey are direct connections with the past, an ancient ecosystem that was once common here. We can understand how climates can change by studying these ancient ecosystems,\u201d Tom Dem\u00e9r\u00e9, curator of paleontology at the San Diego Natural History Museum, told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Researchers Find Second U.S. Patient Infected With 'Superbug' Gene The mcr-1 gene makes bacteria highly resistant to the last-resort antibiotic called colistin, which is used to treat multi-drug-resistant infections. Reuters Jun 27, 2016, 04:35 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists, like Dr. Patrick McGann, left, and Kathy 'Ana' Ong, have been testing bacteria for the antibiotic-resistant mcr-1 gene since it was discovered last year in China. The Washington Post via Getty Images Scientists have identified a second patient in the United States infected with bacteria carrying the mcr-1 \"superbug\" gene, which makes bacteria highly resistant to a last-resort class of antibiotics. The gene, found in a sample of E. coli bacteria from a patient in New York, follows the discovery late last month of a patient in Pennsylvania who had a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli that carried the gene. Advertisement The finding was published on Monday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology. The mcr-1 gene makes bacteria resistant to colistin, an antibiotic used to treat multi-drug-resistant infections, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CRE, which U.S. health officials have dubbed a \"nightmare\" bacteria. Dr. McGann, pictured, is seen checking a DNA sampling at the Walter Reed annex in Silver Spring, Maryland in late May. The Washington Post via Getty Images Advertisement What is concerning about the mcr-1 gene discoveries in the United States is that bacteria have the capability to share resistance genes. U.S. officials are worried that the mcr-1 gene may find its way into CRE bacteria, potentially creating bacteria resistant to virtually all types of antibiotics. Scientists have been tracking the mcr-1 gene's movement around the globe since it was discovered last year in people and pigs in China. The latest U.S. finding of mcr-1 came as part of a global effort called the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, led by Mariana Castanheira of JMI Laboratories based in North Liberty, Iowa. Advertisement Researchers tested 13,525 Escherichia coli and 7,481 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from patients collected last year from hospitals in the Asia-Pacific region, Latin America, Europe and North America. Colonies of E. coli bacteria are seen. In May, U.S. health officials reported the first case in the country of a patient with E. coli bacteria carrying the mcr-1 gene. Handout . / Reuters Of these, 390, or 1.9 percent, were resistant to colistin, and 19 of these isolates tested positive for the mcr-1 gene. Advertisement Samples carrying the gene came from 10 countries and included some from each region. Only one came from the United States. It involved a New York patient infected with E. coli whose name and condition were not disclosed. In both U.S. cases, bacteria that carried the \"superbug\" gene were resistant to colistin but susceptible to a number of other antibiotics, making the infections treatable. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
