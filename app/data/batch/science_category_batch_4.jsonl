New Continent Zealandia Is Discovered Underwater The earth's eighth continent is believed a piece of the ancient super-continent Gondwana. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Feb 17, 2017, 10:00 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Hail, Zealandia! It\u2019s not the lost city of Atlantis, but scientists say they\u2019re convinced they have discovered the planet\u2019s eighth continent sprawling underwater beneath New Zealand. Australia and adjacent New Zealand have always been considered the continent of Australia. But now, researchers have found that New Zealand rests on a separate 1.8 million-square-mile continental crust, rather than oceanic crust. Advertisement The continent, dubbed Zealandia, also includes New Caledonia and other islands and territories in that section of the southwest Pacific Ocean, according to a paper published this week by the Geological Society of America. It\u2019s about two-thirds the size of the country of Australia, and 94 percent is underwater. \u201cIts isolation from Australia and large area support its definition as a continent\u2014Zealandia,\u201d wrote researchers from universities in Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. \u201cThe identification of Zealandia as a geological continent, rather than a collection of continental islands, fragments, and slices, more correctly represents the geology of this part of Earth ... [and] provides a fresh context in which to investigate processes of continental rifting, thinning, and breakup,\u201d the authors wrote. Advertisement Scientists have postulated for more than a decade that New Zealand and outlying islands comprise a separate continent, or microcontinent. But information demonstrating that Zealandia is a distinctly separate and contiguous mass merits its elevation to the status of continent, they\u2019ve concluded. Researchers say Zealandia is part of an enormous ancient super-continent \u2014 Gondwana or Gondwanaland \u2014 that once included Australia and much of the remaining Southern Hemisphere. Gondwana broke apart some 180 million years ago , with some pieces eventually sinking. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA's 9/11 Memorial On Mars Is Simply Out Of This World It's located 140 million miles from New York City. By Rebecca Shapiro Senior Editor, HuffPost Sep 12, 2016, 12:45 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT As the U.S. commemorated the 15-year anniversary of the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks, NASA shared a tribute in a place far beyond America\u2019s borders. NASA shared a photo on Facebook Sunday that showed the Mars Exploration Rover Mission\u2019s memorial to the victims of the Sept. 11th attacks on the World Trade Center. Advertisement The photo was originally taken and shared with the world on Sept. 11, 2011, during the 10-year anniversary of the attacks. The memorial, located on the abrasion tool on the Opportunity rover, is an image of the American flag on a cable guard made of aluminum recovered from Ground Zero. Back in 2001, workers at Honeybee Robotics, which was located less than a mile from the World Trade Center, built the rover\u2019s rock abrasion tool.

Here's How To Watch The Geminid Meteor Shower As long as it's not cloudy. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Dec 13, 2015, 07:21 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Look up to the sky if you want to see a spectacular display of shooting stars on Sunday night. The Geminid meteor shower , named so because the meteors appear as if they're coming from the Gemini constellation, lasts until Thursday, according to NASA. But it will hit its peak Sunday night through Monday morning, CNN reported, with 120 meteors -- small pieces of debris from asteroid 3200 Phaethon -- crashing into the Earth's atmosphere every hour. Advertisement The Geminid meteor shower peaks this weekend starting on Dec. 13. Here are a few fun facts: https://t.co/dkn7aD14MQ pic.twitter.com/lP7KnhTq9F \u2014 NASA (@NASA) December 11, 2015 Everyone around the world , in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, has the opportunity to see them, according to the International Meteor Organization. \"Near-peak Geminid rates usually persist for almost a day though, so much of the world has the chance to enjoy something of the shower's best, regardless of when the maximum actually happens,\" the organization said on its 2015 Meteor Shower Calendar. Advertisement An incredible picture taken from the Mojave Desert area shows a huge meteor hurtling to earth during the annual Geminid meteor shower on Dec. 14, 2009. Barcroft via Getty Images The moon will be barely visible and is expected to set early in the night, Gizmodo reported, meaning it will be perfect conditions to see the shower from around 9 p.m. -- as long as it's not cloudy. As with viewing all meteor showers, no special equipment is needed. Sky gazers just need to find an unobstructed spot with no glaring lights nearby, Time magazine suggested.

Polar Bear Cub Sleeps And Dreams With Cuddly Toy In Adorable Clip Captivating video shows the 5-week-old stretching out and making cute noises. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Dec 12, 2015, 02:52 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT This adorable polar bear cub just couldn't get to sleep without her cuddly toy. The 5-week-old was caught on camera snuggling into the plaything inside a crib at Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Powell, Ohio, earlier this week. Video uploaded to Facebook and YouTube by the zoo on Friday shows her stretching out, making cute noises and twitching as she appears to dream . Advertisement The cub, who has born on Nov. 6 and has not yet been named, currently weighs just 4 pounds and is 16 inches long, according to the Facebook post. \"Both eyes have started to open as of yesterday, but they are not fully open yet,\" the post stated, adding that she is fed every four hours. Advertisement \"The care staff says the sound that she makes in the video is of contentment. Her motor skills are improving each day and she has started trying to stand up on all fours, especially when she\u2019s ready for her next meal!\" the zoo said. A previous Facebook post detailed that the zoo's animal care staff is hand-rearing the cub after her mother, Aurora, stopped caring for her . Advertisement In the wild, polar bears are found in the U.S., Canada, Russia, Greenland and Norway, and do not live in the Southern Hemisphere , according to the zoo\u2019s website.

Strange New World: Scientists Create Human-Pig Embryos The experiment is an early step in growing human organs. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jan 26, 2017, 11:28 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING In a chilling experiment seemingly out of science fiction, scientists created two human-pig embryos \u2014 then destroyed them after a few weeks of growth. The creations included human stem cells grown inside pig embryos, with the cells constituting only a small part of the embryos. The scientists\u2019 hope is that such recombinations could be used to grow replacement organs for humans that wouldn\u2019t be rejected by the recipient\u2019s body. Advertisement The controversial experiment was conducted in California and Spain, and paid for by private foundations. The U.S. suspended taxpayer funding for such animal-human combinations in 2015. The possibility of growing human organs in pig embryos is still \u201c far away ,\u201d researcher Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte of the Salk Institute in California said of the experiment in the journal Cell, in an article published Thursday. He called the work \u201cjust a very early step toward the goal.\u201d Such work presents incredible challenges. \u201cSpecies evolve independently, and many factors dictating the developmental programs might have diverged , which makes it difficult to blend cells from one species to a developing embryo from another,\u201d Dr. Jun Wu told CNN . \u201cThe larger the evolutionary distance, the more difficult for them to mix.\u201d Advertisement Animals with cells from different species are called chimeras. Such combinations had been successfully created earlier with mice and rats, but larger animals like pigs would be needed to make human-sized organs. That could help ease the shortage of human donors for transplants. A sick person is added every 10 minutes somewhere in the world to a waiting list for an organ, and each day 22 people on the list die for lack of an organ, according to statistics. The Salk team is working on making human-friendly pancreases, hearts and livers in pigs. The animals would grow the organs in place of their own, and then would be euthanized before the organ is removed. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Will NASA Really Take Humans to Mars in the 2030s Like <i>The Martian</i> Movie? We have only existed a short time on this planet, and we know other species, such as the dinosaurs, did not survive due to planetary changes. That makes the study of other planets, and the ability to travel to them, crucial to the future of human existence. By Alejandro Rojas, Contributor Writer, blogger, video and podcast host.

Last week, I participated in a press event at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston promoting the DVD and Blu-ray release of The Martian movie. We spoke with several NASA officials and an astronaut about their plans to take humans to Mars. They all shared with us the significant challenges ahead in order to accomplish that goal. However, it is a goal they take seriously and are determined to achieve. The Martian poster with astronaut Gus Grissom's space suit on display in the background at NASA's Johnson Space Center.

He is hurt during a storm that requires the crew to return to their orbiting spacecraft, and he's left on the surface, presumed dead. Advertisement He actually isn't dead and wakes up stranded on Mars. He doesn't have the supplies to live long enough to survive on the planet for the length of time it will take for his friends at NASA to come back and get him, so, in his words, \"I'm left with only one option, I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this.\" In an interview in the auditorium at Space Center Houston, The Martian producer Aditya Sood told us the experience of working on the movie with NASA employees was amazing. He said he enjoyed \"interacting with folks who literally science the shit out of things every day.\" The Martian producer Aditya Sood at NASA's Johnson Space Center, December 3, 2015. Credit: Alejandro Rojas. Advertisement I got an idea of what Sood was talking about when we interviewed some of the scientists responsible for getting humans to Mars. They really are going to have to science the shit out of it in order to accomplish their ambitious goal of making that happen in the 2030s. Planetary Science Division Director Jim Green told us in a Q and A that getting humans on the surface of Mars in 2035 is probably too ambitious. They are actually looking to get a \"human presence in the neighborhood\" by the 2030s, meaning in Mars' orbit. Their goal for getting boots on the ground on Mars is the 2040s or 50s.

Advertisement The spacecraft that will take humans to Mars will be the Orion . It is not quite as futuristic-looking as the spaceship in The Martian . In fact, The Orion looks more like the spacecraft that took us to the moon. However, according to their website, \"NASA's Orion spacecraft is built to take humans farther than they've ever gone before.\" Manager, Mechanical, Pyrotechnic, Landing and Recovery Systems Stu McClung with a mockup Orion crew module at the Johnson Space Center Space Vehicle Mockup Facility, December 3, 2015. Credit: Alejandro Rojas. Advertisement When asked if they will really be ready to go to Mars in the 2030s, Stu McClung, the manager of Mechanical, Pyrotechnic, Landing and Recover Systems, who has worked at Johnson Space Center in the Orion Crew/Service Module Office since 2006, told us with confidence and pride, \"My capsule will be ready!\" Although, he did make that statement with a bit of a wry smile. That is because he admits they still have a lot to figure out. Some of the challenges they face include, how to communicate with crew members in deep space, developing lighter radiation shielding, and where to store all of the food the astronauts will need.

Credit: Alejandro Rojas. Advertisement When it comes to food, where to store it is not the only thing they need to figure out, according to Vickie Kloeris, manager of the International Space Station (ISS) Food System. Currently, the ISS holds about six months of food storage. And, especially with the quick turnaround of some of the commercial space resupply missions, astronauts are able to enjoy fresh foods, such as fruits and vegetables. This will not be the case when it comes to long duration flights. A trip to Mars would have a round trip time anywhere from 245 to 450 days. According to Kloeris, the food has a long shelf life, and would be safe to eat, but we are not sure what the effects of radiation or microgravity would be on the state of the food. It might be rendered unpalatable. Manager, International Space Station Food System Vickie Kloeris addresses the press at Johnson Space Center, December 3, 2015. Credit: Alejandro Rojas. Advertisement There is also a possibility, Kloeris suggests, that spaceflight has an effect on flavor receptors. There is currently anecdotal information that this. However, according to Kloeris, they have not been able to prove this in testing, nor have they been able to determine what might be the cause. For instance, Kloeris adds, the effect on flavor could be due to aroma. Perhaps on the ISS the heat from the food does not cause the aroma to float up to the astronauts' nose as it does here on Earth. Or perhaps the other aromas in the ISS affect the astronauts' ability to taste. On the Q and A website Quora , Astronaut Clayton Anderson wrote about the smell on the ISS. He says the ISS air purification systems work very well, and gives them a \"significantly 'odor-free' environment.\" However, according to Anderson, there is a smell to space. He writes: \"Ever distinct -- I would know it instantly if I smelled it -- it has been likened to smells associated with welding or burning of ozone (now, who the heck really knows what that smells like?!). Most noticeable following a spacewalk, when crews and their equipment returned to the inside of the ISS, I remember being able to smell traces of this unique scent for several days following an excursion into the unforgiving vacuum of space.\" Advertisement Even with all of the challenges outlined above, as in The Martian movie, NASA scientists are busting their humps to accomplish their lofty Martian goals. NASA Astronaut Dr. Drew Feustel at Johnson Space Center, December 3, 2015. Credit: Alejandro Rojas. Astronaut Drew Feustel told me that, although he might be able to fly on an Orion mission, he is probably too old to be one of the astronauts to go to Mars. However, he believes the mission to Mars is vital for the survival of the human species. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These Retired Lab Chimps Are Already Loving Their New Home \"There were hugs and kisses and grooming.\" By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Sep 10, 2016, 03:52 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Nine former lab chimpanzees are settling into their new home at a Georgia sanctuary \u2015 with more than 200 others slated to join them. Project Chimps , a 236-acre facility near Blue Ridge, Georgia, welcomed Buttercup, Charisse, Emma, Genesis, Gertrude, Gracie, Jennifer, Latricia and Samira on Thursday. The all-female crew, ranging from 10 to 12 years of age, came from the University of Louisiana\u2019s New Iberia Research Center. They resided there with 211 others, though the university states that the majority of chimps were housed but never actually used for research . Advertisement After the 600-mile journey in transfer cages, the chimps seemed thrilled to reunite on the sanctuary\u2019s \u201cparty porch,\u201d an outdoor porch area decorated in honor of their arrival, said primatologist and Project Chimps president Sarah Baeckler Davis. \u201cAs each individual joined the group, there were hugs and kisses and grooming- they seemed so happy to be together again,\u201d she told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cOne of the girls climbed all the way to the top and stared out at the surrounding mountain forest.\u201d Advertisement The chimps will live in social groups and have access to forested outdoor space, as well as enrichment like toys and puzzles. Project Chimps has an agreement with New Iberia to take all the chimps from the facility. They currently have the capacity to house about 80 chimps, according to Popular Science , but Baeckler Davis said they are continuing to build and will ultimately be able to house up to 300. She noted that the chimps did have indoor and outdoor access at their former home. But at the sanctuary, she said, they will be in a facility that is devoted entirely to their well-being. \u201c[O]ur sole purpose is to provide care to the chimps and give them choices on what they would like to eat, who they would like to spend time with, what toys they\u2019d like to play with, etc.,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter quarantine, they will also have the ability to go out into the open-top enclosed space to spend time under the trees and foraging through grass. We really can\u2019t wait for that moment.\u201d Advertisement The group admits that life in captivity of any form \u2014 even at a well-run sanctuary \u2014 isn\u2019t as ideal as life in the wild, but chimpanzees used to living in the lab simply lack the survival skills to live in the wild totally on their own. Research on chimpanzees in the United States has been winding down for several years, a trend spurred by animal advocates and conservationists. Advertisement In June 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service granted endangered species status to captive chimps \u2014 a designation that previously only applied to wild chimps. The decision prohibited most invasive research on chimps , with exceptions for research that would \u201cbenefit the species in the wild\u201d or aid in conservation tactics, Nature.com reported at the time. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health had been phasing out biomedical research on chimps since 2013. They announced in November 2015 that they would cease all support for any research on chimps and retire the last 50 animals they had been holding in reserve for future research. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The NIH has no affiliation with the chimps being transferred to Project Chimps, according to the sanctuary. Former NIH chimps are being transferred to Chimp Haven , a federally funded sanctuary in Louisiana, though the process of moving all the chimps from NIH labs has come under fire for being slow. The institute announced in 2013 that they would start retiring hundreds of NIH-owned or supported chimps to Chimp Haven \u2015 but nearly 400 still remained in the labs as of January 2016, the Washington Post reported.

This New Technology May Hold Clues To Stopping Viruses It tracks the way that viruses assemble. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Dec 9, 2015, 11:44 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Viruses can spontaneously self-assemble in large numbers, but how exactly they assemble has left scientists scratching their heads. Now, an international team of researchers has developed a new way to closely observe viruses in hopes that better understanding their self-assembling skills may lead to the engineering of new treatments, according to a video (above) released by the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences on Monday. Advertisement \"Viral infection involves many complex molecular and cellular pathways, but self-assembly is a process that is found in many different viruses ,\" Dr. Vinothan Manoharan, professor of chemical engineering and physics at Harvard University and leader of the research, said in a statement. \"This simple technology, which is cheap, easy and scalable, could provide a new, cost effective way to study and diagnose viruses.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Why Pulling All-Nighters For The U.N. Climate Agreement Is A Bad Idea Science shows that sleep deprivation can ruin your decision-making. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Dec 11, 2015, 03:35 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT French Foreign Affairs minister Laurent Fabius works in his office during the COP 21 United Nations Conference on climate change. MARTIN BUREAU/AFP/Getty Images What are the U.N. Climate Chief's biggest concerns gearing up to the creation of the historic climate agreement on Friday? Aside from the challenge of coming up with ambitious yet realistic legally binding guidelines for carbon reductions, and the significant financial concerns associated, she's seriously concerned about sleep deprivation . U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Chief Christiana Figueres said that her big concern is that the negotiators getting enough rest and staying focused, according to Energy Guardian . Advertisement She's got a very good point. Like college kids cramming for a final exam, the Paris negotiators are reportedly pulling all-nighters to finalize the climate agreement. The stakes are high , as the talks have been described as the last chance to avert runaway climate change before it's too late. While the delegates have spend two weeks crafting a broad skeleton of the deal, a lot of the nitty-gritty details have been left until the eleventh hour -- as is usually the case. \"United Nations negotiators are notorious for leaving everything to the last minute,\" Coral Davenport wrote for The New York Times last month. \"Once the climate talks go into overtime, they do not stop. The diplomats keep negotiating through the night, the morning, the next day, the next night, the next morning until they finish or concede failure.\" Advertisement This is a little disconcerting. No matter how capable the negotiators are or how high their stamina, they're still human beings who require sleep in order to function. As science unequivocally shows , sleep deprivation can seriously mess with our ability to stay focused, make decisions, think clearly and remain emotionally even-keeled. \"Looking at sleep deprivation, we know that it can cause deficits in cognition as well as frustration,\" Dr. Michael Breus, clinical psychologist and diplomate of the American Board of Sleep Medicine , told The Huffington Post in an email. \"In fact there is data to suggest that ethical decision-making is directly affected by sleep deprivation.\" Advertisement A 2011 study from Duke University found that sleep deprivation affects the brain in such a way that we become less sensitive to losses. Brain regions that assess positive outcomes become more active, while parts of the brain that analyze negative outcomes become less active, which can lead to riskier decision-making. Another study found that sleep deprivation impairs our ability to integrate emotion and logic to guide our decision-making. When the Challenger space shuttle exploded seconds after its launch in 1986, it was later revealed that key managers involved in the launch had slept just two hours before getting to work at 1 a.m. that day . And prior to the devastating 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill , the ship's crew had pulled a 22-hour shift loading the oil onto the ship. A third mate fell asleep at the helm and didn't wake up until it was too late to avert disaster. If there's one lesson from these catastrophes that we can apply to the Paris talks, it's that it's probably best to have your mental faculties fully intact when you're trying to draft legislation that could save the world.

John Nash Dead: 'A Beautiful Mind' Mathematician Killed In Car Accident 'A Beautiful Mind' Mathematician Killed In Car Accident Alana Horowitz May 24, 2015, 09:19 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash was killed in a car accident on Saturday, New Jersey State Police told The Huffington Post. The Princeton University scholar was 86 years old. His wife, Alicia, was also killed in the crash. According to police, they were riding in a taxi on the New Jersey Turnpike and were ejected from the vehicle. NJ.com reports that Nash and his wife were not wearing seatbelts. Advertisement Nash was the subject of the Academy Award-winning film \"A Beautiful Mind.\" The film depicted his groundbreaking work in game theory, for which he won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994. He also received the Abel Prize, one of mathematics' most prestigious honors, in March. \" A Beautiful Mind, \" which starred Russell Crowe, also depicted Nash's struggles with mental illness. Nash suffered from schizophrenia and later in life became an advocate for improving mental health care. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Mind-Controlled Robot Arm Lets Paralyzed Man Drink A Beer On His Own Mind-Controlled Robot Arm Lets Paralyzed Man Drink A Beer On His Own By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost May 23, 2015, 01:26 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A man paralyzed for 13 years can finally have a drink on his own again, thanks to a robotic arm he\u2019s able to control using his brain. \u201cI joke around with the guys that I want to be able to drink my own beer -- to be able to take a drink at my own pace, when I want to take a sip out of my beer and to not have to ask somebody to give it to me,\u201d Erik Sorto, 34, said in a news release from the California Institute of Technology. A gunshot wound when he was 21 left Sorto unable to move his arms or legs , ABC News reported. That has changed after a clinical trial that involved doctors surgically implanting a neuro-prosthetic device into the part of Sorto\u2019s brain that controls his \u201cintent to move,\u201d Engadget explained. Advertisement The results of the trial, which was a collaboration of Caltech, Keck School of Medicine of USC and Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, were published in the May 22 edition of Science journal. Scientists have outfitted patients with brain-controlled devices in the past. One big difference, though, is that previous devices have worked with the brain\u2019s motor cortex, which \u201cgenerates the electrical signals that are sent down the spinal cord and control the contractions of every muscular movement,\u201d The Guardian explained. Sorto\u2019s device was implanted into his posterior parietal cortex, or PPC, which deals with the \u201cinitial intent\u201d to make a movement, rather than the specifics of each muscle group, according to Caltech. Advertisement \"When you move your arm, you really don't think about which muscles to activate and the details of the movement -- such as lift the arm, extend the arm, grasp the cup, close the hand around the cup, and so on. Instead, you think about the goal of the movement. For example, 'I want to pick up that cup of water,'\" Dr. Richard Andersen, a Caltech neuroscience professor, said in the institution's statement. \"So in this trial, we were successfully able to decode these actual intents, by asking the subject to simply imagine the movement as a whole, rather than breaking it down into myriad components.\" This change can result in movements that are more fluid and natural than those created by earlier devices. Dr. Mindy Aisen, chief medical officer and principal investigator of the Spinal Cord Injury Model System at Rancho, told ABC News that Sorto has learned to make smoothies and even paint pictures with the device. Advertisement She added that the technology offers a lot of hope for patients who have become \u201clocked in\u201d due to strokes, ALS and other conditions. Sorto, who is still working with the technology, said in the Caltech statement that he hopes it allows him to one day be able to take care of his own hygiene needs. \u201cShaving, brushing my own teeth. That would be fantastic,\u201d he said.

Here's How You Can Plant Feelings In People's Heads, Neuroscientists Show It's not quite \"Inception,\" but it's fascinating nonetheless. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Sep 12, 2016, 03:03 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Planting new emotions in unwitting people\u2019s minds is probably nothing short of a superpower. And scientists have done just that. Using a relatively new brain-training technique known as neurofeedback , scientists at Brown University were able to make people develop positive or negative feelings about photographs toward which they\u2019d previously felt no strong emotions. In other words, they induced feelings where there were none \u2015 and without the study participants even becoming aware of it. Advertisement \u201cWe did not mean to develop a device that would be used for brainwashing,\u201d Takeo Watanabe, a professor of cognitive and linguistic science at Brown and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post. Rather, the scientists wanted to see just how well the method of neurofeedback can work. Neurofeedback has been gaining attention in recent years as a way to potentially help treat various mental health issues, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder . Neurofeedback treatment involves monitoring a patient\u2019s brain activity in real time as they experience different thoughts and feelings, and then helping the patient learn how to boost or reduce their own neural activity patterns to cope with distress. For this study, which appeared last week in the journal PLOS Biology , researchers asked 24 study participants to look at a series of photographs of faces. The participants were asked to rate the faces from very negative to neutral to very positive. Meanwhile, the researchers used fMRI brain scans to measure the patterns of neural activity that corresponded to the different ratings. Advertisement \u201cWe thought that if our technique could change facial preference, we would be able to change many other functions, particularly those related to causes of mental diseases,\u201d Watanabe said. This is where the neurofeedback began. After the initial episode of face-rating, the participants were called back for a few more days of research. As each participant lay inside a brain scanner, they were asked to play a game. First, the participant was shown a face he or she had previously rated as neutral. Then, a floating disk appeared on the display before them. The participant was asked to use his or her mind to try to make the disk bigger. If he or she could do it, they were told, they\u2019d win money. Advertisement Of course, the participants had no idea how to use their minds to make a disk grow. But unbeknownst to them, the disk was programmed to react to readings of participants\u2019 brain activity. If the participants somehow happened to produce the neural activity that corresponded to feeling either negative or positive about a face, the disk grew and they were rewarded with more money. So they did this over and over again. Later on, all participants \u2015 plus another group, who hadn\u2019t played the disk-growing game \u2015 were asked to rate the neutral faces again. This time, those people who had gone through neurofeedback by playing the game gave a slightly positive or negative rating to the same faces they\u2019d rated as neutral before. What\u2019s notable here is that when each participant was lying there in the brain scanner, trying to make a disk grow bigger with their mind, they had no idea that positive or negative feelings about faces had anything to do with it. The disk got bigger when the person\u2019s brain activity indicated \u201cpositive feeling about a face\u201d or \u201cnegative feeling about a face,\u201d but none of the participants were told about this connection. They each had to stumble onto it themselves \u2015 and when they did, they did so at an unconscious level. In other words, the participants were changing their own brain activity, not having it changed for them. Advertisement As neurofeedback techniques become better understood, they might one day be used to help people change their own brain activity in other contexts. For example, a person with PTSD might be able to undergo neurofeedback therapy and learn to develop neutral feelings about traumatic memories. To be clear, there\u2019s still much we don\u2019t know about neurofeedback. There are probably limits to its effectiveness, and even if it proves helpful to some people, the effects may wear off over time. Still, researchers are hopeful that it can be used to do some good. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Gene Cernan, Last Man To Walk On The Moon, Has Died The retired Navy commander, 82, never forgot the \"overpowering beauty of the Earth.\" By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jan 17, 2017, 08:17 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The last man in the world to take one of the most historic jaunts in human history has died. Astronaut Gene Cernan, who walked on the moon in 1972 and ended the astonishing adventure with a message of peace and hope, died at the age of 82 surrounded by his family, according to a statement NASA released Monday. \u201cOur family is heartbroken, of course , and we truly appreciate everyone\u2019s thoughts and prayers. Gene, as he was known by so many, was a loving husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend,\u201d Cernan\u2019s family said in a statement, CNN reported. His death was attributed to unspecified ongoing health issues. Advertisement We are saddened by the loss of retired NASA astronaut Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon. https://t.co/Q9OSdRewI5 pic.twitter.com/gPdFTnXF2C \u2014 NASA (@NASA) January 16, 2017 The retired Navy captain remained an indefatigable fighter for the space program and for other humans to have the opportunities to experience what he had. \u201cWhen I leave this planet, I want to know where we are headed as a nation. That\u2019s my big goal,\u201d he testified before Congress in 2011. His experience in space changed his life profoundly. \u201cI can always walk on Main Street again, but I can never return to my Valley of Taurus-Littrow [on the moon], and that cold fact has left me with a yearning restlessness,\u201d he wrote in his 1999 autobiography, The Last Man on the Moon . Advertisement \u201cIt was perhaps the brightest moment of my life, and I can\u2019t go back,\u201d he added. \u201cEnriched by a singular event that is larger than life, I no longer have the luxury of being ordinary.\u201d Cernan was a member of a very exclusive club of only a dozen men who have set foot on the moon. He and his partner, astronaut-geologist Harrison \u201cJack\u201d Schmitt, were the only two men ever to sing on the lunar surface. Cernan, the commander of NASA\u2019s Apollo 17 mission, stepped onto the moon on Dec. 14, 1972, during his third flight into space. En route to the moon, the three-man crew captured the iconic \u201cblue marble\u201d photo of the Earth showing Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the south polar ice cap. Advertisement Cernan's crew captured this iconic \"blue marble\" shot of the Earth en route to the moon. NASA Cernan called the landing \u201cthe most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime.\u201d There\u2019s \u201cno vibration. There\u2019s no noise. The ground quit talking,\u201d he recalled in a 2007 oral history recorded by NASA. \u201cThe dust is gone. It\u2019s a realization, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there [in the] universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by ... human eyes for the first time.\u201d He and Schmitt spent spent some 22 hours on the lunar surface over three days, collecting 250 pounds of moon samples. Advertisement \u201cIn that whole three days, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that became routine,\u201d Cernan recalled. \u201cBut if I had to focus on one thing ... it was just to look back at the overwhelming and overpowering beauty of this Earth. I wished I could have stayed awake for 75 hours straight. I knew when I left I\u2019d never have a chance to come back.\u201d The final steps up the ladder back to the Challenger lunar module \u201cwere tough to make,\u201d he added. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go up. I wanted to stay a while. It\u2019s like you would want to freeze that moment and take it home with you. But you can\u2019t.\u201d As he returned he said: \u201cAmerica\u2019s challenge of today has forged man\u2019s destiny of tomorrow. As we leave the moon, we leave as we came, and, God willing, we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind .\u201d Advertisement Cernan was born in Chicago in 1934 and graduated from Indiana\u2019s Purdue University in 1956. He became a Navy attack pilot before being selected for NASA\u2019s astronaut program in 1963. Three years later, he became the second American to walk in space during a Gemini 9 flight \u2015 something he called the \u201cspacewalk from hell\u201d because of several malfunctions in his spacesuit. He logged a total of 566 hours and 15 minutes in space, more than 73 hours of which were on the moon\u2019s surface, either in the module or on the ground. Cernan eventually retired from NASA in 1976. Cernan\u2019s last action on the surface of the moon in 1972 was to trace \u201cTDC\u201d \u2014 the initials of his then-9-year-old daughter, Teresa Dawn \u2014 in the lunar dust. He said he imagined someone in the far distant future would find \u201cour lunar rover and our footprints and those initials and say, \u2018I wonder who was here?

Fighting the New Stupidity Vaccines are a great triumph of the human intellect over ancient evils. That triumph must not be dimmed by ignorance, paranoia, and demagoguery. By Keith M. Parsons, Contributor Philosopher, historian, author; Professor of Philosophy at University of Houston-Clear Lake Philosopher, historian, author; Professor of Philosophy at University of Houston-Clear Lake Feb 6, 2015, 05:28 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. The ridiculous right and the loony left are in agreement: Vaccinations are a government plot to give your child autism. As longshoreman philosopher Eric Hoffer noted long ago, the nominal ideological differences between different groups of extremists are negligible. However divergent their doctrines, fringe groups are united by a deep bond of irrationality. The nuts we will have with us always, even unto the end of the world, so why get too exercised about this latest excrescence of goofiness? Two reasons: First, some of the prospective GOP presidential candidates have made noises friendly to the anti-vaxxers. Rand Paul offered an anecdote about children who are \"walking and talking\" but then develop severe mental problems after being vaccinated. Wow. Did this guy get his medical diploma from a Crackerjack box? A second and deeper reason for being concerned is that the anti-vaccination clique, though small, is another symptom of what I call \"the New Stupidity,\" the flight of sizable segments of American society and culture from scientific rationality. As I noted in an earlier post (\"How did we Become a Society Fearful of Science?\"), over the past few decades there has been an increasing tendency, evident on both the political left and the political right, to dismiss the findings of science and to disparage scientific methods and the canons of scientific rationality. We find increasingly that science gives way to dogma and that the operant definition of \"truth\" becomes \"whatever my gut tells me.\" The flight from science started in the 1980s with the rise of \"scientific\" creationism, and with the advent in the 1990s of its dressed-up cousin, \"intelligent design\" (see Living with Darwin by Philip Kitcher). It continued more recently with manufactured doubt about human-caused climate change (see Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway). In the ivory tower, anti-science has haunted departments of literature and fields such as the sociology of knowledge (see Higher Superstition , by Paul Gross and Norman Levitt). Advertisement It is easy to bemoan these developments. It is also easy to despair. As the saying goes, the gods themselves strive in vain against stupidity. If we want to oppose anti-science, we have to ponder the strategies that might work and those that will not. Below I give three strategies against anti-science. The first one definitely will not work; the second one might, and the third one is the most likely to be effective. (1) Reason. Don't bother trying to refute creationism, climate-change denialism, or the anti-vaccination propaganda. These have all been refuted time and time again. Experts have repeatedly offered copious, point-by-point answers to every claim of the science deniers. There really is nothing left to say. Everyone who can be persuaded by the scientific evidence is persuaded by it, leaving only those who will not be persuaded. Reason cannot move those whose belief is not based on reason. (2) Ridicule. Ridicule sometimes works. It is especially effective in deflating the powerful and pompous (like Rand Paul). Tina Fey deserves a Medal of Freedom for the patriotic service she did with her deadly, spot-on impersonation of Sarah Palin. However, ridicule, like brute force, is a blunt instrument that sometimes works and sometimes backfires. Silly people do not give up their absurdity when you ridicule them. They may only retreat until the sting of humiliation wears off and then come back for more. Advertisement (3) A bit of history. This might have the best chance of working with the anti-vaxxers. People who doubt the worth of vaccines need to be reminded -- in graphic terms -- just what it was like when people lived in desperate fear of dreadful diseases against which they had virtually no protection. Here are some instances: In 18th Century Europe, in a bad year, smallpox would account for 10 percent of all deaths. People were so desperate to avoid death or hideous disfigurement from smallpox that they would inject themselves with infected matter from people who had had only a mild case of the disease, hoping to only have a light case themselves and immunity thereafter. Sometimes this worked, and sometimes it did not and the full ravages of the disease were suffered. Finally, in 1796 physician Edward Jenner discovered that if you infected patients with the mild cowpox vaccine, then they would be immune to smallpox (\"vaccine\" comes from vacca, the Latin word for \"cow\"). So successfully did this procedure prevent smallpox that Napoleon had his whole army vaccinated. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In July 1885, a nine-year-old Alsatian boy named Joseph Meister was mauled by a mad dog. He was so badly bitten that he was certainly doomed to a horrible death, or, at least, he would have been at any previous time of human history. His desperate mother took him to Paris and begged Louis Pasteur to save her son. Pasteur had developed a vaccine against rabies that worked perfectly on dogs, but had never been tried on humans. Moved by the boy's terrible plight, Pasteur proceeded with the injections. The doomed boy was spared that most feared of diseases. Advertisement The year I was born, 1952, there was a terrible polio epidemic that killed thousands and crippled tens of thousands more. In those days parents lived in dread of summer, when the innocent fun of childhood might expose their loved ones to a scourge that withered limbs or condemned victims to the living death of an iron lung. One of my earliest memories is of standing in line for hours at age four to get the sugar cube with the vaccine, a miracle of deliverance for people of my generation. Doctors Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin were national heroes, and the sight of toddlers hobbling in braces began to fade into a memory. Vaccines are a great triumph of the human intellect over ancient evils. That triumph must not be dimmed by ignorance, paranoia, and demagoguery.

Elon Musk: SpaceX Launch Explosion Is 'Most Difficult' Failure In 14 Years A fireball consumed the rocket as it was being fueled for a launch. Irene Klotz Sep 9, 2016, 10:29 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Sept 9 - SpaceX founder and chief Elon Musk said on Friday he was unsure why one of the company\u2019s Falcon rockets burst into flames on its Florida launch pad last week, destroying both the rocket and an Israeli communications satellite it was due to lift into orbit. \u201cStill working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years,\u201d Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who is also the chief executive of Telsa Motors, wrote on Twitter . Advertisement Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2016 A SpaceX-led accident investigation is underway, overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Commercial Space Transportation office. A massive fireball enveloped the rocket on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine test of its first stage. The rocket was scheduled to blast off two days later. Advertisement NASA NASA / Reuters The rocket\u2019s nine engines had not yet ignited for a test firing when a fireball engulfed the upper stage. \u201cThere was no apparent heat source,\u201d Musk said on Friday. The accident destroyed the $200 million communications satellite owned by Israel-based Space Communication, which was going to be used by Facebook and Eutelsat to expand internet access in Africa. Advertisement Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX has not yet said how much damage was done to its launch pad, located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX has backlog of more than 70 launches for commercial and government customers, worth more than $10 billion. The rocket that was destroyed was the second of 29 Falcon 9 rockets to fail. It took SpaceX about three weeks to identify the likely cause of its previous accident, which occurred on June 28, 2015. Advertisement The problem was traced to a faulty bracket, which was holding a bottle of helium inside the rocket\u2019s upper stage. When the strut broke about two minutes after liftoff, the upper-stage liquid oxygen tank over-pressurized and ruptured, triggering an explosion. SpaceX replaced thousands of struts throughout its fleet and had successfully flown nine times before last week\u2019s failure. \u201cWe remain fully confident in the results of (that) investigation ... The current investigation has no bearing on this,\u201d SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton wrote in an email to Reuters. Advertisement SpaceX\u2019s next flight had been slated for later this month from a second launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. \u201cWe have confidence that SpaceX will resolve the matter and when they do we will be ready to launch,\u201d SpaceX\u2019s customer, Iridium Communications Inc, told Reuters on Friday. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

After a few shaky days, Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden's premature baby hippo, Fiona, took her wobbly first steps in the wee hours of Sunday morning. Hippo's are nocturnal, so it's not surprising that she would get a burst of energy when most people are sleeping. It was a pleasant surprise, however, to see this much movement from her following several days of setbacks. As recently as yesterday, the six-week-premature calf was having trouble getting enough oxygen and had to be tube fed by vet staff. Advertisement The last really positive report from the Zoo was posted last week when Fiona was showing progress in her pool. Advertisement Her care team expects more ups and downs as they fight to nurse her to health. She needs to gain weight and build strength before she can be reunited with mom, Bibi, and dad, Henry. For now, zoo staff is thrilled with baby steps! Learn more about the premature baby.

Centuries-Old 'Meditating' Mummy Found In Mongolia Centuries-Old 'Meditating' Mummy Found By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 4, 2015, 04:56 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A \u201cmeditating\u201d mummy has been found in Mongolia. That's right. The mummified man-- seated in the lotus position with his legs crossed and arms folded--was found last week in the Songino Khairkhan district of Ulaanbaatar, the country\u2019s capital, according to Mongolia\u2019s Morning News. \"This is an immensely important discovery that is in line with Buddhist practices in the region,\u201d Dr. John W. Olsen, a professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona and executive director of the Je Tsongkhapa Endowment for Central and Inner Asian Archaeology, told The Huffington Post. The Siberian Times reported that police recovered the mummy from a man who had been storing it in his home after finding the remains in a cave. The man allegedly had plans to sell the mummy on the black market . Experts estimate that the body, which was covered in animal skin, is around 200 years old , according to the Siberian Times. It has reportedly been delivered to a state-run forensics labs in Ulaanbaatar for further analysis. Advertisement The mummification of especially important spiritual leaders, or lamas, is a Buddhist tradition in parts of East and Central Asia, according to Olsen. Further analysis of the body could \u201cenhance our understanding of how the various lineages of Buddhism that originated in India ultimately found their way north, through Tibet, and into Mongolia,\u201d he said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Sounds The Alarm Over Science Illiteracy, And For Good Reason Anti-Vaxxers Have Neil deGrasse Tyson Worried By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 5, 2015, 03:05 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist, 'Cosmos' television show host and Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History speaks August 4, 2014 after a screening of James Cameron's 'Deepsea Challenge 3D' film at the museum in New York. AFP PHOTO/Stan HONDA (Photo credit should read STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images) Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't one to mince words. In recent weeks the celebrated astrophysicist has offered up strong opinions on everything from the motion picture Interstellar (decent science) to New Year's resolutions (doesn't make them) to deflategate (it's complicated). Recently, HuffPost Science asked Tyson to weigh in on the outbreak of measles that has spread across the country since December. Advertisement The outbreak seems to have been fueled in part by concerns over the safety of childhood vaccines that led some parents not to vaccinate their children. The vaccines have been shown to be both safe and effective, so what's up with that? In an email to The Huffington Post, Tyson offered a simple but disturbing explanation: \"Not enough of our society is trained how to understand and interpret quantitative information. This activity is a centerpiece of science literacy to which we should all strive -- the future health, wealth, and security of our democracy depend on it. Until that is achieved, we are at risk of making under-informed decisions that affect ourselves, our communities, our country, and even the world.\" Are you listening, America?

The 8 Most Important Things We've Learned About Happiness In The Past 10 Years 8 Things We've Learned About Happiness In The Past Decade By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post May 23, 2015, 10:26 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Woman making funny face We're living in a golden age of happiness -- the scientific study of happiness, at least. The field of positive psychology has exploded in growth since its inception in 1998 , dramatically increasing our understanding of human flourishing. We now know more than ever about what makes us happy, how we can spread happiness socially and geographically, and how happiness affects our physical and mental health. But it's just the beginning. In the next decade, we're likely to see not only a greater understanding of positive emotions, but also the application of this research on a practical level to improve well-being on a global scale. Advertisement \"Positive psychology has just scratched at the surface of the benefits of topics like meditation, gratitude and forgiveness,\" Emma Seppala, Ph.D., a positive psychologist at Stanford and associate director of Stanford University\u2019s Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"The next decade of research will dive deep into these topics.\" Already, this burgeoning research offers valuable tools for each one of us to bring more joy into our own lives and the lives of others. In honor of HuffPost's 10th anniversary, here are eight scientific findings about happiness from the past decade -- and reasons why we'll be happier in the future, too. 1. We get happier as we get older. Although we tend to focus on the downsides of aging, a robust body of research suggests we've got a lot to look forward to as we get older. One survey conducted in 2013 found 23 and 69 to be life's two happiest ages. Other data suggests that after happiness levels drop around mid-life, they tend to increase steadily into old age. One conducted by Duke University researchers in 2006 found that 70-year-olds tended to rate themselves as being happier than 30-year-olds did. Advertisement Why? Greater appreciations for life's little triumphs and acceptance of life's trials likely play a role, as well as lower stress levels. \"As we age, we have the opportunity to accept who we are, instead of focusing on who we feel we need to become,\" psychoanalyst Ken Eisold wrote in Psychology Today . \"We relax into being ourselves.\" \"As we age... we relax into being ourselves.\" 2. You can rewire your brain for happiness. One of the most amazing things about the human brain is neuroplasticity -- the brain's capacity to rewire itself in response to new experiences. Advertisement We can actually wire our brains for happiness by focusing our attention on positive experiences and emotions, says neuropsychologist Rick Hanson, author of Hardwiring Happiness: The New Brain Science of Contentment, Calm, and Confidence . When you linger on a positive experience, it becomes encoded in your neural chemistry. Linger on many of these experiences, and the connections become strengthened over time and easier to retrieve. \u201cThe longer the neurons fire, the more of them that fire, and the more intensely they fire, the more they\u2019re going to wire that inner strength \u2013- that happiness, gratitude, feeling confident, feeling successful, feeling loved and lovable,\" Hanson told HuffPost in 2013 . 3. Happy mind, healthy body. More and more science is revealing the depth of our mind-body connection. We know now that cultivating a positive state of mind isn't just good for your mental health -- it can also keep your body healthy and protect you from disease. Advertisement Positive emotions have been shown to boost immune system functioning , positively alter gene expression , improve sleep quality and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke , among other physical health benefits. 4. Social connection is key. Human beings are social creatures, and the quality of our relationships is inextricably linked with our physical and mental well-being. \"Over a given period, people who have strong ties to family, friends, or coworkers have a 50 percent greater chance of outliving those with fewer social connections,\" CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote last year . \"If our relationships can have such an effect on our overall health, why don't we prioritize spending time with the people around us as much as we do exercising and eating right?\" Advertisement 5. We can thrive in the face of life's challenges. The field of post-traumatic growth -- which investigates how people not only survive but come to thrive in the wake of adversity -- is one of the most exciting in all of psychology right now, says Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania. \"I believe we need to move beyond positive emotions and incorporate trauma and anxiety, and investigate how these 'negative' emotions can lead to greater personal growth and well-being,\" Kaufman told The Huffington Post in an email. 6. We're happier when we're helping others. Being kind to others is a fast track to happiness. Volunteering makes people happier and boosts their longevity, according to a 2013 review of studies from the University of Exeter . Advertisement Helping others may also be an effective way to combat feelings of disconnection in our increasingly online lives. \"Too much use of technology can actually isolate us and make us lonelier,\" Kaufman told The Huffington Post. \"Also, generations appear to be getting more and more narcissistic and self-focused, and we know that\u2019s not conducive to well-being. I think we will only be happier in the future if we can figure out a way to harness new technologies for the benefit of helping others.\" An added benefit? Kindness is contagious . 7. Lasting happiness is born of purpose. \"Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue,\" Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his 1946 manifesto Man's Search for Meaning . \"One must have a reason to 'be happy.'\" Advertisement In recent years, psychologists have demonstrated what Frankl long held to be true: Happiness doesn't just come from chasing pleasure or positive experiences. As mounting research has demonstrated, sustainable happiness ( and good health ) comes from having a deep sense of purpose in life. \"One must have a reason to 'be happy.'\" Studies have shown that a sense of purpose and meaning increases well-being and life satisfaction, boosts self-esteem and can even ward off depression. 8. Mindfulness is a gateway to happiness. You don't have to be a veteran yogi or a meditating monk to make yourself at least \"10 percent happier,\" as ABC anchor Dan Harris says , through a mindfulness practice. Studies have shown that meditation boosts positive feelings and psychological well-being , in addition to warding off stress , depression and anxiety . Advertisement \"Research suggests that we are happiest in the present,\" Seppala told HuffPost. \"We will be happier in the future, if we learn to be present!\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Amazing Fossil Find Shows Bug Inside Lizard Inside Snake It's \"essentially a prehistoric turducken,\" Discover magazine wrote. By David Moye Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sep 8, 2016, 01:14 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Paleontologists in Germany recently discovered a fossil dating back 48 million years that shows a bug that was eaten by a lizard that was eaten by a snake. Springer Heidelberg It\u2019s the food chain as you\u2019ve never seen it before \u2015 unless you were around 48 million years ago. Researchers working at Germany\u2019s Messel Pit, a disused quarry near Frankfurt, recently discovered a fossil that shows a bug inside a lizard inside a snake. Or as Discover magazine calls it: \u201cessentially a prehistoric turducken.\u201d The magnitude of this find can\u2019t be overstated: This is only the second time a fossil showing the culinary habits of so many creatures at once has been discovered, according to the scientific journal Paleobiodiversity and Paleoenvironments. Advertisement The first such discovery happened in 2008 in southwest Germany when researchers found a fossil of a fish inside an amphibian inside a shark. Paleontologist Krister Smith of Germany\u2019s Senckenberg Institute led the analysis of the snake-lizard-bug fossil and still can\u2019t get over the find. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the kind of fossil that I will go the rest of my professional life without ever encountering again, such is the rarity of these things,\u201d he told National Geographic . \u201cIt was pure astonishment.\u201d Advertisement This enhanced photo of the fossil clearly shows the lizard skeleton. The bug is the blue dot. Springer Heidelberg Researchers don\u2019t know how the snake died. But back then, the Messel Pit was a volcanic lake with toxic waters that possibly belched out clouds of poisonous carbon dioxide, which could have asphyxiated the animal, according to National Geographic. Another possibility is that the snake died near the lake and washed into it. Because the lizard is so well preserved, the researchers think the snake died no more than one to two days after consuming its prey, Smith said in a press release , which was published in German. The snake then likely sank to the bottom of the lake, where it was fossilized. Advertisement The snake measures 40 inches long, which makes Smith think it was a juvenile. The lizard was nearly 8 inches long and, despite being swallowed whole, still had an intact head crest, according to the press release. Previous fossils of prehistoric lizards found only vegetable remains. This new find suggests they may have been omnivores. Researchers said they could not determine the exact type of bug, since it wasn\u2019t well-preserved. Hey, you see if you look good after 48 million years.

Privatization Has Been a Colossal Flop We have to face the fact that our massive privatization of what once were government functions has been a failure. There are some public services that get really loused up when done privately and for profit. By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University May 23, 2015, 04:07 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Let's get this straight. I am a penny pincher, who hates waste and wants a lean and efficient government. But, that said, we have to face the fact that our massive privatization of what once were government functions has been a failure. There are some public services that get really loused up when done privately and for profit. This is a classic mismatch of wonderful theory and disastrous practice. The privatization theory is compelling. Government is inherently bloated, lazy, wasteful, dumb and inefficient because it does not have to face the discipline of the marketplace. Put public services up for private bidding and you will get the lower costs and greater efficiency that comes with free market competition. But privatization practice is often a disaster. An inefficient government monopoly is replaced by an even more inefficient private monopoly that is more expensive, wasteful and lacking in accountability or responsibility for serving the public good. The selection of private contractors is often rife with the corruption of political sweetheart deals. The profit motive consistently trumps public interest And shareholders and executives benefit at public expense, while public services deteriorate. Let's do a quick review of the scorecard. Mental Health: De-institionalization and the privatization of community mental health centers allowed the states to off-load responsibility for the severely mentally ill so that now about 300,000 are in prison and a like number are homeless. Medical Health: Our chaotic, profit-driven system delivers poor health outcomes even though it costs about twice as much per person as the more government regulated systems in the rest of the developed world. People who don't need it get too much medical care because it is profitable to providers, while one in seven people lack any coverage at all. Defense: We pay outrageously padded bills to private military contractors who deliver poor services with constant cost over-runs and virtually no accountability. Today's general becomes tomorrow's Raytheon vice president, negotiating sweetheart contracts. Water: Privatizing this precious commodity has made water more expensive and private equity funds rich. Prisons: Privatizing helped make prisons one of America's big growth industries. Lobbying for unrealistically draconian drug laws has kept the lucrative contracts coming at enormous public expense and judicial inequity. Courts: Chronic public underfunding has led to a kind of private entrepreneurship extorting large court fees that keep defendants in constant debt. You have to buy justice now in America. Police: The frequent inappropriate police shootings are no accident -- police are understaffed, underpaid, undertrained and under-screened. A demoralized and dangerous police force is a disaster for poorer communities that depend on police protection, no problem at all for gated communities with a private security force. Schools: Charter schools, once a great hope to shake up our moribund educational bureaucracy, have so far failed to live up to their promise and seem destined to benefit shareholders more than kids. The consistent failures of privatization are not self correcting. Privatization has a powerful political and economic momentum that defies logic and insulates it from public scrutiny and reform. All the leading Republican candidates for president promise more of the same -- the tea party radicals would even close down the IRS, the EPA, the Education Department and more. And countries all over Europe are following our bad example replacing their efficiently run public services with much less cost-effective private ones. What propels privatization, despite its failures? You guessed it -- money doesn't just talk, it shouts. The profit motive can be very motivating. Enormous campaign contributions from big corporations and the super-rich (expressing their Supreme Court protected, Citizen's United, right to free speech) promote the friendly politicians who support giveaway privatization. And there is a revolving door between government jobs and industry lobbying jobs that ensures sweetheart statutes and regulations that benefit the private contractors and harm the public interest. And behind it all the greedy folks with the really big bucks who are selfishly eager to reduce tax-supported public services because they don't need or use them. Capitalism and private corporations were invented in the the western world 400 years ago as a response to flourishing trade opportunities. We have since accumulated a vast experience on its pluses and minuses and on the best balanced relationship between public and private delivery of services. Adam Smith was the father of the free market. He pointed out its irreplaceable value in providing rational pricing and an efficient allocation of goods, services and resources. But Adam Smith also supported the role of government in providing services that the free market could not: national defense, post office, police, firefighting, public works, health, education, justice, transportation, banking, controlling monopolies, enforcing contracts and caring for the poor and infirm. As Adam Smith predicted, unbalanced systems don't work. Top down, government directed economies result in rampant corruption and misallocation of resources. Free-for-all free market economies also result rampant corruption and misallocation of resources. We have gone too far down the road of privatization and need to return to the kind of balanced economy that Adam Smith advocated. The multinational corporations and the super rich have used their vast political and economic power to evade paying their fair share in taxes. The eroded tax base cannot adequately support the public services that the public needs. Privatization is no more than a cover story for tax evasion by those who don't need public services and would greedily deny them to those who do.

Air Pollution Leaves Significant Traces Of Magnetic Metals In Your Brain The nanoparticles formed during combustion possibly contribute to Alzheimer's disease. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Sep 6, 2016, 06:25 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Bloomberg via Getty Images Magnetic iron nanoparticles found in traffic fumes may be able to enter the brain, according to a new study that found these particles were abundant in brain tissue of 37 people. The tiny grains may contribute to brain diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the researchers said. The nanoparticles are a form of iron oxide called magnetite. In the study, published Sep. 5 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , researchers found millions of magnetite particles in a gram of brain tissue. Advertisement Taking a closer look at these particles, they found striking similarities to airborne magnetite, said study author Barbara Maher, a scientist at the University of Lancaster. \u201cWhen we looked at the particles inside the brain, they were a match point for point with these magnetite particles that we see in the airborne pollution,\u201d Maher told The Huffington Post. Magnetite particles in the air are formed in high temperatures during combustion. \u201cWe think what\u2019s happening is that when you breathe these particles, they are small enough that they can travel up the nose and reach the brain through the olfactory bulb,\u201d Maher said. Advertisement That route to the brain is one of the few that\u2019s not protected by the blood-brain barrier, which normally restricts foreign particles in the blood from reaching the brain. Several previous studies have suggested a link between Alzheimer\u2019s and high levels of magnetite. The compound was thought to be naturally formed in the brain and crystallized in angular shapes. The new study, however, found a lot of iron particles have different characteristics. \u201cThey are rounded, matching the molten droplet shape that pollution particles generally take,\u201d Maher said. The particles were variable in size, measuring between 10 and 150 nanometers (one-billionth of a meter) in diameter. And they occur with other foreign metal particles, such as platinum and nickel. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine how they would be forming inside the brain.\u201d Advertisement From left to right, the endogenous magnetite in the brain, the magnetites in the air and the magnetite pollution particles in the brain. Barbara Maher \u201cThe recognition that nanoparticles of industrially-generated magnetite are able to make their way into the brain tissues is disturbing,\u201d Joseph Kirschink of CalTech, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study, told Newsweek . In 1992, Kirschink and his colleagues discovered that magnetite can be found inside the brain. As an environmental scientist, Maher had been been looking at magnetic properties of air pollution in the roadside atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there are abundant magnetite nanoparticles that occur as part of the urban pollution mix,\u201d Maher said. \u201cWe use those magnetic properties to measure how much atmospheric pollution there is at different places across the city.\u201d Advertisement She then became aware of studies suggesting that brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s contained more magnetite than the brains of healthy people. A 2013 study from UCLA, for example, found higher levels of iron in the brains of 31 people with Alzheimer\u2019s compared with 68 healthy people. For that study, the researchers focused on the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory formation, which shows signs of damage early in the disease. \u201cThe magnetite was thought to be damaging to the brain,\u201d Maher said. \u201cSo I began to wonder about the magnetite in urban pollution. Was that able to get into the brain?\u201d Advertisement Maher and her colleagues looked at brain tissue samples from the frontal cortex of 37 people who had lived in Mexico City and Manchester. Among those in Manchester, the analysis showed a higher concentration of magnetite in people who were older than 65 when they died, especially those with severe to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s. But younger people who were exposed to high levels of air pollution in Mexico City also showed high concentrations. The highest brain magnetite content was found in a 32-year-old Mexico City resident. Advertisement Although several studies have found higher levels of iron in various brain areas of people with Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s not fully known how iron is involved in the disease. The hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques between nerve cells, and a study published earlier this year found magnetite particles inside these plaques. Maher and her team plan next to look directly at the toxicity of these magnetite particles by studying their effects on cells grown in the lab. Another topic requiring further investigation is whether people living in suburban areas carry lower levels of the particles. This, however, will be difficult to show, because even those people could be exposed to pollution from open fires and various other sources, Maher said. Advertisement The particles are so small that wearing a mask is unlikely to be useful. To avoid getting a magnetic load from air pollution, the best option when commuting is to avoid highly polluted areas, said Maher, who tries planning her route through a park or back streets when possible. Avoiding the curb might also be a good idea, she said. \u201cThe amount of pollution drops off rapidly farther from the curbside.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists May Have Discovered A New Kind Of Humpback Whale Sound One theory is that the sounds could be related to mating. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 8, 2015, 07:40 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Biologists have long known that humpback whales use different sounds -- including clicks, whistles and pulsed calls -- to communicate, navigate, search for food and socialize. But one researcher has heard a set of mysterious, low-frequency sounds near various humpbacks off the coast of the Hawaiian island of Maui, and they're not like anything he's ever heard humpbacks do before. \"Imagine a heartbeat,\" Jim Darling, a research biologist at Whale Trust Maui , said in a release Monday, describing the sounds. Advertisement To be clear, no one knows for sure that the previously unheard sounds are actually being made by humpback whales. But on various occasions since 2005, the sounds have been heard while humpbacks were in the vicinity of recording equipment. In the most recent case, the release says, \"any fluctuation in volume appeared to match the whales\u2019 approach to the boat, and no other species of whales were known to be in the area at the time.\" One theory, National Geographic reports, is that the sounds could be related to mating . Typically, humpback vocalizations range in frequency from 80 to 4,000 hertz, according to Whale Trust. The new sounds, however, were measured at 40 hertz -- just above the threshold of what humans can hear. Advertisement Darling describes the sounds as \"ethereal\" and difficult to hear except during exceptionally quiet, calm ocean conditions. \"The first time I heard them, or realized I heard them, was in 2005 when recording social sounds from an active group of eight whales,\" Darling said in the release. \"Although I have recorded samples since, it took a long and particularly good recording of a male-female pair in 2013 to convince me they were real.\" The unusual sounds are the subject of a new paper , published last month in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America and the result of studies funded by Whale Trust and the National Geographic Society. Advertisement Darling hopes that by describing the sounds to a wider readership, he'll encourage further exploration and assessment of the phenomenon. \" I\u2019m trying to be cautious here ,\" he told NatGeo, \"as it's still possible -- although very unlikely -- that they are produced by something other than the whales.\" Kate Westaway via Getty Images Advertisement Ultimately, if the sounds can be conclusively linked to the humpbacks, Whale Trust says it would \"add a whole new dimension to the already complex repertoire found in this species' communication.\" \"We have a long way to go on understanding this -- but it does remind us of how very, very little we know about these animals,\" Darling said in the release. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists In Last-Minute Scramble To Save Environmental Data Before Trump Takes Over Sierra Club files major request for records to buy some time. By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Jan 14, 2017, 12:02 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Climate change scientists steel for expected Trump administration storm. imagedepotpro via Getty Images Scientists across the nation are in a frantic push to save as much environmental data as possible before a feared government information purge orchestrated by climate-change denier Donald Trump . The Sierra Club on Thursday filed Freedom of Information Act requests , seeking information held by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, Bloomberg reports. The organization is asking those agencies to turn over a multitude of documents, including data on greenhouse gas emissions and power plants. Even if the requests are ultimately denied, the move buys valuable extra time for a mounting effort to gather and preserve data before anything is lost. Advertisement \u201cWe\u2019re interested in trying to download and preserve the information, but it\u2019s going to take some time,\u201d senior Sierra Club attorney Andrea Issod told Bloomberg. \u201cWe hope our request will be a counterweight to the coming assault on this critical pollution and climate data.\u201d Researchers fear that the incoming administration could wipe out important information on a broad range of environmental factors. \u201cThere is no reason to think its efforts would be restricted to climate data alone,\u201d Gretchen Goldman, a research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Pacific Standard. She\u2019s concerned about data on animals, particularly research by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on endangered or threatened species. Advertisement \u201cThere are a lot more eyes on climate, whereas with federal endangered species science, there are a smaller number of people looking at it and there are fewer data,\u201d making it more vulnerable, she added. Fears about data purges were sparked when Trump\u2019s transition team reached out to the U.S. Energy Department in December demanding the names of employees and contract experts working on environmental and climate change issues. Observers worried that was the first step in a political witch hunt against those scientists . Trump has called climate change a \u201choax\u201d by the Chinese to \u201cmake U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\u201d Incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus more recently said his boss believes it\u2019s a \u201c bunch of bunk .\u201d Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who have been picked by Trump to lead the EPA, has expressed doubts that human-caused pollution is responsible for what\u2019s happening in the environment. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 Advertisement While the Sierra Club presses its request for data, other organized efforts are continuing to save what can be preserved from government databases and post the information on independent websites. A major part of that effort, DataRefuge , is headquartered at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Program in the Environmental Humanities. Other efforts include Guerrilla Archiving and Climate Mirror to save environmental information, and the End of Term Web Archive , which attempts to save as many records as possible from outgoing presidential administrations.

Data purges and manipulation have been carried out by other administrations. Under President George W. Bush, the EPA moved to shut down some of its research libraries, reducing access to important information. The administration was also accused by the Union of Concerned Scientists of suppressing or distorting research by government scientists or contractors at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Canada\u2019s former conservative government was responsible for purging significant fishery and ocean data. Advertisement Trump and his supporters have been \u201csalivating at the possibility of dismantling federal climate research programs for years. It\u2019s not unreasonable to think they would want to take down the very data that they dispute ,\u201d Michael Halpern of the Union for Concerned Scientists told The Washington Post in a recent email. \u201cScientists are right to preserve data and archive websites before those who want to dismantle federal climate change research programs storm the castle.\u201d Related Donald Trump Climate Change Sustainability Nature Energy This Is VERY Bad For The Fight Against Climate Change Trump Team Requests List Of Government Employees Who Worked On Climate Change Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

NASA Has A Whole Lot Of Science Planned For 2017 It remains to be seen how these plans will fare under the next president. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 29, 2016, 06:06 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT NASA has a whole lot of research planned for 2017, including continued work to transport humans to Mars and efforts to track our home planet\u2019s changing climate, despite an incoming administration that\u2019s proved to be highly antagonistic to science in general. The U.S. space agency released a video Wednesday of next year\u2019s planned ventures, which include interplanetary missions involving the red planet, Saturn and Jupiter; new programs to develop environmentally friendly aviation ; and ongoing exploration of the known and unknown universe. Advertisement The agency will also monitor the total solar eclipse in August. However, one of NASA\u2019s potentially controversial initiatives includes continued monitoring of earth sciences and weather phenomena, inevitably linked to climate change research. The agency this year launched new satellite missions to track sea level rise and has plans to install two Earth-observing instruments on the International Space Station next year, one to monitor the ozone layer and another to track lightning. While the agency\u2019s plans are expansive, it\u2019s unclear how they\u2019ll fare under the administration of incoming President Donald Trump , a man who has doubted the science behind climate change (which he\u2019s called a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese ). Just last month, one of the president-elect\u2019s space advisers said he hoped Trump would end NASA\u2019s research into the phenomenon , calling it \u201cpoliticized science\u201d that distracts the agency from exploration. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Raise Alarm Over Truth-Averse Trump Administration \"When officials use 'alternative facts' without embarrassment, you know there's a problem.\" By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Feb 17, 2017, 12:56 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Some of the world\u2019s top scientists are sounding an alert over an oppressive Trump administration and its suppression of important scientific facts, especially on climate change . \u201cWhen officials use a phrase like \u2018alternative facts\u2019 without embarrassment, you know there\u2019s a problem ,\u201d physicist Rush Holt, CEO of the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science, said at a press briefing Thursday in Boston before the AAAS annual meeting. \u201c Ideological assertions have been crowding out evidence in public and private debates and in policy,\u201d Holt told The Guardian. \u201cPeople are truly troubled by what this means for the practice of science.\u201d Advertisement Holt and other scientists expressed dismay at the Trump administration\u2019s silencing of scientists working for the federal government, concerned that important legislation will be passed by politicians with little knowledge of actual facts. The silencing of many official channels has given birth to several \u201calternative\u201d Twitter sites, such as RogueNASA and AltEPA , purporting to be the voice of truth from inside federal agencies. Last month, a national alliance of government employees, including scientists, sent a letter to the president asking him to protect scientific integrity, warning that censoring science was a no-win situation with serious consequences for the environment. Environmentalist and technology expert John Holdren, who was science adviser for the Obama administration, singled out the proposed \u201cSecret Science\u201d Reform Act, which aims to whittle down the power of the Environmental Protection Agency because the GOP claims its actions have been based on \u201c biased, politicized science .\u201d Advertisement \u201cThe bill is really an attempt to squelch \u2026 and intimidate climate scientists,\u201d Holdren said. AAAS President Barbara Schaal said in her conference speech that \u201cthe role of science is to speak truth to power .\u201d The biologist also pointed out that good science relies on scientists crossing borders to share information. Scientists at the AAAS conference will be addressing climate change and the effect of immigration restrictions on scientific knowledge, among other issues, and how to address their concerns in the Trump administration. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LOMPOC, Calif. - NASA\u2019s first mission of 2015 is underway, successfully launching a Delta II rocket equipped with a soil moisture mapping satellite at 9:22 a.m. EST Saturday from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the Central Coast of California. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite is set to track moisture in the Earth\u2019s soil and help scientists better track and forecast extreme weather events such as floods, drought and landslides. The Delta II rocket lights up the Pacific Ocean early Saturday morning off the coast of California. Photo by Brian Milne. Advertisement \"The launch of SMAP completes an ambitious 11-month period for NASA that has seen the launch of five new Earth-observing space missions to help us better understand our changing planet,\" NASA administrator Charles Bolden said. \"Scientists and policymakers will use SMAP data to track water movement around our planet and make more informed decisions in critical areas like agriculture and water resources.\" Shortly after launch, two engine cutoff stages were completed, and within the first hour, the SMAP spacecraft had separated from the rocket off the east coast of Africa en route to an operation orbit at an elevation of 426 miles. \u201cWe had zero launch vehicle problems on Delta II,\u201d NASA launch manager Tim Dunn said shortly after the launch. \u201cWe had zero spacecraft problems. The 30th Space Wing continues to provide rock-solid support. Absolutely spectacular performance from all agencies contributing to the SMAP mission.\u201d Advertisement Here\u2019s is a NASA-provided video of the spacecraft separation from the Delta II: SMAP is expected to orbit the earth every 2-3 days, providing the highest-resolution maps of soil moisture ever obtained from space. \u201cWe\u2019re in contact with SMAP and everything looks good right now,\u201d Dunn added. \u201cDeployment of the solar arrays is underway. We just couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d Advertisement SMAP is the fifth and final Earth science mission by NASA over the past year, with a goal of monitoring the planet's \u201cvital signs\u201d and help scientists better understand climate change. NASA officials said data from the mission will be made publicly via NASA\u2019s SMAP website in coming weeks. The mission, which had been delayed twice because of high winds earlier in the week, is expected to last at least three years.

The Medusa Nebula Looks Way Prettier Than Its Namesake In Luminous New Photo New Photo Shows Medusa Nebula Is Way Prettier Than Its Namesake By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post May 21, 2015, 08:31 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Way out in space, some 1,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Gemini, lies the Medusa Nebula--so named because its glowing snakelike filaments of gas resemble the serpents that crown the head of the the hideous Gorgon of Greek mythology. Just have a look: Advertisement Whoops, wrong Medusa. But do have a look at the right Medusa (below) as it appears in a stunning new photograph taken by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. One look at the image--said to be the most detailed ever taken of the planetary nebula --and you'll know right away why astronomers gave it that name: OK, maybe it's not entirely obvious why such a lovely nebula got such an ugly name. No matter. At least we can all agree that it's easier to remember the nebula by the name \"Medusa\" than by its other monikers, Abell 21 and Sharpless 2-274. Advertisement Whatever you call it, with a span of some 4 light-years the Medusa Nebula is as big as it is beautiful. It was discovered in 1955 by American astronomer George O. Abell . Beautiful work, George. We'll never know exactly what it felt like to discover the nebula--but the zoom sequence below just might be the next best thing.

NASA Launches Rocket On Asteroid Probe Mission The seven-year mission aims to bring back samples from the asteroid in hopes of unlocking mysteries of the origin of life. Reuters Sep 8, 2016, 07:36 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA NASA / Reuters CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - An Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Florida on Thursday carrying a robot space probe on NASA\u2019s first quest to collect samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth in hopes of learning more about the origins of life. The 19-story rocket, built and flown for NASA by United Launch Alliance, lifted off at 7:05 p.m. (2305 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, hurling the satellite explorer Osiris-Rex on its voyage to the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. Advertisement The 3,300-pound (1,500-kg) solar-powered probe separated from the rocket\u2019s upper stage an hour after blastoff, soaring into space at 22,000 mph (35,400 kph) - more than 28 times the speed of sound - to begin its $1 billion, seven-year mission. Our @OSIRISREx spacecraft is on its way, and everything is on the timeline.

Bennu is thought to be covered with organic compounds dating back to the earliest days of the solar system. Advertisement \u201cYou can think of these asteroids as literally prebiotic chemical factories that were producing building blocks of life 4.5 billion years ago, before Earth formed, before life started here,\u201d NASA astrobiologist Daniel Glavin said before launch. Scientists believe asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth delivered water and organic compounds that seeded the planet for life. Atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could help them prove that theory. Once it settles into orbit around Bennu in 2018, Osiris-Rex will spend up to two more years mapping the asteroid\u2019s surface and taking inventory of its chemical and mineral composition. Advertisement NASA NASA / Reuters Looking back at my time on Earth... \ud83c\udf0d I'm going to miss you guys, but I'm off on an adventure! #ToBennuAndBack pic.twitter.com/wTIMs1WDlC \u2014 OSIRIS-REx (@OSIRISREx) September 8, 2016 Scientists will ultimately choose a promising site on Bennu to sample and command Osiris-Rex to fly close enough to extend its robot arm to the asteroid\u2019s surface. A sampling container will then release a swirl of nitrogen gas, which will stir up gravel and soil for collection. Advertisement \u201cThe more big pieces we can get the better ... they could contain the carbon molecules that we want to see,\u201d Jim Garvin, chief scientist at NASA \u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said on NASA TV. After gathering at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of material, Osiris-Rex will fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid-sample container for a parachute descent and landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. Only one other spacecraft, Japan\u2019s Hayabusa, has previously returned samples from an asteroid to Earth, but it collected less than a milligram of material because of a series of problems. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is under way, with a return to Earth planned for December 2020. Advertisement The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Although Bennu occupies the same approximate orbital distance from the sun, it poses little threat to Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These Cute Bats Reveal Something They Have In Common With You, Dogs And Cats You might have seen this before in puppies. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Sep 8, 2016, 03:55 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Witchcraft, black magic, vampires: Dark things come to mind when you think of bats. I t all falls apart, though, when you watch how adorable they look waggling their heads. Head waggling and ear wiggling is something that cats and dogs do as they zoom in on a target or just listen to you. That\u2019s what Melville Wohlgemuth, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins, noticed in his pug. He then saw that the bats he studied, too, cocked their heads from side to side. Advertisement \u201cI have a pug, and any time I would talk to him he would do this head-tilting behavior. When I saw it in my bats I thought, \u2018What is this funny little thing that they do?\u2019\u201d Wohlgemuth said. \u201cAfter more investigation I realized that of course, there\u2019s a purpose to it.\u201d It turns out the bats cock their heads to the side when they are targeting prey. The movements of the head are synched with the bat\u2019s vocalization and improves the precision with which they localize their target, according to the findings published Thursday in PLOS Biology . Johns Hopkins University Advertisement \u201cThe main way any animal with two ears figures out where a sound is coming from is by looking at the difference in the way one sound hits the two ears,\u201d Wohlgemuth said. The sound of a car approaching from your right side, for example, is louder to your right ear and arrives at it a bit earlier than it hits the left ear. Though the tiny time difference is imperceptible, the brain can still calculate it to locate and track the car. Moving the head (which moves the ears) would accentuate these acoustic cues that are used to determine where the source of a sound is, Wohlgemuth said. Advertisement Bats are experts in auditory localization, and so are great models for neuroscience research, Wohlgemuth said. To figure out where everything is in a cluttered environment, bats produce sounds, and calculate the whereabouts of objects based on what they hear in the reflecting echo. They also use this information to change their vocalization, their flight and movements of their head and ears. Most research on bats has looked at the animals in laboratory settings in which the scientists try to keep the animals and their heads stationary. Wohlgemuth and his colleagues, Cynthia Moss and Ninad Kothari, decided to create a setting in which bats could move their heads like they would under natural conditions. But since it is hard to track head movements in a flying bat, they trained the bats to keep still, and catch worms that researchers moved toward them by a computer-controlled hook. Advertisement \u201cSo instead of a bat flying to an insect, the insect flew to the bat,\u201d Wohlgemuth said. This allowed researchers to measure the timing of head waggles and the respective location of insect prey to the bats\u2019 ears. The bats waggled their heads about once per second as they tracked the movement of the insect prey. The waggles also matched the bats\u2019 vocalizations, showing that body movement plays a role in bats\u2019 auditory localization. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

These findings in bats could apply, to some extent, to cats, dogs and humans, Wohlgemuth said. \u201cEverybody has some impression of their pet doing these kind of things,\u201d he said. \u201cThese behaviors are likely consistent across essentially any animal that uses two ears to hear.\u201d Advertisement Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

First Penis Transplants In U.S. Planned For Wounded Soldiers \"Some hope to father children. I think that is a realistic goal.\" By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Dec 7, 2015, 03:38 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Doctors could be performing the first penis transplant in the United States within months, The New York Times reported Sunday, and wounded soldiers will be the first recipients. Specialists at Johns Hopkins plan to complete 60 of the experimental procedures on veterans. \"Some hope to father children,\" Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee, the chairman of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Johns Hopkins, told the paper. \"I think that is a realistic goal.\" Advertisement Dr. W.P. Andrew Lee of Johns Hopkins says patients could possibly father children. Johns Hopkins University According to the Times, surgeons will connect nerves, veins and arteries by \"stitching them together under a microscope\" using the penis of a recently deceased donor. The procedure will take about 12 hours and will cost between $200,000 and $400,000. \"It's important they we're devoting effort to take care of the issues around vets experiencing genital trauma,\" Dr. Joseph Alukal, a urologist and director of male reproductive health at NYU Langone Medial Center, told The Huffington Post. \"These are uniquely disfiguring injuries and they carry a tremendous psychological burden.\" Advertisement Since 2005, more than 1,500 soldiers and Marines have suffered genital wounds. While some post-surgical obstacles could be corrected, Alukal said, \"the one problem you couldn't do anything for would be lack of sensation. ... You would only figure that out over months and years.\" South African doctors performed a successful penis transplant last December, and the man's surgeon announced in June of this year that his patient was expecting a child. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Is What Happens After You Die This Is What Happens After You Die By Moheb Costandi | Mosaic May 21, 2015, 08:09 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT (Photo: \u00a9 Lightning + Kinglyface and Jess Bonham) Most of us would rather not think about what happens to our bodies after death. But that breakdown gives birth to new life in unexpected ways, writes Moheb Costandi. \u201cIt might take a little bit of force to break this up,\u201d says mortician Holly Williams, lifting John\u2019s arm and gently bending it at the fingers, elbow and wrist. \u201cUsually, the fresher a body is, the easier it is for me to work on.\u201d Advertisement Williams speaks softly and has a happy-go-lucky demeanor that belies the nature of her work. Raised and now employed at a family-run funeral home in north Texas, she has seen and handled dead bodies on an almost daily basis since childhood. Now 28 years old, she estimates that she has worked on something like 1,000 bodies. Her work involves collecting recently deceased bodies from the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth area and preparing them for their funeral. \u201cMost of the people we pick up die in nursing homes,\u201d says Williams, \u201cbut sometimes we get people who died of gunshot wounds or in a car wreck. We might get a call to pick up someone who died alone and wasn\u2019t found for days or weeks, and they\u2019ll already be decomposing, which makes my work much harder.\u201d Advertisement John had been dead about four hours before his body was brought into the funeral home. He had been relatively healthy for most of his life. He had worked his whole life on the Texas oil fields, a job that kept him physically active and in pretty good shape. He had stopped smoking decades earlier and drank alcohol moderately. Then, one cold January morning, he suffered a massive heart attack at home (apparently triggered by other, unknown, complications), fell to the floor, and died almost immediately. He was just 57 years old. Now, John lay on Williams\u2019 metal table, his body wrapped in a white linen sheet, cold and stiff to the touch, his skin purplish-grey \u2013 telltale signs that the early stages of decomposition were well under way. Self-digestion Far from being \u2018dead\u2019, a rotting corpse is teeming with life. A growing number of scientists view a rotting corpse as the cornerstone of a vast and complex ecosystem, which emerges soon after death and flourishes and evolves as decomposition proceeds. Advertisement Decomposition begins several minutes after death with a process called autolysis, or self-digestion. Soon after the heart stops beating, cells become deprived of oxygen, and their acidity increases as the toxic by-products of chemical reactions begin to accumulate inside them. Enzymes start to digest cell membranes and then leak out as the cells break down. This usually begins in the liver, which is rich in enzymes, and in the brain, which has a high water content. Eventually, though, all other tissues and organs begin to break down in this way. Damaged blood cells begin to spill out of broken vessels and, aided by gravity, settle in the capillaries and small veins, discoloring the skin. Body temperature also begins to drop, until it has acclimatized to its surroundings. Then, rigor mortis \u2013 \u201cthe stiffness of death\u201d \u2013 sets in, starting in the eyelids, jaw and neck muscles, before working its way into the trunk and then the limbs. In life, muscle cells contract and relax due to the actions of two filamentous proteins (actin and myosin), which slide along each other. After death, the cells are depleted of their energy source and the protein filaments become locked in place. This causes the muscles to become rigid and locks the joints. During these early stages, the cadaveric ecosystem consists mostly of the bacteria that live in and on the living human body. Our bodies host huge numbers of bacteria; every one of the body\u2019s surfaces and corners provides a habitat for a specialized microbial community. By far the largest of these communities resides in the gut, which is home to trillions of bacteria of hundreds or perhaps thousands of different species. Advertisement The gut microbiome is one of the hottest research topics in biology; it\u2019s been linked to roles in human health and a plethora of conditions and diseases, from autism and depression to irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. But we still know little about these microbial passengers. We know even less about what happens to them when we die. In August 2014, forensic scientist Gulnaz Javan of Alabama State University in Montgomery and her colleagues published the very first study of what they have called the thanatomicrobiome (from thanatos , the Greek word for \u2018death\u2019). \u201cMany of our samples come from criminal cases,\u201d says Javan. \u201cSomeone dies by suicide, homicide, drug overdose or traffic accident, and I collect tissue samples from the body. There are ethical issues [because] we need consent.\u201d Advertisement Most internal organs are devoid of microbes when we are alive. Soon after death, however, the immune system stops working, leaving them to spread throughout the body freely. This usually begins in the gut, at the junction between the small and large intestines. Left unchecked, our gut bacteria begin to digest the intestines \u2013 and then the surrounding tissues \u2013 from the inside out, using the chemical cocktail that leaks out of damaged cells as a food source. Then they invade the capillaries of the digestive system and lymph nodes, spreading first to the liver and spleen, then into the heart and brain. Javan and her team took samples of liver, spleen, brain, heart and blood from 11 cadavers, at between 20 and 240 hours after death. They used two different state-of-the-art DNA sequencing technologies, combined with bioinformatics, to analyze and compare the bacterial content of each sample. The samples taken from different organs in the same cadaver were very similar to each other but very different from those taken from the same organs in the other bodies. This may be due partly to differences in the composition of the microbiome of each cadaver, or it might be caused by differences in the time elapsed since death. An earlier study of decomposing mice revealed that although the microbiome changes dramatically after death, it does so in a consistent and measurable way. The researchers were able to estimate time of death to within three days of a nearly two-month period. Advertisement Javan\u2019s study suggests that this \u2018microbial clock\u2019 may be ticking within the decomposing human body, too. It showed that the bacteria reached the liver about 20 hours after death and that it took them at least 58 hours to spread to all the organs from which samples were taken. Thus, after we die, our bacteria may spread through the body in a systematic way, and the timing with which they infiltrate first one internal organ and then another may provide a new way of estimating the amount of time that has elapsed since death. \"Degree of decomposition varies not only from individual to individual but also differs in different body organs,\" says Javan, \"Spleen, intestine, stomach and pregnant uterus are earlier to decay, but on the other hand kidney, heart and bones are later in the process.\" In 2014, Javan and her colleagues secured a US$200,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to investigate further. \u201cWe will do next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to see which organ is best for estimating [time of death] \u2013 that\u2019s still unclear,\u201d she says. One thing that does seem clear, however, is that a different composition of bacteria is associated with different stages of decomposition. Advertisement Bloating. (Photo: \u00a9 Lightning + Kinglyface and Jess Bonham) Putrefaction Scattered among the pine trees in Huntsville, Texas, lie around half a dozen human cadavers in various stages of decay. The two most recently placed bodies are spread-eagled near the centre of the small enclosure with much of their loose, grey-blue mottled skin still intact, their ribcages and pelvic bones visible between slowly putrefying flesh. A few meters away lies another, fully skeletonized, with its black, hardened skin clinging to the bones, as if it were wearing a shiny latex suit and skullcap. Further still, beyond other skeletal remains scattered by vultures, lies a third body within a wood and wire cage. It is nearing the end of the death cycle, partly mummified. Several large, brown mushrooms grow from where an abdomen once was. For most of us the sight of a rotting corpse is at best unsettling and at worst repulsive and frightening, the stuff of nightmares. But this is everyday for the folks at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility. Opened in 2009, the facility is located within a 247-acre area of National Forest owned by Sam Houston State University (SHSU). Within it, a nine-acre plot of densely wooded land has been sealed off from the wider area and further subdivided, by 10-foot-high green wire fences topped with barbed wire. In late 2011, SHSU researchers Sibyl Bucheli and Aaron Lynne and their colleagues placed two fresh cadavers here, and left them to decay under natural conditions. Advertisement Once self-digestion is under way and bacteria have started to escape from the gastrointestinal tract, putrefaction begins. This is molecular death \u2013 the breakdown of soft tissues even further, into gases, liquids and salts. It is already under way at the earlier stages of decomposition but really gets going when anaerobic bacteria get in on the act. Putrefaction is associated with a marked shift from aerobic bacterial species, which require oxygen to grow, to anaerobic ones, which do not. These then feed on the body\u2019s tissues, fermenting the sugars in them to produce gaseous by-products such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, which accumulate within the body, inflating (or \u2018bloating\u2019) the abdomen and sometimes other body parts. This causes further discoloration of the body. As damaged blood cells continue to leak from disintegrating vessels, anaerobic bacteria convert hemoglobin molecules, which once carried oxygen around the body, into sulfhemoglobin. The presence of this molecule in settled blood gives skin the marbled, greenish-black appearance characteristic of a body undergoing active decomposition. Advertisement As the gas pressure continues to build up inside the body, it causes blisters to appear all over the skin surface. This is followed by loosening, and then \u2018slippage\u2019, of large sheets of skin, which remain barely attached to the deteriorating frame underneath. Eventually, the gases and liquefied tissues purge from the body, usually leaking from the anus and other orifices and frequently also leaking from ripped skin in other parts of the body. Sometimes, the pressure is so great that the abdomen bursts open. Bloating is often used as a marker for the transition between early and later stages of decomposition, and another recent study shows that this transition is characterized by a distinct shift in the composition of cadaveric bacteria. Bucheli and Lynne took samples of bacteria from various parts of the bodies at the beginning and the end of the bloat stage. They then extracted bacterial DNA from the samples and sequenced it. Advertisement As an entomologist, Bucheli is mainly interested in the insects that colonize cadavers. She regards a cadaver as a specialized habitat for various necrophagous (or \u2018dead-eating\u2019) insect species, some of which see out their entire life cycle in, on and around the body. Bursting. (Photo: \u00a9 Lightning + Kinglyface and Jess Bonham) Colonization When a decomposing body starts to purge, it becomes fully exposed to its surroundings. At this stage, the cadaveric ecosystem really comes into its own: a \u2018hub\u2019 for microbes, insects and scavengers. Two species closely linked with decomposition are blowflies and flesh flies (and their larvae). Cadavers give off a foul, sickly-sweet odor, made up of a complex cocktail of volatile compounds that changes as decomposition progresses. Blowflies detect the smell using specialized receptors on their antennae, then land on the cadaver and lay their eggs in orifices and open wounds. The smell of death Advertisement Each fly deposits around 250 eggs that hatch within 24 hours, giving rise to small first-stage maggots. These feed on the rotting flesh and then molt into larger maggots, which feed for several hours before molting again. After feeding some more, these yet larger, and now fattened, maggots wriggle away from the body. They then pupate and transform into adult flies, and the cycle repeats until there\u2019s nothing left for them to feed on. Under the right conditions, an actively decaying body will have large numbers of stage-three maggots feeding on it. This \u2018maggot mass\u2019 generates a lot of heat, raising the inside temperature by more than 10\u00b0C. Like penguins huddling in the South Pole, individual maggots within the mass are constantly on the move. But whereas penguins huddle to keep warm, maggots in the mass move around to stay cool. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d Bucheli explains, surrounded by large toy insects and a collection of Monster High dolls in her SHSU office. \u201cIf you\u2019re always at the edge, you might get eaten by a bird, and if you\u2019re always in the centre, you might get cooked. So they\u2019re constantly moving from the centre to the edges and back.\u201d Advertisement The presence of flies attracts predators such as skin beetles, mites, ants, wasps and spiders, which then feed on or parasitize the flies\u2019 eggs and larvae. Vultures and other scavengers, as well as other large meat-eating animals, may also descend upon the body. In the absence of scavengers, though, the maggots are responsible for removal of the soft tissues. As Carl Linnaeus (who devised the system by which scientists name species) noted in 1767, \u201cthree flies could consume a horse cadaver as rapidly as a lion\u201d. Third-stage maggots will move away from a cadaver in large numbers, often following the same route. Their activity is so rigorous that their migration paths may be seen after decomposition is finished, as deep furrows in the soil emanating from the cadaver. Every species that visits a cadaver has a unique repertoire of gut microbes, and different types of soil are likely to harbor distinct bacterial communities \u2013 the composition of which is probably determined by factors such as temperature, moisture, and the soil type and texture. Advertisement All these microbes mingle and mix within the cadaveric ecosystem. Flies that land on the cadaver will not only deposit their eggs on it, but will also take up some of the bacteria they find there and leave some of their own. And the liquefied tissues seeping out of the body allow the exchange of bacteria between the cadaver and the soil beneath. When they take samples from cadavers, Bucheli and Lynne detect bacteria originating from the skin on the body and from the flies and scavengers that visit it, as well as from soil. \u201cWhen a body purges, the gut bacteria start to come out, and we see a greater proportion of them outside the body,\u201d says Lynne. Thus, every dead body is likely to have a unique microbiological signature, and this signature may change with time according to the exact conditions of the death scene. A better understanding of the composition of these bacterial communities, the relationships between them and how they influence each other as decomposition proceeds could one day help forensics teams learn more about where, when and how a person died. Advertisement For instance, detecting DNA sequences known to be unique to a particular organism or soil type in a cadaver could help crime scene investigators link the body of a murder victim to a particular geographical location or narrow down their search for clues even further, perhaps to a specific field within a given area. \u201cThere have been several court cases where forensic entomology has really stood up and provided important pieces of the puzzle,\u201d says Bucheli, adding that she hopes bacteria might provide additional information and could become another tool to refine time-of-death estimates. \u201cI hope that in about five years we can start using bacterial data in trials,\u201d she says. The tell-tale fly To this end, researchers are busy cataloguing the bacterial species in and on the human body, and studying how bacterial populations differ between individuals. \u201cI would love to have a dataset from life to death,\u201d says Bucheli. \u201cI would love to meet a donor who\u2019d let me take bacterial samples while they\u2019re alive, through their death process and while they decompose.\u201d Advertisement Unraveling. (Photo: \u00a9 Lightning + Kinglyface and Jess Bonham) Purging \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the purging fluid that comes out of decomposing bodies,\u201d says Daniel Wescott, director of the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State University in San Marcos. Wescott, an anthropologist specializing in skull structure, is using a micro-CT scanner to analyze the microscopic structure of the bones brought back from the body farm. He also collaborates with entomologists and microbiologists \u2013 including Javan, who has been busy analyzing samples of cadaver soil collected from the San Marcos facility \u2013 as well as computer engineers and a pilot, who operate a drone that takes aerial photographs of the facility. \u201cI was reading an article about drones flying over crop fields, looking at which ones would be best to plant in,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were looking at near-infrared, and organically rich soils were a darker color than the others. I thought if they can do that, then maybe we can pick up these little circles.\u201d Advertisement Those \u201clittle circles\u201d are cadaver decomposition islands. A decomposing body significantly alters the chemistry of the soil beneath it, causing changes that may persist for years. Purging \u2013 the seeping of broken-down materials out of what\u2019s left of the body \u2013 releases nutrients into the underlying soil, and maggot migration transfers much of the energy in a body to the wider environment. Eventually, the whole process creates a \u2018cadaver decomposition island\u2019, a highly concentrated area of organically rich soil. As well as releasing nutrients into the wider ecosystem, this attracts other organic materials, such as dead insects and fecal matter from larger animals. According to one estimate, an average human body consists of 50\u201375 per cent water, and every kilogram of dry body mass eventually releases 32 g of nitrogen, 10 g of phosphorous, 4 g of potassium and 1 g of magnesium into the soil. Initially, it kills off some of the underlying and surrounding vegetation, possibly because of nitrogen toxicity or because of antibiotics found in the body, which are secreted by insect larvae as they feed on the flesh. Ultimately, though, decomposition is beneficial for the surrounding ecosystem. The microbial biomass within the cadaver decomposition island is greater than in other nearby areas. Nematode worms, associated with decay and drawn to the seeping nutrients, become more abundant, and plant life becomes more diverse. Further research into how decomposing bodies alter the ecology of their surroundings may provide a new way of finding murder victims whose bodies have been buried in shallow graves. Advertisement Grave soil analysis may also provide another possible way of estimating time of death. A 2008 study of the biochemical changes that take place in a cadaver decomposition island showed that the soil concentration of lipid-phosphorous leaking from a cadaver peaks at around 40 days after death, whereas those of nitrogen and extractable phosphorous peak at 72 and 100 days, respectively. With a more detailed understanding of these processes, analyses of grave soil biochemistry could one day help forensic researchers to estimate how long ago a body was placed in a hidden grave. New Life. (Photo: \u00a9 Lightning + Kinglyface and Jess Bonham) Burial In the relentless dry heat of a Texan summer, a body left to the elements will mummify rather than decompose fully. The skin will quickly lose all of its moisture, so that it remains clinging to the bones when the process is complete. The speed of the chemical reactions involved doubles with every 10\u00b0C rise in temperature, so a cadaver will reach an advanced stage of decomposition after 16 days at an average daily temperature of 25\u00b0C. By then, most of the flesh has been removed from the body, and so the mass migration of maggots away from the carcass can begin. Advertisement The ancient Egyptians learned inadvertently how the environment affects decomposition. In the predynastic period, before they started building elaborate coffins and tombs, they wrapped their dead in linen and buried them directly in the sand. The heat inhibited the activity of microbes, while burial prevented insects from reaching the bodies, and so they were extremely well preserved. Later on, they began building elaborate tombs for the dead, in order to provide even better for their afterlife, but this had the opposite of the intended effect \u2013separating the body from the sand actually hastened decomposition. And so they invented embalming and mummification. How nature can mummify a brain Embalming involves treating the body with chemicals that slow down the decomposition process. The ancient Egyptian embalmer would first wash the body of the deceased with palm wine and Nile water, remove most of the internal organs through an incision made down the left-hand side, and pack it with natron (a naturally-occurring salt mixture found throughout the Nile Valley). He would use a long hook to pull the brain out through the nostrils, then cover the entire body with natron and leave it to dry for 40 days. Initially, the dried organs were placed into canopic jars that were buried alongside the body; later, they were wrapped in linen and returned to the body. Finally, the body itself was wrapped in multiple layers of linen, in preparation for burial. Morticians study the ancient Egyptian embalming method to this day. Back at the funeral home, Holly Williams performs something similar so that family and friends can view their departed loved one at the funeral as they once were, rather than as they now are. For victims of trauma and violent deaths, this can involve extensive facial reconstruction. Living in a small town, Williams has worked on many people she knew or grew up with \u2013 friends who overdosed, committed suicide or died texting at the wheel. When her mother died four years ago, Williams did some work on her, too, adding the final touches by making up her face: \u201cI always did her hair and make-up when she was alive, so I knew how to do it just right.\u201d She transfers John to the prep table, removes his clothes and positions him, then takes several small bottles of embalming fluid from a wall cupboard. The fluid contains a mixture of formaldehyde, methanol and other solvents; it temporarily preserves the body\u2019s tissues by linking cellular proteins to each other and \u2018fixing\u2019 them into place. The fluid kills bacteria and prevents them from breaking down the proteins and using them as a food source. Advertisement Williams pours the bottles\u2019 contents into the embalming machine. The fluid comes in an array of colors, each matching a different skin tone. Williams wipes his body with a wet sponge and makes a diagonal incision just above his left collarbone. She \u2018raises\u2019 the carotid artery and subclavian vein from the neck, ties them off with pieces of string, then pushes a cannula (thin tube) into the artery and small tweezers into the vein to open up the vessels. Next, she switches the machine on, pumping embalming fluid into the carotid artery and around John\u2019s body. As the fluid goes in, blood pours out of the incision, flowing down along the guttered edges of the sloped metal table and into a large sink. Meanwhile, she picks up one of his limbs to massage it gently. \u201cIt takes about an hour to remove all the blood from an average-sized person and replace it with embalming fluid,\u201d Williams says. \u201cBlood clots can slow it down, so massaging breaks them up and helps the flow of the embalming fluid.\u201d Once all the blood has been replaced, she pushes an aspirator into John\u2019s abdomen and sucks the fluids out of the body cavity, together with any urine and faeces that might still be in there. Finally, she sews up the incisions, wipes the body down a second time, sets the facial features and re-dresses it. John is now ready for his funeral. Advertisement Embalmed bodies do eventually decompose. Exactly when, and how long it takes, depends largely on how the embalming was done, the type of casket in which the body is placed and how it is buried. Bodies are, after all, merely forms of energy, trapped in lumps of matter waiting to be released into the wider universe. What is a \u2018natural\u2019 burial? According to the laws of thermodynamics, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In other words: things fall apart, converting their mass to energy while doing so. Decomposition is one final, morbid reminder that all matter in the universe must follow these fundamental laws. It breaks us down, equilibrating our bodily matter with its surroundings, and recycling it so that other living things can put it to use. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

Take A Look Inside Yellowstone, One Of America's Wildest Places \"Wild Yellowstone\" showcases the breathtaking beauty of America's first national park. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 6, 2015, 01:57 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Credit: Ryan Sheets/National Geographic Channels The National Park Service, the agency tasked with championing America's 59 national parks, will celebrate its 100th birthday next year. Those parks encompass some of the most diverse landscapes in the world, from the deserts of Joshua Tree to the caldera of Crater Lake. But in 1872, it all began with a place called Yellowstone. America's oldest national park has never been more popular , and a new two-part documentary special from Nat Geo WILD -- aptly called \" Wild Yellowstone \" -- will showcase the landscape's stunning natural beauty. Advertisement Credit: Steve Rogers/National Geographic Channels Yellowstone lies predominantly in Wyoming and hosts some of the most active geothermal features on the planet, spanning from geysers to fumaroles to hot springs. But the park is also home to many of America's most iconic species -- elk, river otters, beavers and those behemoths the grizzly bears. All have a prominent role in \"Wild Yellowstone,\" which features both the summer and winter seasons within the park. Perhaps the most pivotal message of the show is the terribly challenging road to survival. Grizzlies must spend months feeding on everything from moths to elk carcasses to fatten up before hibernation. Big horn sheep use their impressive headgear to ram their opponents into submission and win over a few ewes. Beavers have to craft a near-perfect dam and haul a winter's supply of trees into their storage ponds or they may run out of food. Advertisement Even the hummingbirds have to battle for their right to eat. Striking footage of a wolf pack hunting through the snow showcases perhaps the most hated animal in America, which was reintroduced to the park between 1995 and 1997. The population is now booming , the epitome of a success story, despite the animals' detractors. But even for an apex predator, life is a battle, and it is truly a land where only the fit survive. It's a rough but breathtakingly beautiful place. The documentary made its official premiere at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival earlier this year and took home the awards for best editing and best cinematography. Advertisement Many of the most compelling scenes, like that of a fox diving snout-first into the snow , build on critical camera work seen in features like the BBC's \"Planet Earth.\" National Geographic partnered with the folks at Brain Farm to use next-gen camera technology to capture ultraslow-motion animal behavior seldom seen on screen. Throughout the National Park Service's centennial celebrations, the agency is encouraging the public to get outside and find their local parks . With winter approaching, dozens of the country's wild places are still ripe for exploring. As Bill Nye told The Huffington Post earlier this year of national parks, \"They're precious, they're priceless and they need to be preserved.\" And the best way to encourage preservation is to get out there and be awed.

NASA May Turn To Ice To House Astronauts On Mars The space agency wants to make use of a resource the planet already has in abundance. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 2, 2017, 03:25 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT An artist's rendering of the Mars Ice Home concept. Credit: NASA/Clouds AO/SEArch NASA has released a daring new concept for a building that could someday house astronauts on Mars, as the space agency continues push toward its goal of sending humans to the red planet by the 2030s . Dubbed the \u201cMars Ice Home,\u201d the structure would rely on a protective coating of ice drawn from the surface of the planet. According to NASA, the low-tech building would both protect astronauts from Mars\u2019 harmful cosmic radiation and be almost infinitely scalable. Advertisement Researchers recently said that Mars holds massive reserves of ice frozen beneath its surface, almost as much as in Lake Superior. That\u2019s why scientists turned to the material when envisioning a future home for Mars residents. \u201cAfter a day dedicated to identifying needs, goals and constraints we rapidly assessed many crazy, out of the box ideas and finally converged on the current Ice Home design, which provides a sound engineering solution,\u201d Kevin Vipavetz, the facilitator of a design session at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center that produced the idea in partnership with Space Exploration Architecture and Clouds Architecture Office , said in a press release . The design is just one in a series of potential concepts for structures on Mars, but the idea has several major boons. The building\u2019s structure would be lightweight, able to be deployed using robots and filled with water before any humans arrive, NASA said. The water stored in the building could also be used to craft rocket fuel . Advertisement NASA is actively working toward a manned mission to Mars . It plans to send another rover to the planet in 2020 to follow up on the work by the Curiosity , and aims to start a series of missions in 2018 near the moon to test human capacity for life off Earth. While the ice home is a novel idea, there are no guarantees what design the space agency will ultimately use on the planet. The dome already has some major drawbacks, namely that it\u2019d take more than a year to fill with ice. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

SpaceX Launches First Rocket Since Explosion, Returns Stage To Earth Saturday\u2019s flight begins to clear a logjam of more than 70 planned missions. Reuters Jan 14, 2017, 02:32 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT SpaceX Falcon rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, U.S., January 14, 2017. Gene Blevins / Reuters A SpaceX Falcon rocket blasted off from California on Saturday, returning the company to flight for the first time since a fiery launchpad explosion in September. The launch of the 230-foot (70-meter) rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:54 a.m. PST (1754 GMT) aimed to deliver 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc. Advertisement SpaceX\u2019s founder and entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious flight plans had been grounded since the Sept. 1 explosion during fueling ahead of a pre-flight test in Florida. About 10 minutes after Saturday\u2019s launch, the first stage of the rocket, which had separated from the rest of craft, successfully touched down on a platform in the Pacific Ocean, a feat previously accomplished by four other returning Falcon rockets. SpaceX intends to reuse its rockets to cut costs. The mission will test changes implemented by Space Exploration Technologies Corp, known as SpaceX, since the launchpad explosion. Advertisement Accident investigators determined that a canister of helium burst inside the rocket\u2019s second-stage liquid oxygen tank, triggering the explosion. The canister is being redesigned, but until then SpaceX is addressing the issue by modifying its fueling procedures. The explosion destroyed a $62 million SpaceX booster and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite that it was to put into orbit two days later. The accident clouded the company\u2019s aggressive agenda, which includes beginning to ferry U.S. astronauts into space next year, when it also plans to make its first voyage to Mars. Advertisement Saturday\u2019s flight begins to clear a logjam of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion, awaiting flights on SpaceX Falcon rockets, which last flew in August, SpaceX said. The launch is the first in a seven-flight contract with Iridium worth $468.1 million, company spokeswoman Diane Hockenberry said. SpaceX aims to launch 27 rockets in 2017, more than triple the eight flights the privately held firm managed in 2016, according to a report on Friday in the Wall Street Journal. Advertisement In addition to its dozens of commercial customers, SpaceX is one of two companies hired by NASA to fly cargo to the International Space Station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The company\u2019s 2017 agenda includes the debut launch of a heavy-lift booster, flying its first reused rocket and repairing the Florida launchpad damaged in the explosion. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Fossils May Belong To New Primitive Human Species Have Scientists Discovered New Primitive Human Species? By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 1, 2015, 07:37 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Have scientists discovered a new species of primitive human? Two teams of researchers have been asking that very question after analyzing mysterious fossils found in China and Taiwan. The fossils don't seem to fit with any known hominin species --including modern humans, Homo erectus or Neanderthals. Instead, they may be the result of interbreeding between known species, or perhaps even belong to an unknown human species. \"Classically, everything that inhabited Asia before the arrival of modern humans have been classified into a single taxon: H. erectus,\" Dr. Mar\u00eda Martin\u00f3n-Torres, a dental anthropologist at Spain\u2019s National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH) and a researcher involved in one of the studies, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"However, we now see that we may have put in the same box things that are different... It may be time to revise that.\" (Story continues below photo.) The nine teeth examined while studying fossils of unidentified hominins. Advertisement For the research, Martin\u00f3n-Torres and her colleagues analyzed nine teeth from four individuals, which were unearthed in a cave at Northern China's Xujiayao site in 1976. The teeth, which date back 60,000 to 120,000 years, were compared to more than 5,000 dental samples taken from a variety of hominin species. The researchers looked at the teeths' features such as grooves and cusps, the size of the crown and root system, and their positions relative to one another, BBC reported. What did the researchers find? Though the nine teeth shared some isolated features with Neanderthals, they did not match completely with any of the samples included in the study. Advertisement \"What we have seen is an unknown group for us,\" Martin\u00f3n-Torres told BBC. \"It's not H. sapiens and it's not H. neanderthalensis. They have a mixture of something very primitive, which is currently unknown. We cannot go further to say it's a new species because we need to compare it to other things.\" The study has been published in the February issue of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. Another mysterious, unidentified fossil A separate, unrelated study published this week hints at the possibility of yet another new primitive human species that may have lived in prehistoric Asia. A team of researchers in Japan, Taiwan and Australia examined the lower, right jaw of a hominin found in the Penghu submarine channel off the western coast of Taiwan. The fossil, dubbed Penghu 1, dates back 10,000 to 190,000 years. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Again, when the fossil was compared to samples from a variety of hominin species, including Neanderthals, Homo sapiens and Homo habilis, it didn't completely match with any of them. The findings of this study were published online in the journal Nature Communications on Jan. 27, 2015. Advertisement Whatever or not the fossils end up belonging to a new species, they're painting a radically new picture of human evolution in Asia, the researchers say. They suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia around 50,000 to 40,000 years ago, a much more diverse group of ancient hominins lived there than previously thought. \"We need other skeletal parts to evaluate the degree of its uniqueness,\"study co-author Dr. Yousuke Kaifu, a paleoanthropologist at Japan's National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo, told Live Science. \" The question of species can be effectively discussed after those steps.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

All The Mathematical Methods I Learned In My University Math Degree Became Obsolete In My Lifetime All The Methods I Learned In My Mathematics Degree Became Obsolete In My Lifetime By Keith Devlin, Contributor Dr Keith Devlin is a mathematician at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.

LEAVE A COMMENT PeopleImages via Getty Images If you are connected with the world of K-12 mathematics education, it\u2019s highly unlikely that a day will go by without you uttering, writing, hearing, or reading the term \u201cnumber sense\u201d. In contrast everyone else on the planet would be hard pressed to describe what it is. Though entering the term into Google will return close to 38 million hits, it has yet to enter the world\u2019s collective consciousness. Stanford mathematician Keith Devlin explains what it is. When I graduated with a bachelors degree in mathematics from one of the most prestigious university mathematics programs in the world (Kings College London) in 1968, I had acquired a set of skills that guaranteed full employment, wherever I chose to go, for the then-foreseeable future\u2014a state of affairs that had been in existence ever since modern mathematics began some three thousand years earlier. By the turn of the new Millennium, however, just over thirty years later, those skills were essentially worthless, having been very effectively outsourced to machines that did it faster and more reliably, and were made widely available with the onset of first desktop- and then cloud-computing. In a single lifetime, I experienced first-hand a dramatic change in the nature of mathematics and how it played a role in society. Advertisement The shift began with the introduction of the electronic calculator in the 1960s, which rendered obsolete the need for humans to master the ancient art of mental arithmetical calculation. Over the succeeding decades, the scope of algorithms developed to perform mathematical procedures steadily expanded, culminating in the creation of desktop packages such as Mathematica and cloud-based systems such as Wolfram Alpha that can execute pretty well any mathematical procedure, solving\u2014accurately and in a fraction of a second\u2014any mathematical problem formulated with sufficient precision (a bar that allows in all the exam questions I and any other math student faced throughout our entire school and university careers). So what, then, remains in mathematics that people need to master? The answer is, the set of skills required to make effective use of those powerful new (procedural) mathematical tools we can access from our smartphone. Whereas it used to be the case that humans had to master the computational skills required to carry out various mathematical procedures (adding and multiplying numbers, inverting matrices, solving polynomial equations, differentiating analytic functions, solving differential equations, etc.), what is required today is a sufficiently deep understanding of all those procedures, and the underlying concepts they are built on, in order to know when, and how, to use those digitally-implemented tools effectively, productively, and safely. Advertisement In many ways, that change in the society-required focus of mathematics education echoed a change in the nature of mathematics as an intellectual discipline that had taken placed in the late nineteenth century. Beginning in Germany (in particular, the small university town of Goettingen), the primary focus of mathematics shifted dramatically at that time from executing procedures to solve problems, to analyzing and understanding properties of, and relationships between, abstract mathematical concepts. The most basic of today\u2019s new mathematical skills is number sense . (The other important one is mathematical thinking . But whereas the latter is important only for those going into STEM careers, number sense is a crucial 21st Century life-skill for everyone.) Descriptions of the term \u201cnumber sense\u201d generally run along the lines of \u201cfluidity and flexibility with numbers, a sense of what numbers mean, and an ability to use mental mathematics to negotiate the world and make comparisons.\u201d The well-known mathematics educator Marilyn Burns, in her 2007 book, About Teaching Mathematics , describes students with a strong number sense like this: \u201c[They] can think and reason flexibly with numbers, use numbers to solve problems, spot unreasonable answers, understand how numbers can be taken apart and put together in different ways , see connections among operations, figure mentally, and make reasonable estimates.\u201d In 1989, the US-based National Council of Teachers identified the following five components that characterize number sense: number meaning, number relationships, number magnitude, operations involving numbers and referents for number, and referents for numbers and quantities. Though to outsiders, mathematics teaching designed to develop number sense can seem \u201cfuzzy\u201d and \u201cimprecise\u201d, it has been well demonstrated that children who do not acquire number sense early in their mathematics education struggle throughout their entire subsequent school and college years, and generally find themselves cut off from any career that requires some mathematical ability. That outsiders\u2019 misperception is understandable. Compared to the rigid, rule-based, right-or-wrong precision of the math taught in my schooldays, number sense (and mathematical thinking) do seem fuzzy and imprecise. But the fuzziness and imprecision is precisely why that is such an important aspect of mathematics in an era where the rule-based, precise part is done by machines. The human brain compares miserably with the digital computer when it comes to performing rule-based procedures. But that human mind can bring something that computers cannot begin to do, and maybe never will: understanding . Desktop-computer and cloud-based mathematics systems provide useful tools to solve the mathematical aspects of real-world problems. But without a human in the driving seat, those tools are totally useless. And high among the \u201cdriving abilities\u201d required to do that is number sense. Advertisement If you are a parent of a child in the K-12 system, there is today just one thing you should ensure your offspring has mastered in the math class by the time they graduate: number sense. Once they have that, any specific concept or procedure that you or they will find listed in the K-12 curriculum can be mastered (in the nature and to the degree required, given that procedural execution can be done by machine) quickly and easily as and when required. An analogous state of affairs arises at the college level, with the much broader notion of mathematical thinking in place of number sense. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Make no mistake about it, acquiring that modern-day mathematical skillset definitely requires spending time carrying out the various procedures. Your child or children will still spend time \u201cdoing math\u201d in the way you remember. But whereas the focus used to be on mastering the skills with the goal of carrying out the procedures accurately \u2014 something that, thanks to the learning capacity of the human brain, could be achieved without deep, conceptual understanding \u2014 the focus today is on that conceptual understanding. That is a very different goal, and quite frankly a much more difficult one to reach. This, by the way, is the new state of affairs that the mathematics Common Core was created to address. Outsiders, including politicians in search of populist issues to incite voters and others with an axe to grind, have derided caricatured portrayals of this important new educational goal, by describing it as \u201cwoolly\u201d and \u201cfuzzy\u201d. But I disposed of that uninformed red herring already. The fact is, number sense is (rightly, and importantly) the primary focus of 21st Century K-12 mathematics education that millions of children around the world are receiving today. Children who are not getting such an education are going to be severely handicapped in the world they are being educated to inhabit. In a follow-up article , I look at some of the research behind the move away from computational mastery of procedures to the development of number sense in the K-12 education world, and say something about how it can best be taught. This article is an expanded version of an essay published on Edge.org on January 1, 2017.

Old Brains Become Young Again In Neuroplasticity Study Scientists Boost Older Brains' Ability To Heal And Learn By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post May 20, 2015, 12:57 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Can an old brain learn new tricks? The answer could soon be a resounding \"yes.\" Scientists from the University of California at Irvine may have found a way to restore the youthful flexibility of the still-developing brain. In a study on mice recently published in the journal Neuron , the researchers were able to re-activate a younger neural state in an older brain. While the findings are preliminary, they could one day lead to new treatments for developmental disorders -- and, eventually, perhaps even a method for rejuvenating the brain's youthful ability to learn, remember and heal itself. Advertisement When we're young, the brain is constantly reshaping itself and making new synaptic connections based on learning and experiences, in a process known as neuroplasticity . The brain lose some of this youthful plasticity as we age, and we become less capable of making new neural connections. Rewiring the brain. The scientists transplanted embryonic neurons that express the neurotransmitter GABA from the brains of younger mice into those of older mice with a major visual impairment. GABA, which tends to decrease with age, is a chemical in the brain that helps with important functions such as vision and motor control and may play a role in controlling fear and anxiety . In the study, the researchers used GABA transplantation to repair the visual system in a group of mice with amblyopia, a condition that prevents one eye from focusing . In a young brain, the visual system is being constantly rewired by new visual experiences -- but when that process is impaired during youth, amblyopia can result. Advertisement The GABA neurons increased plasticity in the brains of adult mice, allowing for extensive rewiring and the creation of new neural connections -- comparable to that which occurs during important stages of brain development. \"We found that the transplanted cells dramatically enhanced the plasticity of neuronal connections in the host visual cortex,\" Dr. Sunil Gandhi, the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"The new plasticity occurred in the recipients when the donor animal's critical period would have happened. So, in effect, we rejuvenated the plasticity of connections in the recipient brain.\" Transplanting the GABA neurons restored normal eyesight in the mice -- suggesting that a wealth of new brain connections had been formed. Advertisement \u201cSeveral weeks after transplantation... the amblyopic mice started to see with normal visual acuity,\u201d Melissa Davis, a postdoctoral fellow and another author of the study, said in a statement . Oh, to be young again. The findings are a major first step towards scientists' ability to rehabilitate and rejuvenate the brain through procedures that activate plasticity in older, injured or developmentally impaired brains. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

While this isn't quite a fountain of youth for the brain, the researchers are optimistic that the findings could open up new treatment possibilities for a range of neurological disorders, as well as avenues for future research to increase our understanding of how the brain develops. Advertisement Through transplanting GABA neurons, scientists may be able to help treat developmental brain disorders like autism and schizophrenia, and to help the brain recover from injury. \"The findings raise the promise of using GABA neuron transplantation to enhance the retraining of the adult brain following injury,\" Gandhi said.

Your Dog Can Get Alzheimer's Too Your Dog Can Get Alzheimer's Too By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 1, 2015, 07:35 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT As your dog reaches old age, you might expect to contend with veterinary complaints like hip dysplasia or even cancer. But here's one you aren't as likely to expect: Alzheimer's disease. According to veterinarian Lee Harris, the condition is surprisingly common. At his veterinary practice in Southern California, he's seen an increase in chronic conditions such as obesity, arthritis and dementia. Advertisement \"Really, our brains are not that different from dogs\u2019,\" Harris wrote in The Washington Post. \"The cellular changes of canine cognitive dysfunction would be recognizable under the microscope to any human brain pathologist: Plaques of beta amyloid \u2014 protein fragments believed to be the result of 'oxidative stress' \u2014 lead to distinctive 'neurofibrillary tangles' within the damaged nerve cells, and shrinkage of the brain appears in areas where memories are made and behaviors are shaped.\" The technical term for the condition, Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome, has only more recently become recognized as a disease in dogs. Now, it is estimated that more than 50 percent of dogs over the age of 10 will exhibit symptoms of cognitive decline. Of course, the symptoms will present themselves somewhat differently than they do in humans. Dementia may cause trained dog to go to the bathroom in the house, to become disoriented in the home or yard, or to forget which door to use to get to the yard. Advertisement \"Although dementia is almost never fatal on its own, cognitive dysfunction and physical health problems are a debilitating combination,\" Harris writes in the Washington Post . Older cats, too, can suffer dementia-like symptoms, research has found. A University of Edinburgh study found that half of cats over the age of 15, and one in four cats between the ages of 11 and 14, suffer from Alzheimer's, which may cause them to become confused or aggressive. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Cocktails at The Carlyle With NASA's Senior-most Scientist on Origins of Life, Andrew Pohorille Andrew Pohorille did not disappoint with revelations that there is a certain factor to life that so far cannot be captured in the lab, i.e., life is not purely a technical matter, and that he does not expect that \"we\" will find life anywhere else in the solar system, including Mars.

I made my way from the train west across Park Avenue to 77th Street, passing the building made famous by Redford as the CIA's American Literary Historical Society , then made a turn south to The Carlyle Hotel. I had a meeting there, in Bemelmans' wonderland of murals with the senior-most scientist on origins of life at NASA, Andrew Pohorille -- a vibrant man with the wiry physique of a tennis player -- who did not disappoint with revelations that there is a certain factor to life that so far cannot be captured in the lab, i.e., life is not purely a technical matter, and that he does not expect that \"we\" will find life anywhere else in the solar system, including Mars. Startling admissions coming from someone that senior at NASA (and considering NASA's budget for explorations), even if made over a Passion Royale while on a cultural visit to New York to see a play, a little ballet and celebrate his birthday. Pohorille advised by email that he was traveling to the city, giving two weeks' notice, and suggested we meet to discuss origin of life. I proposed meeting at the Simons Foundation exoplanet tea and lecture followed by a drink. He preferred a more private situation, dinner perhaps. We settled on cocktails at Bemelmans. Advertisement I was flattered that he chose to interrupt his personal holiday for a meeting with me, but was naturally curious why. Pohorille said he was not looking for a \"man-bites-dog\" story, which he terms all news stories. But I ultimately decided the encounter was of public interest. Andrew's wife Joanna joined us for drinks. She agreed with her husband about an elusive X-factor to life. Joanna is a cognitive psychologist specializing in risk-taking analysis, behavioral economics. The two have written a couple of papers together on the subject. Both Andrew and Joanna are natives of Poland. Andrew came to the US as a child at age six and has retained his charming accent. Joanna left Poland when the two married 18 years ago. Advertisement I hadn't seen Andrew Pohorille for two years. Pohorille divides his time between NASA (80%) where he co-chairs the Origin of Life Focus Group and the University of California, San Francisco (20%) where he is a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry . We first met at the 2013 Princeton Origins of Life conference co-sponsored by NASA, where I discovered him alone, at the coffee station , having escaped from the lecture hall. Pohorille is not an RNA world enthusiast and the Princeton presentations were largely all about RNA. He told me at Bemelmans that he never thought I'd follow through with a book on origin of life . Pohorille is now even less enthused about the RNA world since Princeton and said there were also fewer scientists currently pursuing that line of research. He also thinks the answer to origin of life is not about a thermodynamic factor -- which he says smacks of creationism. And he adds that scientists have so far not found viruses in meteorites, i.e., no nucleic acid. Advertisement I mentioned the recent lukewarm New York Times story about origin of life research and Pohorille agreed not only with the Times assessment but with comments made earlier to me by biochemist Pier Luigi Luisi that we need all new \"mindstorms,\" because nothing much has happened since Miller-Urey yet scientists keep pursuing the same lines of investigation. Pohorille, however, does think working with amino acids makes sense. His personal view is that the way forward is somewhere between Steve Benner 's research and Jack Szostak 's. We did not address Fermilab's quest to discover whether we live in a 2-D world , a hologram. So why doesn't NASA sponsor a series of origins of life roundtables on Charlie Rose to \"chew the fat,\" as Harry Lonsdale once put it? -- I asked Andrew Pohorille once again. Who knows where the next great idea can come from, what DIY (Do It Yourself) scientist of whatever stripe gets inspired? Has a eureka moment.

Missing Comet Lander 'Philae' Finally Located After Long Search The hunt is over! By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Sep 6, 2016, 02:43 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Almost two years after it made history by becoming the first spacecraft ever to set down on a comet, the European Space Agency\u2019s Philae lander has finally been located . Photos taken Sept. 2, 2016, by the agency\u2019s Rosetta space probe show the main body of the lander and two of its three legs wedged in a dark crack on the surface of the smaller of the two lobes that make up Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta successfully deployed Philae onto Comet 67P on Nov. 12, 2014 , after a 10-year space journey. But Philae disappointed scientists when it entered \u201chibernation\u201d mode just days later because it had landed in a shady spot that caused depletion of its solar-powered batteries. Exactly where on the surface the lander was located had been unknown. Advertisement \u201cThis remarkable discovery comes at the end of a long, painstaking search,\u201d Patrick Martin, ESA\u2019s Rosetta Mission Manager, said in a written statement. \u201cWe were beginning to think that Philae would remain lost forever.\u201d The discovery of Philae\u2019s location doesn\u2019t mean the lander can be awakened. But scientists say it could help them make better sense of the data it beamed back before it went to sleep, the BBC reported. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Betelgeuse Supernova Astronomers have been waiting for this for a long time, and at some time in the not so distant future the brilliant red star in the constellation Orion will explode. What will it look like? By Dr. Sten Odenwald, Contributor Astronomer, NASA Heliophysics Education Consortium Astronomer, NASA Heliophysics Education Consortium Feb 2, 2015, 01:43 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Astronomers have been waiting for this for a long time, and at some time in the not so distant future the brilliant red star in the constellation Orion will explode. What will it look like? Betelgeuse is so big and close its surface can be resolved with the Hubble Space Telescope! What we know. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star located about 590 light years from Earth. If you were to replace our sun with this star, its outer surface would be located at about the orbit of Jupiter, but it is a variable star and its diameter has been directly measured to vary from about the orbit of Earth to the orbit of Saturn. It has an average luminosity of about 120,000 times our sun's output. It's mass is between 8 and 17 times the mass of our sun. It is surrounded by ejected shells of gas that extend out to 1400 AU (1 AU = Earth's orbit distance from the sun), with a plasma gas shell extending to 200 AU. The dust shell indicates that Betelgeuse has been going through a period of mass loss that may amount to 3% of our sun's mass every 10,000 years. It is no longer supplying most of its energy by fusing hydrogen to helium in its core, but is now in an advanced stage of life where hydrogen fusion is occurring in a shell surrounding the core. The helium ash is forming a large dense core about the size of Earth which will eventually get hot enough to fuse helium into heavier elements. By that time it will be within a few hundred thousand years of its end-of-life. For a star of this mass, it will explode in what astronomers classify as a Type II supernova. It will leave behind a neutron star with a mass of 1.5 times our sun, which will become a pulsar. Computer models don't give us a very accurate prediction of when this is likely to happen, but it could be anytime between 100,000 years and several million years from now. So what will it look like? Some years ago, I did a few back of the envelope calculations and came up with a brief post-explosion scenario at my online site The Astronomy Caf\u00e9 . Here's what I said back in 1997, with some added information here and there. Advertisement \"If we just consider what could happen as a result of its expanding shell of gas, typical shell velocities are about 10,000 kilometers/sec. The shell would arrive here about 100,000 years after we see the star brightening. The shell would carry about half the mass of Betelgeuse or perhaps 10 times the mass of the Sun, which equals about 2 x 10^58 protons. The flow of these particles in a shell with a radius of 590 light years would be about 100,000 protons per second per square centimeter. The solar wind 'flux', by comparison is about 300 million protons/sec/square centimeter at the Earth's orbit. Ram pressure is defined as density time velocity-squared. The Betelgeuse flux is traveling at perhaps 10,000 kilometers/sec compared to the 450 kilometers/sec of the solar wind. Its density is thousands of times less than the solar wind, so the Betelgeuse flux has an effective pressure that is (1/1000)(10,000/450)^2 = 0.5 times the solar wind or less, and spread out over a region much larger than the size of the solar system. This pressure will probably not be enough to cause the heliopause of our sun at 120 AU to change noticeably and so our solar system will be protected from the Betelgeuse flow because we are literally living inside a magnetic bottle due to our sun's solar wind! There is also the x-ray flux to contend with. Inside this shell, there is a bubble of plasma consisting of very hot and energetic electrons and magnetic fields, which produce copious amounts of X-ray light. We would be subjected to this x-ray flux for 10s of thousands of years until the expanding supernova remnant has aged sufficiently to quench this production mechanism. These X-rays, of the 'soft' variety' would not get down to the Earth's surface thanks to atmospheric shielding, but travelers in interplanetary space would need some additional shielding from the secondary electrons generated as these x-rays strike the skin of their spacecraft and liberate additional electrons. \" Looking at the night sky, the surface brightness of this shell will be so small that within a few decades after the explosion, you will not be able to see this nebula approaching and enveloping our solar system unless you had the right equipment. It will not look like some ghostly green aurora filling the skies. Advertisement Not much has changed in the details of these predictions, except that we have studied many more of these Type II supernova explosions since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra and other resources. The Neutrino Pulse. The core detonation will most likely generate a brief pulse of neutrinos that will reach Earth hours before we visibly start to see the star brighten. Then over the course of several weeks it will brighten until it reaches a magnitude of about -12, which is about the same brightness as the full moon. But in a spot of light that your eye can't resolve, it will actually hurt to look at it and may even cause retinal damage. The most recent Type-II supernova called SN1987A, was spotted in the Large Magellanic cloud in 1987 at a distance of 168,000 light years. At the distance of Betelgeuse, it would take the SN1987A expanding shock wave about 20,000 years to reach our solar system. Supernova 1987A remnant viewed by the Hubble Space Telescope. The ring is a light year across, and was created by the detonation shock wave reaching the inner edge of a dust shell ejected over 20,000 years ago. Learning from Example. SN 1987A produced a neutrino pulse of 10^58 neutrinos, which was reduced to only 24 detected on Earth due to the inverse-square law at the distance to SN1987A, and the fact that neutrinos interact very weekly with our detector matter. If we were to move this to Betelgeuse, we would get a pulse of 24(168,000/590)^2 = 2 million detected neutrinos! This is utterly harmless to humans, but will alert astronomers that Betelgeuse is about to blow. The Crab Nebula, some 960 years after detonation, is surrounded by an expanding cloud of plasma that is now 6 light years in radius. It is the strongest x-ray and radio source in the sky after our sun. The cloud is expanding at about 1,500 km/sec or 3.5 million miles per hour. It is located 6,500 light years from Earth. At the distance of Betelgeuse, by 960 years this shell would be 14 times the diameter of the full moon! At about 95,000 years after detonation, this slow-moving plasma will finally reach the solar system. From then-on, we will be inside the volume of intense x-rays and high-energy particles.

But the good news is that the supernova shell of the famous and much older Cygnus Loop supernova remnant is at a distance of about 1,400 light years and has a diameter of 150 light years 8,000 years after the explosion. Its shell has already broken up into numerous filaments and a lot of empty gaps in-between. At the distance of Betelgeuse, this shell would reach our solar system after about 63,000 years; not much different than our estimate for the Crab nebula-type shell. It would occupy about 2/3 of the entire sky centered on Betelgeuse. The Cygnus Loop supernova remnant showing the hot and cold regions as seen in x-ray light (Credit:NASA/ROSAT) Advertisement So, we can expect that about 100,000 years after Betelgeuse detonates, and after watching the expanding cloud get bigger for millennia and then seeing it fade away from view, we will have a new reminder of its presence. The plasma cloud and x-rays will enter our solar system and force us to adapt to this new interplanetary situation for the next hundred millennia or more, not because of the particles but because of the x-rays. The high-energy particles will only increase the cosmic ray background in our solar system, and will be of too-low an energy to penetrate our Earth's magnetic field...so no cancer risk unless you are an astronaut. The bottom line... But who knows what we will be doing by then! We might have abandoned space travel millennia before the Betelgeuse supernova, or we may not even care because our technology and biology is now utterly immune from such trivial space hazards! Either way, the Betelgeuse Supernova will find us a dramatically different species than what we are now.

Bad News, Everyone: You'll Have To Wait An Extra Second For 2016 To End Blame the leap second. \ud83d\ude15 By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Dec 28, 2016, 04:14 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The Prague Astronomical Clock, a medieval clock that's more than 600 years old. An extra second will be added to world clocks at the end of 2016. Godong via Getty Images Can\u2019t wait for 2016 to end? Bad news: You\u2019ll have to live in it for one second longer. At 6:59:59 p.m. Eastern time on Dec. 31, 2016, we\u2019ll have a \u201cleap second,\u201d where an extra second will be added to world clocks as an adjustment to keep time in sync with the Earth\u2019s rotation relative to the sun. \u201cHistorically, time was based on the mean rotation of the Earth relative to celestial bodies and the second was defined in this reference frame,\u201d explained Geoff Chester, a public affairs officer at the U.S. Naval Observatory, which announced the 2016 leap second in July. Advertisement \u201cHowever, the invention of atomic clocks defined a much more precise \u2018atomic\u2019 timescale and a second that is independent of Earth\u2019s rotation,\u201d he said. As a result, leap seconds have been added as needed at irregular intervals since 1972, to reconcile the difference between the two systems. A whopping 10 seconds were added to the clock that first year. While there\u2019s a chance timekeepers may some day have to subtract a second, that has yet to happen. Advertisement If we didn\u2019t add leap seconds, eventually the celestial bodies would end up way out of whack with our Earthly timepieces. Per National Geographic, we\u2019d face a two- to three-minute difference by 2100, and a full 30-minute discrepancy if we put off changing our clocks until 2700. Practically speaking, the additional second should have little effect on the average person\u2019s day-to-day life, though it is critically important for many digital systems we\u2019ve come to rely on, such as telecommunications. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Face-Aging Software Presents a Terrible (and Fascinating) Social Dilemma How-Old.net, a website that purports to estimate users' age based on a picture of their face, went viral last week, garnering tens of thousands of hits within the first few hours of its release. By Daniel A. Yudkin, Contributor PhD candidate in Social Psychology at NYU. PhD candidate in Social Psychology at NYU.

If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. How-Old.net, a website that purports to estimate users' age based on a picture of their face, went viral last week, garnering tens of thousands of hits within the first few hours of its release. The success of the Microsoft-made site, whose algorithm bases its judgments on facial features such as skin creases and laugh lines, showcases more than just technology's ever-increasing ability to harness information in marvelous new ways. It also highlights several fascinating aspects of human nature. First, there's the rule which by now has surely become axiomatic amongst those attempting to create popular sites, lists, and apps: tell people about themselves. Nothing sparkles more in the eyes of Internet users than the quiz that breaks down their sex life, the horoscope that proffers career or relationship advice, or the chart that displays how they measure up against peers in wealth or beauty. Psychologists call this the \"self-assessment motive,\" and research suggests it is basic to our nature. In fact, people will seek out information about themselves even when the news isn't all good. This may explain the popularity of dating apps like Tinder, even among those with no intention of ever following through on a genuine rendezvous: there's something thrilling not just about meting out judgments with the casual swipe of a finger, but also about being subjected oneself to the same standards of evaluation. Advertisement Microsoft's site, though, taps a motive that runs deeper, perhaps, than even those that inform users of their wealth or attractiveness. The question of aging--of how well we're weathering the passage of time--is one which, though it goes largely ignored by those whose baby fat still pads the face, becomes increasingly salient as the vicissitudes of late nights and bright days take their toll. How else can we explain the exorbitant demonstrations of financial excess that reach at least one of their most horrifying peaks in the prices of overhyped anti-age creams and ointments that grace the shelves of beauty parlors in those neighborhoods wealthy enough to afford them? As a species wise enough to understand our own transience and yet still unable to do anything about it, we are condemned to spend every morning looking at ourselves miserably in the bathroom mirror until we manage to alight upon some favorable standard of comparison (a craggy friend, a long-lived aunt) to mollify our discontent. It's for this reason that, for as many users as visited the site in its opening days, there were undoubtedly just as many shrieks of glee as there were sighs of despair as people learned the algorithm had placed them a few years short or long of their actual benchmark. \"I got 3 years older than I actually am on that photo age thing,\" someone wrote on Twitter, \"and I'm going to be upset for the rest of the day now.\" Advertisement It's a troubling fact of logic: half of us look older than the average person our age. What are we to do? Perhaps we should take seriously the line uttered by the character Jessa in Lena Dunham's HBO show \"Girls\": \"I am going to look 50 when I'm 30, I'm going to be so f---ing fat...know why? Because I am going to be full of experiences.\" This philosophy flips the youth-centric approach on its head, espousing instead the creed that the unblemished face is the face of innocence, and therefore the face of ingenuousness, inexperience, and na\u00efvet\u00e9. Of course, there are many behaviors that will mature a face without conferring any of the compensatory wisdom. An unhealthy diet or a lack of exercise, for instance, is sure give the appearance of age beyond one's years. The same goes for excessive drug or alcohol use, or too many hours in the tanning salon. But if the goal of life is to make the most of a limited number of days, then surely it must be the case that some of our most precious experiences would have to be sacrificed for the sake of a porcelain complexion. \"Make sure you eat a healthy dose of antioxidants every day,\" we can imagine the doctor telling the age-obsessed patient, \"And cut down on all that smiling!\" We would do well to remind ourselves that the goal is not to look as young as possible, but to look as young as possible for the amount of world we've seen. We should be cognizant of the mechanical nature of the body, and allow this awareness to redound to respect, but we may also benefit from remembering that the body is meant for a purpose, that is, to engage with the physical and the social world, and that wear and tear is an inevitable and desirable consequence of it having served that purpose well. Like Velveteen Rabbits and good leather shoes, some things get better with age. Advertisement By contrast, other things, like humanity's tortured relationship with self-knowledge, never change. The popularity of this website is just another entry in a long line of evidence to this effect. There's an ongoing battle in our minds between the desire to learn the right things and the nice things. Usually (but not always), the latter wins. Oftentimes, we will want the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth--so long as it's good. {written with Yaacov Trope} Originally posted at The Qualiast .

You Should Know How The Male Brain Reacts To Handling A Gun The evolutionary psychology of mass shootings. Frank T. McAndrew, Professor of Psychology, Knox College \u2014 The Conversation Dec 4, 2015, 07:23 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Men commit over 85% of all homicides, 91% of all same-sex homicides and 97% of all same-sex homicides in which the victim and killer aren\u2019t related to each other. These startling statistics are driven home with each new mass shooting (though the most recent tragedy in San Bernardino, California is a bit unusual in that a married couple were the shooters). Advertisement In any event, politicians and the media are trotting out the usual suspects to explain the tragedy, whether it\u2019s the lack of attention paid to mental illness or the easy availability of guns. But these explanations dance around the big questions: why is there always a man behind these shootings? And why is it almost always a young man? Evolutionary psychology can provide some clues. Precarious manhood Psychologists Joseph Vandello and Jennifer Bosson have coined the term \u201c precarious manhood \u201d to describe a dilemma that only men seem to face. Advertisement In a nutshell, they argue that \u201cmanhood\u201d \u2013 however an individual male\u2019s culture might define it \u2013 is a status that must be continually earned. And one\u2019s self-worth is tied to being perceived as a \u201creal man.\u201d It\u2019s precarious because it can be easily lost \u2013 especially if the man fails to measure up to the relentless challenges that life throws at him, be they tests of physical bravery, or competition with other men for respect and status. When I introduce this concept to my male students, they instantly recognize what I\u2019m talking about. But when I ask the women if there\u2019s a female equivalent, I\u2019m often met with confused looks. (Some do note that the inability to have a child could be a threat to womanhood.) Indeed, it quickly becomes clear in the ensuing discussion that \u201cmanhood\u201d is more precarious than \u201cwomanhood.\u201d Advertisement The roots of this male dilemma reside deep in our prehistoric past. Throughout the animal kingdom, the sex that invests the least in the reproduction of offspring (almost always males) competes among themselves for sexual access to mates. Historically, powerful men have always enjoyed greater sexual access to women than than men lower in the pecking order, and violence can often be traced to this grim struggle for status. Anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon spent years studying the Yanomamo people of South America. He discovered that men who had killed other men acquired significantly more wives than men who hadn\u2019t killed anyone. And by all indications, a man\u2019s status in the group was often dependent upon how believable his threats of physical violence were. In different cultures, the male \u201cquest for dominance\u201d may play out in different ways. Regardless, it is clearly a universal motivating principle among males, with the achievement of dominance satisfying and rewarding for those who attain it. As scholar Jonathan Gottschall put it : Advertisement To physically dominate another man is intoxicating. And so, violence committed against the right people at the right time became a ticket to social success. Jim Corwin via Getty Images Competitive drives For sound evolutionary reasons, younger men find themselves especially concerned with status and dominance. Advertisement In early human societies, competitive success or failure in early adulthood determined a man\u2019s standing in a social group for the rest of his life . It wasn\u2019t possible to simply hit the \u201creset\u201d button and join another group, so what happened during the teen years mattered a lot. For this reason, high-risk competition between young males provided an opportunity for \u201cshowing off\u201d the abilities needed to acquire resources, exhibit strength and meet any challenges to one\u2019s status. Consequently, heroic or even recklessly daredevil behavior was rewarded with status and respect \u2013 assuming, of course, that the young man survived the ordeal. Today, the widespread promotion of sport in our culture undoubtedly developed as a constructive alternative for dealing with the proclivities of young males that evolved in a very different time. In a legally sanctioned gladiatorial arena, young men are able to exhibit the same skills \u2013 throwing, clubbing, running, wrestling, tackling, hand-eye coordination \u2013 that would have made them successful fighters or hunters in the ancestral environment. Advertisement Young Male Syndrome It\u2019s no secret that most people fear violent behavior by young men more than violent behavior by older men. There\u2019s a sound basis for this fear. In fact, the tendency of young men to engage in risky, aggressive behavior prompted the Canadian psychologists Margo Wilson and Martin Daly to give it a name: Young Male Syndrome . The duo studied the relationship among age, sex and homicide victimization in the United States in 1975. They found that the likelihood of a woman being a murder victim doesn\u2019t change dramatically throughout the course of her life. The pattern for the males, on the other hand, is striking. At age 10, males and females have an equal probability of being murdered. But by the time men are into their 20\u2019s, they become six times more likely to be murdered. Advertisement Consistent with Wilson and Daly\u2019s data, 87% of the 598 homicide victims in the city of Chicago in 2003 were males, and 64% of the victims were between the ages of 17 and 30. The likelihood of being the victim of lethal violence peaks for men between the late teens and late 20\u2019s, before steadily declining for the rest of their lives. Nature fuels the fires of male violence by equipping young men with the high levels of testosterone necessary to get the job done. USO via Getty Images Advertisement Studies on chimpanzees \u2013 our closest primate relative \u2013 have shown that high-ranking male chimpanzees exhibit the highest levels of aggression and the highest levels of testosterone. Furthermore, all adult male chimpanzees experience their highest testosterone levels when they\u2019re in the presence of females who are ovulating. This is associated only with higher levels of aggression \u2013 not significant increases in actual sexual activity. Researchers such as myself who study the relationship between testosterone and aggression in humans have concluded that testosterone-fueled violence is more likely to occur when males are competing with other males, or when the social status of a male is challenged in some way. The increased testosterone facilitates whatever competitive behaviors are needed to meet the challenge, which could mean physical violence. Many studies have shown that testosterone levels in males rise and fall according to whether the individual wins or loses in competitive sports, like tennis and wrestling \u2013 even chess. Advertisement Sports fans experience the same spike watching sports, which helps explain the violence and destructive rioting that can take place after big games (win or lose). A Ukranian soccer fan readies to lob a brick towards police separating them from fans of another team prior to their Europa League match. SERGEI SUPINSKY via Getty Images Adding guns to the mix So how do guns figure into this violent equation? In 2006 I coauthored a laboratory study on men\u2019s responses to guns in the journal Psychological Science with my colleague Tim Kasser and one of our students. We demonstrated that males who interacted with a handgun showed a greater increase in testosterone levels and more aggressive behavior than males who interacted with the board game Mouse Trap. Advertisement In the study, each participant dismantled either a gun or the mousetrap, handled its components and then wrote instructions for how to assemble the objects. Then we gave them the opportunity to put hot sauce into water that was going to be consumed by another person. The participants who handled the gun put in significantly more hot sauce \u2013 and were also more likely to express disappointment after learning that no one was going to actually drink the concoction. Thus, cues tied to threats often won\u2019t result in aggressive responses unless testosterone is involved. Elliot Rodger, the disturbed college student whose violent 2014 rampage through Santa Barbara, California, was foretold in a chilling YouTube video , clearly experienced a testosterone surge upon purchasing his first handgun. \u201cAfter I picked up the handgun,\u201d he explained, \u201cI brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power. Who\u2019s the alpha male now, bitches?\u201d Advertisement Mass shooter = low-dominant loser? Young male violence is most likely to be initiated by young men who don\u2019t command respect from others. They\u2019ll often feel like slighted outcasts, deprived of what they want or feel they deserve. British clinical psychologist Paul Gilbert has developed something he calls the Social Attention Holding Theory . According to Gilbert, we compete with each other to have other people pay attention to us; when other people take notice, we build status. The increased status that comes from having others attend to us leads to all kinds of positive emotions. But persistently being ignored by others produces much darker emotions \u2013 especially envy and anger. It\u2019s no mystery why the media will often describe mass shooters and terrorists as misfits or loners. In many cases, they are. Advertisement Nicolas Henin was a Frenchman who was held hostage by ISIS for ten months. Here\u2019s how he described his young, murderous, Jihadi captors: They present themselves to the public as superheroes, but away from the camera are a bit pathetic in many ways: street kids drunk on ideology and power. In France we have a saying \u2013 stupid and evil. I found them more stupid than evil. That is not to understate the murderous potential of stupidity. Apparently, a lack of attention from others results in a lack of status, resulting in a lack of access to women. Combined with a young man\u2019s testosterone, it creates a toxic, combustible mix. Advertisement There may not be much we can do to change the structure of the young male mind that evolved over the course of millions of years. However, ignoring or denying its existence doesn\u2019t do us any favors. This story was originally published by The Conversation .

The Only Thing Better Than A Double Rainbow Is This Double Eclipse What does it mean? By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Sep 3, 2016, 01:03 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A NASA observatory witnessed an incredible double eclipse this week when the Earth and the moon crossed in front of its view of the sun. Video and images recorded Thursday by the Solar Dynamics Observatory show the Earth completely eclipse the sun just as the moon begins to cross into view. As the Earth eclipse ends, the SDO footage captures the final stages of the lunar eclipse as well. Advertisement NASA explains how to tell the difference between the Earth and the moon in the images: In the SDO data, you can tell Earth and the moon\u2019s shadows apart by their edges: Earth\u2019s is fuzzy, while the moon\u2019s is sharp and distinct. This is because Earth\u2019s atmosphere absorbs some of the sun\u2019s light, creating an ill-defined edge. On the other hand, the moon has no atmosphere, producing a crisp horizon. Now check out this amazing photo: A fuzzy Earth and crisp moon block the view of the sun. NASA A blog for the SDO mission also pointed out the view of the phenomenon from the ground in southern Africa, which created an annular eclipse , also known as a \u201cring of fire.\u201d Advertisement Solar physicist Ryan Milligan shared the picture below from his travels in Tanzania, according to the blog.

Binge-Watching Netflix Is Making You Feel Lonely And Depressed Binge-Watching Netflix Is Making You Feel Lonely And Depressed By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 31, 2015, 10:51 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT PARIS, FRANCE - SEPTEMBER 19: In this photo illustration the Netflix logo is reflected in the eye of a woman on September 19, 2014 in Paris, France. Netflix September 15 launched service in France, the first of six European countries planned in the coming months. (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) Settling in on the couch with a bottle of wine and an entire season of Friends may seem like a perfectly enjoyable way to spend the weekend, but regular binge-watching sessions may be a sign of mental health problems. A new study from the University of Texas at Austin found that the more lonely and depressed people are, the more likely they are to binge-watch television. Advertisement The researchers conducted a survey on over 300 millennials, asking how often and how much they watched TV, how often they felt lonely, and examining various measures of depression and self-regulation. Those who lacked self-regulatory skills reported being unable to stop clicking \"next\" even though they knew there were other things they needed to do, indicating a lack of self-control. The data also showed that feelings of loneliness and depression were directly correlated with binge-watching. Loneliness, depression and lack of self-control have also been implicated in other types of binge behavior, such as heavy drinking and excessive social media use . \"Even though some people argue that binge-watching is a harmless addiction, findings from our study suggest that binge-watching should no longer be viewed this way,\" study author Yoon Hi Sung said in a statement. \"Physical fatigue and problems such as obesity and other health problems are related to binge-watching and they are a cause for concern. When binge-watching becomes rampant, viewers may start to neglect their work and their relationships with others. Even though people know they should not, they have difficulty resisting the desire to watch episodes continuously.\" Advertisement Previous research has shown this to be the case. A 2013 marketing study found that 71 percent ofge-watchers had intended to watch just one or two episodes, and then ended up getting sucked in. The research also found that more than half of binge watchers prefer to watch at home alone. The research will be presented at the International Communication Association Conference in Puerto Rico this May.
