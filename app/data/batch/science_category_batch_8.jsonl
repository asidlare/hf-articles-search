Stephen Hawking Predicts Humans Won't Last Another 1,000 Years On Earth Stephen Hawking Has Dire Prediction For Humanity By James Gerken Green Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 28, 2015, 11:49 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Renowned British physicist and author Stephen Hawking has a dire prediction for humanity: We will not survive another millennium unless we colonize another planet. \" I don't think we will survive another 1,000 years without escaping beyond our fragile planet,\" Hawking said in remarks delivered at Sydney's Opera House last weekend. His addresses on Saturday and Sunday were his first in Australia , but were delivered via hologram from his office in Britain. Advertisement We must continue to go into space \u201cfor the future of humanity,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to encourage public interest in space.\" Hawking has made similar comments in the past, suggesting that technological improvements in space travel could make colonizing a new planet feasible in the future. \"Sooner or later disasters such as an asteroid collision or a nuclear war could wipe us all out,\" he told BBC radio in 2006. \"But once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe.\" In 2010, he said humanity's future \"must be\" in space . Hawking also answered several pre-submitted questions during his Sydney appearance, including a surprising one about Zayn Malik's departure from pop band One Direction . \"Finally, a question about something important,\" he said. Hawking used the opportunity to share his thoughts on the possibility of multiple universes. Advertisement \"One day there may well be proof of multiple universes,\" he said. \"It would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies another different universe. And in that universe, Zayn is still in One Direction.\" Watch a full video of Hawking's remarks below: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

The Surprising Way Ships' Wakes Could Help Ease Global Warming It's all about making the Earth's surface more reflective. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 3, 2016, 09:49 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The wakes of large ships could be used to curb global warming, scientists argue. Stewart Sutton/Getty Images The shipping industry gets blamed for its share of environmental ills, from air and water pollution to collisions that kill whales and other marine animals. But in a new paper published last week in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, scientists argue that the wakes of big ocean-going vessels might actually be used to curb global warming . Advertisement The scientists say that dramatically extending the lifetimes of the foamy wakes (and making them a bit brighter) would boost the Earth's surface reflectivity (what scientists call albedo ) and reduce the extent to which sunlight warms our planet. Wake bubbles typically pop within a matter of minutes. But \"if we could make the bubbles in the wake last for 10 days, then I believe this scheme could potentially reduce global warming to some extent,\" Dr. Julia A. Crook , a research fellow in the Institute for Climate & Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds in England, told The Huffington Post in an email. Crook and her co-authors maintain that their climate model shows the scheme could bring a 0.5-degree Celsius reduction in the Earth's average surface temperature by 2069, helping to offset the 2-degree warming expected by then. Advertisement According to Crook, the effect is comparable to those achieved by other so-called geoengineering schemes that have been proposed in recent years. Of course, those bubbles won't resist popping just because we want them to. The scheme calls for the ocean-going ships to pump out a stream of chemicals known as surfactants as they move along. Surfactants help prevent popping by affecting the surface tension of water -- at the same time making the wakes a bit whiter than they would be ordinarily. But it's not clear whether the scheme would be safe for marine life. And then there's the matter of its effect on air quality. Advertisement \"Previous research suggests surfactants reduce the amount of CO2 uptake by the ocean, which would mean by adding surfactant we might cause atmospheric CO2 to go up,\" Crook said. \"But by how much and whether the resulting warming from the extra CO2 would outweigh the increased albedo is unknown. This could be a show-stopper.\" Dr. David Keith, a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard and a noted expert on geoengineering, said real-world feasibility and cost are other key issues. \"Nobody doubts that if you can make the bubbles last it makes the sea whiter,\" Keith said. \"That\u2019s easy. The hard part is whether you can make the bubbles persist and do it in sea water.\" Advertisement To fully assess the scheme's cost, safety and feasibility, he said, it will take more than a climate model. It will take real-world experiments.

Here's How Astronauts On The ISS Will Celebrate Thanksgiving Irradiated smoked turkey, anyone? By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 25, 2015, 03:49 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Happy Thanksgiving Spacegiving! How do astronauts celebrate Turkey Day on the International Space Station? According to a new NASA video featuring astronauts and Expedition 45 crew members Scott Kelly and Kjell Lindgren, it\u2019s going to be an out-of-this-world day on the ISS -- full of football-watching, time with family and a Thanksgiving feast. The astronauts\u2019 plans may sound similar to your Earthbound ones, but as the video shows, there are some critical differences . Advertisement Here, for instance, is what their Thanksgiving spread -- which includes pouches of irradiated smoked turkey, candied yams and rehydratable corn -- will look like: \u201cMan, they are delicious,\u201d said Kelly rather unconvincingly as he sampled some yam. Advertisement On Thanksgiving, the ISS astronauts will get the day off, and a bit of extra time to speak with their families on Earth. They\u2019ll also get to watch some football, though it\u2019ll be \u201clater in the afternoon for us,\u201d said Kelly. Still, though the astronauts are far from home and their Thanksgiving grub looks less than appetizing, both Kelly and Lindgren stressed how thankful they are for the opportunity to be on the ISS. \u201cWe are incredibly thankful for the opportunity to be \u2026 living in this amazing orbiting laboratory, a physical manifestation of what is possible when the great countries of the world work together with communication, cooperation and collaboration toward peaceful means,\u201d Lindgren said. Advertisement \u201cBeing on the Space Station here and looking down at our incredibly beautiful planet gives us a different perspective on what it means to be citizens of planet Earth,\u201d Kelly added. Lindgren is slated to return to Earth on Dec. 11 after spending about five months in space . Kelly, however, is not due to return till March, when his year-long mission aboard the ISS will come to an end. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Right Kind Of Daydreaming A wandering mind gets a bad rap --but if done right, it may have benefits. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jul 25, 2016, 05:59 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Is your daydreaming mostly unintentional, or is it deliberate? That could make a difference, researchers say. Thomas Barwick via Getty Images When it comes to daydreaming, there may be two very different ways of letting your mind wander \u2015 and if that\u2019s the case, you want to make sure you\u2019re doing it right. Daydreaming is something we all do every day. Up to 50 percent of your waking life, your mind could be floating somewhere else. This can be disturbing when you realize that researchers have linked a wandering mind to negative consequences like car accidents, poor educational performance and even unhappiness . But other research tells a different story , finding that daydreaming is also associated with creativity, social skills and, interestingly, happiness. Advertisement This apparent contradiction might actually make sense. Usually, common behaviors and emotions that are often considered negative \u2015 like boredom , for example \u2015 can actually exist for a positive reason. \u201cWe daydream so frequently that it\u2019s reasonable to assume that maybe our brains do this in a functional way,\u201d says Paul Seli, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychology at Harvard University. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s actually quite beneficial to mind wander. And there\u2019s a smaller area of research showing this is the case.\u201d In a recent article published in Trends in Cognitive Science , Seli and his colleagues explore this possibility, proposing that there are two types of mind wandering: on one hand, an unintentional breakdown of focus that can be harmful, and on the other, an intentional and deliberate disengagement that can actually be productive. Advertisement The Wandering Mind Sometimes you are perfectly capable of sustaining your focus but choose to daydream about, say, your summer vacation. Other times, despite your best efforts to concentrate, random thoughts keep popping up in your head. One type of daydreaming involves an intentional shift in focus (\u201cI\u2019d rather think about this right now\u201d), and the other involves an unwelcome or unintentional interruption (\u201cWhy am I thinking about this right now?\u201d). Distinguishing between two different types of mind wandering is not new, Seli said. Leonard Giambra, a scientist who has been studying daydreaming since the early 1970s, noted this distinction. Giambra and his colleagues suggested that sometimes our minds wander because unrelated thoughts capture our attention. Other times, we deliberately shift our attention to them. However, in most studies of daydreaming, researchers have made the assumption that mind wandering is only unintentional, Seli says. He argues that it\u2019s important to make a distinction between intentional and unintentional daydreaming \u2014 because if the two behaviors are merged as one construct, it can lead to contradictory findings. Advertisement There may be entirely different neural mechanisms underlying the two types of mind wandering. For example, unintentional daydreaming may be a sign of failure in the brain\u2019s attention system, whereas intentional daydreaming occurs with some deliberate control. Giambra\u2019s studies and more recent research have shown how one type of mind wandering may be more common for people with certain disorders. People with ADHD, for example, are just as likely as people without ADHD to daydream intentionally , but are also much more likely to do it unintentionally . The same goes for people with obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, Seli said. The Benefits Of Daydreaming It\u2019s possible that most negative consequences of mind wandering are related to the unintentional kind of daydreaming, Seli said, while intentional daydreaming may provide benefits like a boost in creativity. Advertisement Some researchers noticed the benefits of daydreaming early on. In 1975, Yale psychologist Jerome L. Singer published The Inner World of Daydreaming , a product of his years of research into the phenomenon. Singer acknowledged that daydreaming could be associated with ruminative thoughts and poor attentional control, but he also identified a positive type of daydreaming characterized by playful imagery and creative thought . This is what Singer called \u201cpositive constructive daydreaming\u201d and considered to be an essential element of a healthy mind, linked to a number of positive functions. \u201cSinger noted that daydreaming can reinforce and enhance social skills, offer relief from boredom, provide opportunities for rehearsal and constructive planning, and provide an ongoing source of pleasure,\u201d writer Rebecca McMillan and psychologist Scott Kaufman wrote in a 2013 review of Singer\u2019s work. \u201cSinger describes those who engage in positive constructive daydreaming as \u2018happy daydreamers\u2019 who enjoy fantasy, vivid imagery, the use of daydreaming for future planning, and possess abundant interpersonal curiosity.\u201d Researchers have also found that while unintentional daydreaming is associated with fidgeting and acting mindlessly, deliberate daydreaming may be linked with certain aspects of mindfulness. Advertisement In a 2014 study , Seli and his colleagues at the University of Waterloo in Canada found that deliberate mind wandering was particularly connected to one factor of mindfulness, known as \u201cnonreactivity to inner experience,\u201d which involves perceiving feelings and emotions without having to react to them. \u201cThe more people intentionally mind wander in their daily life, the more mindful they are, whereas the opposite is true for unintentional mind wandering,\u201d Seli said. How To Reduce Untimely Daydreaming In unintentional mind wandering, you simply can\u2019t concentrate. But in intentional mind wandering, you may be not motivated to pay attention, and instead choose to think about something else. However, even this can be too costly in certain situations \u2014 for example, in a classroom where you need to pay attention and learn the material. Advertisement Seli\u2019s research has found that in a college classroom setting, intentional daydreaming occurs more often than unintentional daydreaming. This, Seli says, suggests that it may be more fruitful to increase students\u2019 motivation rather than try to boost their focus. Meanwhile, mindfulness training could help people reduce their unintentional daydreaming. Even though daydreaming may lower your performance in the present or make you miss your subway stop, however, it could also help in the long run . As Singer had observed and more recent research continues to suggest, daydreaming allows us to plan for and rehearse future events. When the task at hand is easy enough to perform without full attention, people take the opportunity to shift their thoughts to planning future events or solving problems. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Newborn Tigers Snuggle Up To Mama In Adorable Debut Welcome to the world, little guys! By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Mar 18, 2016, 06:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Three tiny Amur tigers were born at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Powell, Ohio, late Wednesday night. Video footage showed them snuggling up to their 11-year-old mom Irisa in a private den, away from the glare of visitors. Advertisement Zoo bosses said the trio , gender unknown, were being monitored via remote camera and \"appear to be healthy.\" \" Welcoming tiger cubs at the Zoo is always exciting but it is also a time when we proceed with cautious optimism,\" zoo president and CEO Tom Stalf said in a statement. \" Tiger cubs are very fragile at birth, however they appear to be thriving and Irisa is being an attentive mother.\" Advertisement The cubs' father is 8-year-old Jupiter, who arrived at the zoo from the Czech Republic last March as part of the European Endangered Species Program and the Association of Zoos and Aquarium's Species Survival Plan, which a ims to increase the genetic health and diversity of tigers living under human care. There are now seven Amur tigers at the Columbus zoo. However, fewer than 400 of the big cats, also known as Siberian tigers, are believed to be living in the wild in their native forests of the Russian Far East. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

No, This Isn't A CGI Stunt. It's A Real Jellyfish. It really is! By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Apr 29, 2016, 09:29 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING It's hard to believe this surreal sea creature actually exists. But this is a real jellyfish. Researchers filmed the curious animal in the depths of the western Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench , near Guam, on Sunday. It was pulsating some 2.3 miles beneath the water's surface, in the area of the world's deepest oceanic trench known as the Enigma Seamount. Advertisement Okeanos Explorer, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship, captured the astonishing sight via its remotely operated underwater vehicle, the Deep Discoverer. The footage went viral after researchers posted it on Monday. \" Scientists identified this hydromedusa as belonging to the genus Crossota,\" the NOAA said in a statement. It noted that the jellyfish has two sets of tentacles -- one much longer than the other. Advertisement In the first part of the video, it's suggested that the jellyfish was in \"ambush predation mode\" because its long tentacles are even and extended outward, while the bell doesn't move. Researchers speculate the red canals connect to the bright yellow objects, which could be gonads , reproductive glands that produce sperm in males and eggs in females. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Canadian Company Patents Inflatable 'Space Elevator' It would be more than 12 miles high, complete with a runway and launchpad on top. By Ryan Grenoble Senior Reporter Aug 17, 2015, 01:29 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Not even Willy Wonka could dream up an elevator this otherworldly. The Canadian company Thoth Technology has secured a U.S. patent for a 12.4-mile-tall inflatable space elevator that, if it is ever built, could drastically reduce the cost of transporting both cargo and people into space. A visualization of Thoth Technology's new inflatable space elevator concept. Credit: Thoth Technology Advertisement The freestanding tower would be comprised of inflated sections \"held rigid by pressurized gas,\" notes Global Construction Review , and would stand 20 times higher than Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's current tallest building. \" Astronauts would ascend to 20 km by electrical elevator ,\" inventor Brendan Quine explained in a media release. \"From the top of the tower, space planes will launch in a single stage to orbit, returning to the top of the tower for refueling and reflight.\" The company believes the elevator could save more than 30 percent of the fuel used to power a conventional rocket, thereby making \"space flight more like taking a passenger jet,\" according to Thoth CEO Caroline Roberts. Advertisement A visualization of the top of the space elevator. Credit: Toch Technology The concept of a space elevator is nothing new, going back to Russian space pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky 's 1895 idea of constructing a free-standing tower tall enough to reach geostationary orbit , the point in space where a satellite orbits at the same speed as Earth's rotation, thus staying in one spot above the Earth's surface. That would mean building a tower about 22,000 miles high -- something that's currently impossible, because there is no readily available material that could support a tower that tall, notes The Telegraph . From that elevation, the cost of transporting goods into space would drop drastically , from around $10,000 per pound using today's rocket technology to around $230 per pound, reports the BBC. Advertisement Another visualization of the top of the tower. Courtesy, Toth Technology While the 12.4-mile Thoth elevator would fall far short of a geostationary orbit, it could still cut down on the cost of space travel incurred by fighting gravity, explains CNet's Eric Mack : 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

What the Thoth elevator (theoretically) does is get your payload past the worst of the launch. Most of the mass of a rocket is fuel, and yet more fuel is required to lift it. Air resistance is also significant when you\u2019re trying to get tons of junk to move at 25,000 mph -- just think about how difficult things get when you ride a bike against a wind. Even a 12-mile-high elevator would eliminate much of that, with a launch platform at the top for further travel. Fantastic as it sounds, the Thoth tower remains little more than a patented concept for now, but one that's certain to be the subject of some discussion at the 2015 Space Elevator Conference in Seattle, Washington, this weekend.

Your Face Wash Is Killing Oysters Microplastics could be harming future generations of these helpful bivalves. By Jenna Amatulli Reporter, HuffPost Feb 2, 2016, 05:07 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Like these little guys? Don't use products that contain microbeads, which can be harmful to ocean life, according to scientists. Peter Johansky/Getty Images Oysters are powerful little shellfish that do a lot for us, and we're making their lives difficult. Small plastic particles known as microplastics, which are commonly found in cosmetics, are causing oysters to develop serious reproductive problems, scientists at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found in a disheartening new study. It's not particularly new that microplastics are bad, but what's alarming is that they could affect future generations of ocean life. Advertisement The damage to oysters that ingest the plastic happens fast. Researchers tested Pacific oysters in tanks and found that oysters exposed to microplastics produced smaller eggs and less mobile sperm compared to a control group of oysters in a tank that did not contain microplastics. After two months of eating the plastic, the oysters had 41 percent fewer offspring, which grew slower than normal. It's not clear exactly what the plastic is doing to the oysters, but it might be interfering with their hormones or blocking their digestive systems, making it harder for them to eat food and get energy. Advertisement Tiny plastic beads used in products such as facial cleansers and toothpaste have started showing up in lakes and oceans around the world. MN Pollution Control Agency/Flickr Microplastics end up in the ocean for a lot of reasons, but they are notably a problem in beauty products like face wash and toothpaste -- which usually go straight down the drain instead of being properly discarded, according to BeatTheMicrobead.org , an anti-microplastics campaign. Scientists think that because the microplastic particles are about the same size as the phytoplankton oysters typically consume, they eat them without understanding that they're different. Advertisement The particles also pose a threat to other marine bivalves that feed the way oysters do. Oysters clean water, remove nitrogen, accelerate denitrification, and provide excellent habitats for lots of fish and crustaceans -- they are some of the better bottom dwellers in our waters. So, while the U.S. government is making slow strides to help decrease our plastic consumption -- including recently passed legislation banning microbeads -- we're still a long way away from making the ocean a happy home. Advertisement Want to help? Recycle your plastics and donate to the National Resources Defense Council to help their efforts to rid our oceans of waste.

There's No Back Pain Surgery Can't Make Worse Lots of elective surgery is probably unnecessary, and back operations are the most notorious example. By Allen Frances, M.D., Contributor Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Allen Frances MD is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and former Chair at Duke University Jan 5, 2015, 11:30 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Surgery is much less science-based than the rest of medicine. It is almost impossible to subject it to studies that are double-blind and placebo-controlled. Surgical guidelines are therefore necessarily much more anecdotal than based on evidence. Lots of elective surgery is probably unnecessary, and back operations are the most notorious example. Back pain is an inevitable and fairly ubiquitous complication of the human condition, arising from our incomplete postural adaptation to bipedal locomotion and the fact that we now live much longer than our backs are adapted for. Back surgery is performed when the patient has a combination of pain and imaging pictures that show spinal abnormalities. The natural assumption is that what shows up in the pictures must be causing the pain. But that assumption is wrong. Lots of people have very messed-up pictures but no pain , and lots of other people have very pretty pictures but lots of pain. And as you get older, your spine shows progressively more imaging findings best considered indicative of normal aging, not disease. Advertisement And things have gotten even worse since Big Pharma began pushing prescription narcotics as a panacea for all pain. While helpful and safe for some, prescription opioids have become a major public-health nightmare. The drugs are prescribed carelessly even though they are frequently addicting. Remarkably, prescription drugs now kill more people than car accidents or street drugs. So back pain invites two dangers: unnecessarily invasive surgery and unnecessary, life-threatening addiction. Operating on the basis of pictures, not the person, often leads to no benefit or even harm. Giving out powerful meds like candy can lead to addiction and death. For years I have been advising friends, relatives, and patients to avoid the knife and the pill and depend instead on rehab, exercise, and distraction. Some listen. Many don't. Usually the reply is that I don't understand how badly they feel. To reinforce the message, I have asked a present sufferer of back pain to share her experience. Lynn writes: Advertisement When I got sciatica, I went through one doctor after another and through one treatment after another -- chiropractic, acupuncture, 2 rounds of not aggressive physical therapy, numerous MRI's, trigger point shots of cortisone and lidocaine, and so forth. Surgery was recommended by several different surgeons. The opinions were all over the place and I was getting increasingly confused and discouraged. The pain got worse and often I couldn't think of anything else. My GP prescribed an opioid for me. I was concerned the pills could become addictive but she (like two other doctors) blythely and incorrectly told me this would not be a problem. I think doctors prescribe opioids so carelessly just because they want to get you out of the office and have been brainwashed by drug salesmen to minimize the risks. I reluctantly tried the pills but luckily just didn't like them. They made me constipated and kept me awake at night, actually causing nightmares. Then I found a doctor who set me straight and changed everything. He bluntly told me that I was in a chronic cycle of pain and that the fear or anticipation of pain only exacerbates the pain. No pain pills in the world can prevent fear of pain. He told me that I needed to take a much more aggressive rehab and exercise approach to the sciatica problem. Frankly, I was disappointed to discover that I was part of the problem. I wanted a quick medical or surgical solution to my problem, an easy fix. But there isn't one. Part of the remedy was to realize that I was part of the problem. Yes, in anticipating pain, I was causing more pain. When we anticipate pain, we actually tense up more, which leads to more anxiety, which leads to more tightened muscles and then more pain. So how did I overcome my fear of and preoccupation with my pain? It isn't easy, but it works. I practice mindfulness in additional to the very intensive physical therapy. The PT is a gradual process, but I am now lifting dead weights using my back with the goal of lifting 50 pounds. I am up to 40 pounds and feel confident I will make it the rest of the way. Of course there are a series of other weight exercises I do, all tough, and all exceeding my previously perceived capacity. And I do lots of stretching. Mindfulness has also been a big help. The idea is to notice pain, but then come back to what you are doing at the moment. Right now I have some pain but I am concentrating instead on typing this note. Rather than focusing on my pain, I note it just like you might notice a bird flying by, but then go right back to what I am focusing on doing. It takes mental work, but it does work. Focusing on breathing techniques is also part of the mindfulness technique. The book that helped me the most is called, \"Back Sense, a Revolutionary Approach to Halting the Cycle of Chronic Back Pain,\" Siegel, Urdang, and Johnson. When I was reading it two things occurred: 1) I thought I was reading a book just about me and my situation and 2) I realized that I can fix this. Believe it or not, the pain began to diminish almost immediately. Once I realized that I'm in charge, I felt better. Really, absolutely true. Opioid drugs often only disguise the pain and are NOT the best remedy for fixing or alleviating it. They are only making the drug makers rich. Plain and simple. I would recommend not starting them at all and if you are on them slowly get off. It may be hard because of withdrawal and must be done under a doctors supervision, but do it. Skip a dose and take a walk. Thanks so much, Lynn. Certainly there are situations where back surgery is clearly necessary (and sometimes urgently so), and other situations where it is a last resort, after all else has been tried. But the knife should be used sparingly and judiciously, only after all other possibilities have been considered and have failed. Advertisement Decisions about surgery are too important to be left exclusively in the hands of surgeons. They have inherent financial, intellectual, emotional, professional, ego-driven and guild conflicts of interest that make them predisposed toward quick decisions and excessively aggressive treatment. Rehab doctors are more likely to be patient and disinterested. Doctors who carelessly prescribe opioids are little better and just as dangerous as drug pushers.

Pesticides Put Wild Bees At Risk, Food Safety Watchdog Confirms The EU has had a moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids since 2014 after lab research pointed to potential risks for bees. By Kate Kelland Mar 1, 2018, 04:19 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING LONDON (Reuters) - Wild bees and honeybees are put at risk by three pesticides from a group known as neonicotinoids, Europe\u2019s food safety watchdog said on Wednesday, confirming previous concerns that prompted an EU-wide ban on use of the chemicals. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report, which covered wild bees and honeybees and included a systematic review of scientific evidence published since EFSA\u2019s 2013 evaluation, is seen as crucial to whether the European moratorium on neonicotinoid use remains in place. Advertisement The EU has had a moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids since 2014 after lab research pointed to potential risks for bees. Heinz-Peter Bader / Reuters The updated risk assessment found variations due to factors such as species of bee, exposure and specific pesticide, \u201cbut overall the risk to the three types of bees we have assessed is confirmed,\u201d said Jose Tarazona, head of EFSA\u2019s pesticides unit. The European Union has since 2014 had a moratorium on use of neonicotinoids - made and sold by various companies including Bayer and Syngenta - after lab research pointed to potential risks for bees, which are crucial for pollinating crops. Advertisement EU nations will discuss a European Commission proposal to ban three neonicotinoids next month in the Plant Animal Food and Feed Standing Committee. \u201cThis is strengthening the scientific basis for the Commission\u2019s proposal to ban outdoor use of the three neonicotinoids,\u201d a spokeswoman for the EU executive said. Crop chemical companies have argued that real-world evidence is not there to blame a global plunge in bee numbers in recent years on neonicotinoid pesticides alone. They say it is a complex phenomenon caused by a number of factors. Advertisement The industry lobby said that while it allows that there may be a risk to bees, EFSA has overstated it. It argued that any risk can be managed and a ban would cause further harm by forcing farmers to extend agricultural lands. \u201cFarmers need access to a broad range of tools to protect their crops,\u201d Graeme Taylor of the European Crop Protection Association said. Two major field studies in Europe and Canada published last year that sought to examine real-world effects gave mixed results. They found some negative effects after exposure to neonicotinoids in wild and honeybee populations, and also some positives, depending on the environmental context. Advertisement Environmental campaigners said the study confirmed regulators should act to ban the use of neonicotinoids. \u201cNational governments must stop dithering ... to prevent the catastrophic collapse of bee populations,\u201d said Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace EU food policy adviser. Wednesday\u2019s EFSA report looked in detail at three specific neonicotinoids - clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam \u2013and assessed bee exposure to them via three routes: residues in bee pollen and nectar, dust drift during sowing or application of treated seeds, and water consumption. Advertisement Some scenarios, such as when the pesticides are used on crops inside glass greenhouses, present a low risk to bees, Tarazona told Reuters. But others, such as using neonicotinoids on flowering field crops that attract bees, are high risk. He said EFSA\u2019s findings would now be shared with European Commission risk managers and then with EU member States, who will decide on any potential changes to current restrictions. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

King Tut Mystery Deepens As Metals, Organic Material Detected Behind Tomb Walls \"It could be the discovery of the century.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Mar 18, 2016, 03:26 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING It's being hailed as the potential \"discovery of the century\" -- and it hasn't even been discovered yet. Newly released data from radar scans of King Tutankhamun\u2019s tomb find that not only are there secret chambers likely hidden behind the walls, but objects in them as well. The radar scans reveal \"metal\" and \"organic materials ,\" according to Egyptian officials speaking at a news conference in Cairo on Thursday. Advertisement It's far too early to say if \"metals\" means a long-lost treasure and if \"organic materials\" indicates a mummy or mummies, but Egyptian officials, hoping for a much-needed tourism boost , are excited by the possibility. \" It could be the discovery of the century ,\u201d Mamdouh Eldamaty, the Egyptian antiquities minister, said in a news story from National Geographic, which also released images from the tomb: Antiquities Minister Mamdouh Eldamaty, Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves and others examine the walls of King Tut's tomb, looking for signs of a hidden passage in an image provided by National Geographic. Brando Quilici/National Geographic Channels Advertisement The new revelations offer more support for the theory that launched the experiments in the first place. Last summer, Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves of the University of Arizona made international headlines when he said he found evidence that the walls of the tomb had been patched over in two places , as if entrances to other chambers had been covered up. He made the discovery not in the 3,300-year-old tomb itself, which is located in the Valley of the Kings, but by examining high-resolution scans of the wall made by Factum Arte . Advertisement Later, an on-site inspection of the tomb with Egyptian officials also revealed signs of the ancient cover-up , and in November a radar specialist scanned the walls and found what he called \"an entrance to something\" hidden within. \" It\u2019s very obvious that this is something ,\" Hirokatsu Watanabe told NatGeo at the time. \"It\u2019s very deep.\" Radar specialist Hirokatsu Watanabe examines the walls of King Tut's tomb in an image provided by National Geographic. Brando Quilici/National Geographic Channels Advertisement Reeves believes the hidden chamber is the long-lost final resting place of Queen Nefertiti -- and that if she's in there, the chamber and its treasures have likely been untouched by grave robbers. Not everyone is sold on this idea, however. \"There is not a 1 percent chance Reeves' theory is correct,\" Zahi Hawass, the country's former antiquities minister, told the Telegraph in December. \u201c Mr Reeves sold the air to us ,\" he was quoted as saying. \"I confirm that there is nothing at all behind the wall.\" Advertisement In addition, Live Science reports that the Valley of the Kings is notorious for tripping up radar readings with false positives that look like walls and tombs. \"There are fissures, seams of chert and gypsum, and voids in the bedrock known as karsts,\" radar specialist Glen Dash said, according to the website. \" They are so common that there was really no place in the Valley that we did not encounter them .\" But experts who've reviewed the scans say the data is solid. Remy Hiramoto, a specialist in semiconductors and microelectronics, told National Geographic that there's \"a non-natural occurring chamber or cavity on the other side of that wall.\" Advertisement \"Based on the signatures that are in the data, there\u2019s a void, and there\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s within the void,\" he said. \"There\u2019s something in there.\" A National Geographic team will perform a second set of scans in the tomb later this month. Eldamaty, the antiquities minister, will then have to decide what to do next. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The problem with reaching whatever is on the other side of the wall is that the wall itself is a priceless work of art. Advertisement Last year, Eldamaty told National Geographic that they may be able to drill a small hole in a nearby wall and send a camera through -- but if it reveals artifacts, getting access to them won't be easy and may even involve removing the entire painted wall in Tut's tomb .

This Machine Will Create The Largest Manmade Waves In The World Sorry dude, no surfing. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Oct 3, 2015, 08:52 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Here comes the wave! Scientists at Deltares, a research institute in the Netherlands, say that they have created a machine that can produce the largest human-made waves in the world , Science magazine reports. The enormous model is called the Delta Flume . The water-filled trough is approximately 984 feet long and 16 feet across, and its walls are 31 feet high. Advertisement The magazine explains how it works: At one end sits a gigantic metal plate called a wave board; four pistons move it back and forth to whip up the kind of waves that the sea can unleash. The waves travel along the flume and crash onto whatever researchers have built at the other end\u2014which could include a novel type of dike, an artificial sand dune or gravel beach, or a pylon used to hold up an offshore wind turbine. So far, the machine has topped out at an 18-foot wave, but researchers hope to go higher. Scientists in the Netherlands have created a machine that can create huge waves. Courtesy of Deltares The machine cost approximately $30 million to construct , and can contain up to 2,400,000 gallons of water, the BBC reports. Advertisement Researchers say they will test \"wave heights, wave pressures and forces, flow velocities, wave overtopping, damage patterns and changes in cross-sections.\" They will be able to analyze large water movements as well as smaller ones, between rocks, for example. Findings could lead to new strategies for shoreline protection.

Tomb Of Egyptian Queen Khentakawess III Discovered In Abusir Tomb Of Lost Egyptian Queen Discovered By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jan 5, 2015, 03:47 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A long-forgotten queen of Egypt has been rediscovered by Czech archaeologists, who unearthed her 4,500-year-old tomb at the Abusir necropolis just outside of Cairo. Inscriptions on the tomb indicate her name was Khentakawess, or Khentkaus, and that she was married to the Pharaoh Neferefre, also known as King Raneferef, who ruled briefly during the 5th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, the team announced on Sunday. Advertisement Since there have been two other queens with the same name, the archaeologists are calling her Khentakawess III, or Khentkaus III, according to AFP. It's the \" first time we have discovered the name of this queen who had been unknown before the discovery of her tomb ,\" antiquities minister Mamdouh al-Damaty said in a statement cited by AFP. \"This discovery will help us shed light on certain unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, witnessed the construction of the first pyramids.\" Inscriptions also identify her as \"wife of the king\" and \"mother of the king.\" Miroslav Barta, head of the team that made the discovery, told the EFE news agency that Khentakawess III would have been the mother of Pharoah Menkahur in addition to being wife of Neferefre . Advertisement While the tomb had long ago been raided by grave robbers, the archaeologists found a number of statuettes as well as utensils made of limestone and copper , the Czech Institute of Egyptology said in a news release: \"The tomb is very similar to the rest of the burial in the cemetery which was unearthed by the Czech mission in the '90s,\" Kamal Wahid, Giza Antiquities director, told the Luxor Times. \" The upper part is a mastaba and a small offerings chapel and the burial chamber in the lower part which is reached through a shaft .\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Hubble Space Telescope -- Personal Reflections on the 25th Anniversary Centuries from now, when historians look back at the discoveries that have shaped our view of the universe, I believe that the Hubble Space Telescope will have earned its place. By Jeffrey Bennett, Contributor Astrophysicist, educator, author Astrophysicist, educator, author Apr 27, 2015, 06:55 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

April 25, 2015 marks 25 years since the Hubble Space Telescope was released from the Space Shuttle cargo bay to become a free-flying mini-moon of Earth. Since that time, this amazing spacecraft has logged some 5 billion kilometers (3 billion miles) in its orbit around Earth. But if that distance sounds far, it is nothing compared to how much farther Hubble has seen . If Hubble had traveled the 5-billion-kilometer distance straight outward into space, it would now take its light a little more than 4 \u00bd hours to travel back to Earth. But the light that Hubble has recorded from some distant galaxies has traveled through space for more than 12 billion years to reach us. Hubble has dramatically enhanced our view of the universe, both in space and in time. Hubble's story is being retold in many media retrospectives, so I'll give only the briefest overview here. From the time Galileo first turned his telescope to the sky in 1609 until the launch of Hubble, nearly all astronomical observations had been conducted with telescopes on the ground. (Yes, there were a number of space observatories prior to Hubble, but none that could take visible light pictures with anywhere near the same power.) While these telescopes had taught us much about the universe, astronomers had long recognized that ground-based telescopes suffered from two major limitations: Because ground-based telescopes peer through Earth's turbulent atmosphere, their images tend to be blurred; in essence, it is the same effect that makes stars twinkle in the night sky, even though the stars themselves are steady sources of light. Much of the light that comes to us from the cosmos is in forms that our eyes cannot see, such as infrared and ultraviolet light, most of this light cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere, rendering it impossible for ground-based telescopes to observe. Hubble's placement above Earth's atmosphere overcomes both limitations, allowing it to obtain crystal clear images of the universe in visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light. The idea for Hubble is usually traced back to astronomer Lyman Spitzer, who pushed for a space telescope beginning in 1946. (Others had suggested space telescopes earlier, but not with the same level of detail.) Congress approved the project in 1977, in part to provide a mission for the new Space Shuttle, which could deliver it to space and allow astronauts to service it. Its launch date was set back more than 3 years by the 1986 loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger. It finally lifted off in the Space Shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990, which released it into space the next day. Advertisement The telescope takes its name from Edwin Hubble, a giant of astronomy who, in 1923, discovered the first definitive proof that the Milky Way is just one of billions of galaxies in the universe. This fact is worth brief elaboration, since it surprises many people today, when spectacular telescopic photos like those form the Hubble Space Telescope make it seem obvious that there are countless galaxies beyond our own. At the time, however, telescopes showed other galaxies only as rather fuzzy blobs of light, and until Edwin Hubble's work, no one had been able to determine for certain whether those blobs were distant collections of stars or relatively nearby clouds of gas. The latter possibility implied that the Milky Way might represent the entire universe, so in proving this possibility to be incorrect, Hubble effectively made us realize that the universe was some 100 billion times larger than we had known before. He culminated this work with his 1929 discovery that our entire universe is expanding. In this sense, naming the Hubble Space Telescope for Mr. Hubble not only honored his achievements but also hinted at the way it would expand the understanding of the universe that Hubble had first offered us. Of course, there's another aspect to the Hubble Space Telescope story, and that is one of resilience and perseverance. Shortly after its launch, astronomers were dismayed to find that it was not taking the clear images that had been expected. With a thorough investigation that would make Sherlock Holmes proud, scientists and engineers traced the problem to a flaw in the shape of the telescope's primary mirror - the part of the telescope that collects all the light from distant objects. Fortunately, the telescope's shape proved to be \"perfectly flawed,\" in the sense that it had been made perfectly but to the wrong shape. As a result, scientists and engineers were able to design mirrors and lenses that could be attached to telescope instruments and reverse the effects of the flaw; in essence, providing \"eyeglasses\" for the world's most powerful telescope. These corrective lenses were first installed in 1993, and from that time on the telescope has been able to fulfill its full potential. Advertisement This is where my personal reflections come in. I had the great privilege of being hired to work at NASA Headquarters shortly after the mirror flaw was discovered. Although I had absolutely nothing to do with any of the work that made the fix possible -- my job was to create ways of leveraging astronomy missions for education and outreach -- I in essence had a front-row seat to everything that transpired. The dedication and integrity shown by scientists, engineers, and, yes, \"bureaucrats\" who were typically in the office before 7am and working late into the evening every day, was something to behold. There are far too many unsung heroes to mention here, but I'll call attention to one: Charlie Pellerin, the Director of Astrophysics at the time. As the leader of the Division that had launched the flawed mirror, Dr. Pellerin was on the hot seat, called often to testify before Congress and speak to the news media. Yet Charlie managed always to maintain focus on discovering the source of the problem (which proved to have been due to the contractor, not to NASA's oversight) and finding the fix, and I believe his leadership was a key part of the reason that the Hubble Space Telescope ultimately succeeded. How successful has it been? Shortly before Hubble was launched, and before I was officially hired on at NASA, I was asked to review a short video that sought to explain the mission. It was very well done, but I had one complaint: While I was as confident at the time as anyone that Hubble would prove to be a great observatory, I thought the video had gone over the top in claiming that it would be as revolutionary in our time as Galileo's telescope had been in his. My caution seemed especially well-warranted when the mirror flaw was discovered. But then it was fixed... and I can now admit that I was wrong. Centuries from now, when historians look back at the discoveries that have shaped our view of the universe, I believe that the Hubble Space Telescope will have earned its place.

Odd 'Scarface' Creature Roamed Earth 255 Million Years Ago The prehistoric carnivore may have had venom-delivering chompers. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 17, 2015, 10:51 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An illustration of the only other therocephalian thought to be venomous, Euchambersia (on left), with its prey, a dicynodont (on right). Wikimedia Commons Say hello to \"Scarface.\" The newly discovered species of pre-mammal roamed the Earth about 255 million years ago -- and was way more intimidating than Al Pacino. The species, whose name, Ichibengops munyamadziensis, roughly translates to \"Scarface of the Munyamadzi River,\" was recently identified on the basis of two partial skulls that were unearthed in Zambia in 2009. Advertisement Why Scarface? \"The groove on the face of Ichibengops is one of its most distinctive features, so it makes sense to have the name refer to that,\" Dr. Kenneth Angielczyk, associate curator of paleomammalogy at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of a paper describing the new species, told The Huffington Post in an email. (Story continues below image.) Photograph and line drawing the skull of Ichibengops munyamadziensis. Adam Huttenlocker Ichibengops was about the size of a dachshund and had furrows above its teeth that might have been used to deliver venom. Yikes. Advertisement Ichibengops belonged to an extinct group of reptiles called therocephalians , or \"beast-heads.\" Since these animals were closely related to the ancestors of modern-day mammals , the possibility that Ichibengops might have been venomous spotlights the rare capability of mammals and their extinct relatives to produce venom. The duck-billed platypus and certain shrew species are the only living mammals known to have the capability. \"There is only one other therocephalian that seems to show indications of being venomous ,\" which would be the extinct therocephalian Euchambersia , Dr. Christian Sidor, professor of biology at the University of Washington in Seattle and co-author of the paper, said in a written statement. \"However, it\u2019s very difficult to assess function in fossils, so we can never be 100 percent certain.\" Advertisement The paper was published online in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology on July 20, 2015. Scarface wasn't the only monstrous species in prehistory. Check out the \"Talk Nerdy To Me\" episode below for five prehistoric beasts that may surprise you.

The Kind Of Person Who Has More Sex Will Surprise You Looks aren't everything! By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jul 22, 2016, 02:27 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Helping others may have surprising rewards. Jacques-Louis David (1748\u00e21825) | Public Domain People who tend to put others\u2019 well-being over their own and are quick to lend a helping hand may be rewarded by having more sex, and more sexual partners, than the average person, suggests a study released this week. A team of researchers in Canada asked nearly 300 unmarried, heterosexual men and women a series of questions, including whether they did volunteer work or donated blood. Participants who scored high on the altruism questionnaire also reported attracting more interest from the opposite sex. They also tended to have more sex, both inside and outside of relationships, than others. Advertisement In case participants didn\u2019t accurately report their own tendencies to be altruistic, the researchers also asked them to play a game that tested whether they were willing to donate potential monetary winnings. Again, the scientists found that the more selfless people were also more likely to report having better sex lives. \u201cAltruism may tangibly benefit mating in humans living in Western industrialized society,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study in the British Journal of Psychology . These findings help solve one piece of the puzzle of understanding altruism \u2015 a trait that has been observed in a wide range of species, including fish, birds , monkeys, elephants and humans living in both modern societies and in hunter-gatherer tribes . Advertisement Helping others often comes at a personal cost. Even donating blood, something that most people have enough of to share, means getting pricked by a syringe. Yet we make such sacrifices, not just because we\u2019re told we should, but because we feel good when we do. According the theory of reciprocity \u2015 one of the main hypotheses to explain the paradox of altruism \u2015 individuals behave selflessly to receive help, or something else positive, in the future. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

But it seems that, as the new findings suggest, selflessness also signals being a more desirable mate. This means our generous ancestors may have had more reproductive success, and that we have inherited their genes for generosity. Advertisement \u201cIf the more altruistic of our forebears were not only perceived as more attractive, but also had more sex, this would help explain why many modern humans have inherited the inclination to be altruistic,\u201d neuroscientist Christian Jarrett wrote in BPS Research Digest . So, if you\u2019ve donated blood recently, you might want to mention it on your Tinder profile.

This Bizarre Trick Will Get A Catchy Song Out Of Your Head This Science-Backed Trick Will Get That Annoying Song Out Of Your Head By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Apr 25, 2015, 07:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Do you have an obnoxiously catchy song lyric stuck on repeat in your brain? New research suggests that the secret to getting rid of these \"earworms\" may be as simple as chewing a stick of gum. According to a new study conducted by psychologists at the University of Reading in the U.K., chewing diverts attention away from the catchy melody or lyric. Earworms happen to as many as 90 percent of people at least once a week, psychologist Vicky Williamson told NPR's John Donvan in 2012. The University of Reading researchers said in a press release about their work that one study found 15 percent of people classify their earworms as \"disturbing.\" Advertisement The researchers, who published their work this month in the quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology , said that learning how to reduce the occurrence of earworms may have implications for other types of intrusive thoughts, such as those that characterize psychological disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). For the experiment, researchers asked 98 study participants to listen to catchy songs like \"Payphone\" by Maroon 5 and \"Play Hard\" by David Guetta. For three minutes after listening to the song, the participants were asked to hit a button whenever the song popped back into their head. During the three-minute period, the participants chewed gum, tapped their finger on the table or did neither. The researchers found that people who chewed gum after listening to the songs \"heard\" the song playing in their mind a third less often than those who were not chewing gum. Advertisement How does it work? Reading psychologist Dr. Phil Beaman explained that chewing gum co-opts some of the brain's regions involved in earworms. \"Brain regions involved in hearing, remembering and imagining tunes include not only the auditory cortex but also regions more usually associated with speech production,\" Beaman told The Huffington Post in an email. \"By forcing these regions to be active in chewing the gum, they were less available to support the involuntary generation or recollection of an earworm.\" Beyond earworms, Beaman hopes that the research may pave the way for methods of managing more debilitating invasive thoughts in people with psychiatric conditions. Advertisement \"Interfering with our own 'inner speech' through a more sophisticated version of the gum-chewing approach may work more widely,\" he said in a statement . \"However, more research is needed to see whether this will help counter symptoms of obsessive-compulsive and similar disorders.\" In the meantime, make sure you have a pack of Juicy Fruit at the ready for when this song comes on the radio: 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Who Clearly Love 'Star Wars' Name Beetle After Chewbacca Trigonopterus chewbacca has some Wookiee characteristics, researchers say. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Apr 28, 2016, 12:16 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This beetle would make an excellent sidekick for space travel, assuming it behaves anything like its namesake. Van Dam, Laufa, Riedel Han Solo\u2019s companion isn't as tall as we remember. A newly discovered weevil beetle has been named after the 7-foot-6-inch Wookiee Chewbacca , according to a paper published Tuesday in the journal ZooKeys . The Trigonopterus chewbacca was one of four new weevils identified in Papua New Guinea during a 10-day research expedition, according to the paper. For better or worse, the other weevils are not named after famous movie sidekicks. Advertisement Researchers said that they named the weevil after the Wookiee because of its dense scales on the head and legs, which \"reminds the authors of Chewbacca\u2019s dense fur.\" via GIPHY 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Astronomers Discover Tiny, Shy Moon Hiding In The Shadows Of The Solar System Hey there, lil fella! By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 26, 2016, 11:50 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA, ESA and Alex Parker It turns out Makemake -- an atmosphere-less dwarf planet in the outermost reaches of our solar system -- has been hiding a companion. There, circling some 13,000 miles from the icy planetoid , scientists spotted a small moon, nicknamed MK2. Advertisement The moon's discovery, announced Tuesday by Hubble Space Telescope scientists, comes more than a decade after astronomers first spotted Makemake in 2005. Alex Parker , a planetary astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told National Geographic that when he glimpsed the object during an analysis of Hubble observations back in April 2015, he assumed it wasn't the first time someone had spied the moonlet. Instead, Parker quickly learned he'd discovered a moon 1,300 times fainter than its host dwarf planet. Advertisement This Hubble Space Telescope image reveals the first moon ever discovered around the dwarf planet Makemake. The tiny moon, located just above Makemake in this image, is barely visible because it is almost lost in the glare of the very bright dwarf planet. NASA, ESA, Alex Parker As Hubble notes in its announcement, several previous visual sweeps of MK2 showed a lonely mass, one of several dwarf planets located in the Kuiper Belt -- a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. The team of scientists ultimately observed MK2 thanks to Hubble's \"unique ability to see faint objects near bright ones,\" it said. \" It is a very exciting discovery !\" Parker, who led the image analysis for the observations, told The Associated Press. \"It means that Makemake is no longer the odd-one-out in the moon-hosting Kuiper Belt dwarf planet club.\" Advertisement Makemake, named after the god of fertility in the Rapa Nui mythology of Easter Island, is 870 miles wide and takes roughly 310 Earth-years to circle the sun. In comparison, the newly discovered moon has a diameter of about 100 miles. Parker said in a statement that the discovery will provide researchers \" an opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail,\" perhaps answering questions about the mass, origin and evolution of the dwarf-planet system. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Why Nature Can Flourish In War Zones These three cases show that the environment can sometimes benefit from conflict. By Casey Williams On assignment for HuffPost Mar 18, 2016, 11:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT JUNG YEON-JE via Getty Images War often devastates natural environments -- bombs and bullets can destroy forests , kill animals and contaminate rivers . But human conflict has also protected natural areas, according to conservation biologist Dr. Thor Hanson . \"It's an unexpected finding in some ways,\" the author of The Triumph of Seeds , told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. \"But it makes logical sense.\" This is because biodiversity can rebound in areas where fighting has reduced human activity, he explained. Advertisement The most striking example of a war's conserving power might be the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. The area commonly known as the DMZ was set up in 1953 after the Korean War to mark the boundary between the two East Asian countries. Although it represents a bloody gash in the region's history, the zone is now remarkably biodiverse , Hanson said. \"Y ou have several kilometer-wide strip going from coast to coast that is depopulated,\" he said. \"There's a de facto park between those counties; all sorts of species are thriving there that have disappeared outside that area.\" Advertisement The Korean demilitarized zone, seen from the Cheorwon Peace Observatory in Cheorwon, South Korea. Bloomberg via Getty Images Similar conflict-cum-conservation zones exist around the world. The island of Vieques , Puerto Rico, was a bombing range for the U.S. Navy until 2003. Much of the island was turned into a national wildlife refuge after the navy left. Although bombs decimated marine life around the island, Vieques is now one of the most ecologically diverse areas in the Caribbean, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Michele Falzone via Getty Images Advertisement Several thousand miles south, in the Falkland Islands , penguins thrive among the land mines that litter the countryside. Soldiers laid down nearly 20,000 mines there during the 1982 Falklands War . The minefields have kept people out, but members of the island's growing penguin population are too light to spring them. \"So you have penguin rookeries on top of the minefields,\" Hanson said. While fishing threatened the Falklands' penguin population in the 1980s, the de facto wildlife refuge the minefields provided has allowed the flightless birds to thrive . A colony of King Penguins on the Falkland Islands. Wolfgang Kaehler via Getty Images Advertisement The pressures of war can conserve land in other surprising ways. For instance, the Department of Defense has set aside 260,000 acres of land near military bases across the country so soldiers can train on undeveloped land. Conservation biologists have also proposed turning the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay into a protected area for scientific research. Joe Roman, a fellow at the University of Vermont's Gund Institute for Ecological Economics, said r esearchers hope that the base will close. Much of the site's 45 square miles of land remains undeveloped, Roman said. Advertisement \"That's not to say that it\u2019s pristine,\" he told HuffPost. \"But it's not developed in the way that, let\u2019s say, a city is.\" Most scientists agree that, overall, war tends to be devastating for the environment -- and it's not only bombs and gunfire that destroy natural spaces. Excessive energy use, resource consumption and waste production during wartime combine to make human conflict uniquely destructive to the planet. But while war more often destroys environments than preserves them, paying attention to cases in which conflict leads to conservation can teach scientists how to protect environments during and after war, according to Hanson. Advertisement \"Of course war is bad,\" Hanson said. \"But if you\u2019re interested in conversing biodiversity then you must have a plan for working in conflict zones.\" For Roman, the tragedy of war can create opportunities for conservation. \"No one ever wants a war,\" Roman said. But in some cases, \" we can take advantage of them in order to advance the cause of peace and conservation.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Scientists Rush To Explore Underwater World Hidden Below Ice For 120,000 Years Scientists Rush To Explore Underwater World Hidden Below Ice For 120,000 Years Jeanna Bryner \u2014 Live Science Feb 21, 2018, 12:26 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Looking out from the sea ice to iceberg A68, around November 2017, just months after the berg calved from Antarctica\u2019s Larsen C Ice Shelf in July. Credit: NASA A huge, trillion-ton iceberg about the size of Delaware broke free from Antarctica\u2019s Larsen C Ice Shelf in July 2017. As it moved away from its chilly birth mom and into the Weddell Sea, a vast expanse of water saw the light for the first time in up to 120,000 years. And this month, a team of scientists will venture to the long-ice-buried expanse to investigate the mysterious ecosystem that was hidden beneath the Antarctic ice shelf for so long. Advertisement The newly exposed seabed stretches across an area of about 2,246 square miles (5,818 square kilometers), according to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), which is leading the expedition. The scientists consider their journey \u201curgent,\u201d as they hope to document the system before sunlight begins to change at least the surface layers. [ In Photos: Antarctica\u2019s Larsen C Ice Shelf Through Time ] \u201cThe calving of [iceberg] A-68 [from the Larsen C Ice Shelf] provides us with a unique opportunity to study marine life as it responds to a dramatic environmental change. It\u2019s important we get there quickly before the undersea environment changes as sunlight enters the water and new species begin to colonize,\u201d Katrin Linse, of the British Antarctic Survey, said in a statement. The edge of Larsen C Ice Shelf with the western edge of iceberg A68 in the distance. Credit: NASA Advertisement What lies beneath? Scientists know little about the possibly alien-like life that has taken up residence beneath Antarctica\u2019s ice shelf. What they do know comes from similar calving events in the past: Chunks of ice broke off the Larsen A and B shelves (located north of Larsen C on the Antarctic Peninsula) in 1995 and 2002, respectively. Two German expeditions to those \u201cnewly\u201d exposed areas revealed sparse life. However, it took five to 12 years for the expeditions to make it to those areas, and by that time creatures from other areas had made their way to both spots, Live Science previously reported . In other icy realms around Antarctica, some bizarre creatures have turned up. For instance, a bristled marine worm that lives in the Southern Ocean, and Live Science previously reported as looking like a \u201cChristmas ornament from hell,\u201d has an extendable throat tipped with pointy teeth. And some creatures have made a living under extreme conditions, including a crustacean called Lyssianasid amphipod, which was found thriving beneath the Ross Ice Shelf in western Antarctica. One of the more famous Antarctic animals, the icefish has natural antifreeze in its blood and body fluids, allowing it to survive the frigid temperatures of Earth\u2019s chilly bottom. To explore the once-hidden ecosystem, the scientists \u2014 hailing from nine research institutes \u2014 will set off from the Falkland Islands on Feb. 21. They plan to spend three weeks aboard the BAS research ship, the RRS James Clark Ross. To navigate the ice-filled water to the remote location, the ship will rely on satellite data, according to the BAS. Advertisement Once they arrive, the team plans to collect samples of life (seafloor animals, microbes, plankton and any other inhabitants) as well as sediments and water. Stay tuned.

Within the red circle is a huge bulge, or X-shaped mass of stars, at the center of the galaxy. NASA/JPL-Caltech What started out as a map of the galaxy that an astronomer shared on Twitter led to a collaboration that found strong evidence of a huge X-shaped structure formed by stars at the core of the Milky Way, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . Dustin Lang, an astronomer at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, tweeted an image from a website he created last year using data obtained by NASA\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer space telescope, or WISE , which surveyed the entire sky in 2010. Advertisement The following image shows, at left, the WISE space telescope during its 2009 assembly at the Space Dynamics Laboratory in Logan, Utah. At right, an illustration of the telescope as it surveyed the entire sky in infrared.

NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Dynamics Lab Lang\u2019s tweet showing an image of the WISE sky was spotted by Melissa Ness of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. Advertisement \u201cScientists on Twitter often share sneak peeks of interesting results or pretty pictures,\u201d Lang said, according to CNN . When Ness saw Lang\u2019s sky view on Twitter, she noticed something special about a group of stars at the center of the galaxy that form a bulge shape. \u201cIt was simply the most fantastic image of the Milky Way bulge that I had seen,\u201d Ness said. \u201cI studied the bulge for my Ph.D. and so was well aware that there are numerous works and data that demonstrate that there is an underlying X-shape in the bulge. But with that image that Dustin had made, we were clearly seeing this X-shape directly in a real image of the inner region of the galaxy for the first time.\u201d A few weeks after they shared emails about the significance of the X-spot, Lang and Ness met at a conference in the U.S. and embarked on a real study of the X grouping of stars. Advertisement Their collaborative results are in the July issue of The Astronomical Journal . In order to reveal the actual X shape at the galaxy\u2019s center, the scientists used original WISE imagery \u201cand subtracted a model of how stars would be distributed in a symmetrical bulge,\u201d according to NASA . The remaining X leftovers are seen in the following image: Scientists used original WISE imagery of the Milky Way galaxy (left) and subtracted a model of how stars would be distributed in a symmetrical bulge (center), resulting in the X leftovers revealed (right). NASA/JPL-Caltech/D.Lang \u201cThere was controversy about whether the X-shaped structure existed,\u201d Lang said in a University of Toronto statement . \u201cBut our paper gives a good view of the core of our own galaxy. I think it has provided pretty good evidence for the existence of the X-shaped structure.\u201d Advertisement This central bulge of stars further increases knowledge of the galaxy we call home. \u201cThe bulge is a key signature of formation of the Milky Way galaxy,\u201d Ness said in the University of Toronto release. \u201cIf we understand the bulge, we will understand the key processes that have formed and shaped our galaxy.\u201d As treasure hunting goes, X really does mark the spot \u2015 even an astronomical one, right here in our own galactic backyard.

If you are at all interested in astronomy, chances are you've already heard that the Hubble Space Telescope is celebrating its 25th anniversary this week. What some people may not know is that Hubble is one of four siblings, so to speak. Back in the 1980s, NASA commissioned the \"Great Observatories,\" each designed and built to study different wavelengths of light. The Electromagnetic Spectrum. NASA's Great Observatories (Compton, Chandra, Hubble and Spitzer) and the electromagnetic thermometer scale. (Credit: NASA/CXC/M.Weiss) The four Great Observatories , in order of their launches that took place between 1990 and 2003, are Hubble, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Advertisement A photo of the Hubble Space Telescope, doing its job in space. Credit: NASA NASA's Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24, 1990. Hubble has four main scientific instruments that allow it to observe not only in visible light but also near ultraviolet and near infrared. Hubble helped determine how old our Universe is, what quasars are, and also helped discover \"dark energy.\" The space shuttle crew took a photo of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory as the satellite was deployed, with Earth visible beneath it. Credit: NASA/MSFC In 1991, NASA launched a satellite into space carrying the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). The goal of Compton was to study gamma rays from objects far out into space. Gamma ray telescopes can study incredibly exotic objects such as blazars, magnetars, cosmic rays, and dark matter. Compton operated in space until when NASA intentionally sent it into the Earth's ocean in 2000. Advertisement An artist's illustration of the Chandra X-ray Observatory in space. Credit: NGST NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory is a telescope specially designed to detect X-ray emission from very hot regions of the Universe such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and matter around black holes. Because X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, Chandra must orbit above it, up to an altitude of 139,000 km (86,500 mi) in space. Chandra was launched aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1999 and continues to be in excellent health and deliver incredible science over a decade and half later. An artist's illustration of the Spitzer Space Telescope in orbit. Credit: NASA The last of the Great Observatories, the Spitzer Space Telescope , was launched into orbit in 2003. Spitzer is designed to detect infrared light, which is primarily radiation from heat. This gives Spitzer the ability to study objects like brown dwarfs (failed stars), extrasolar planets, giant clouds of gas and dust, and organic molecules that may hold the key to life in the Universe. Over the years, astronomers have used often used data from these telescopes together. Not only does this reap incredible scientific rewards, the combined datasets from the different observatories often make spectacular images that help all viewers get a more complete picture of our fascinating Universe. (Astronomers call images with different types of light \"multiwavelength\" images because each type of light encompasses different sets of wavelengths.) We think this may be a perfect example of Aristotle's old adage that the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Advertisement With that, we've selected some of our favorite multiwavelength images with Hubble, Chandra and Spitzer data (and listed the colors that each image is shown in). Each type of light brings a new piece of the puzzle in the quest to understand the cosmos we live in. We hope there will be many more years to see our Universe in a whole new light.

Our Solar System May Have Had A Fifth 'Giant' Planet The missing planet bumped into Neptune before disappearing into the abyss of space, according to a new study. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Aug 16, 2015, 08:39 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The four gas giant planets in our solar system -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune -- may have a long-lost relative. According to a new study, our system was once home to a fifth gas giant that suddenly vanished some 4 billion years ago after a run-in with Neptune. Indirect evidence for this lost world is seen in a strange cluster of icy objects -- called the \"kernel\" -- in the Kuiper Belt . That's the vast region of primordial debris that encircles the sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. Advertisement \"The Kuiper Belt is a perfect clue to understanding how the solar system evolved since its formation,\" study author Dr. David Nesvorny, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., told New Scientist. (Story continues below.) An illustration of the Kuiper Belt. NASA For the study, Nesvorny created computer simulations of Neptune and the \"kernel\" cluster as they were 4 billion years ago in the early solar system. At the time, the cluster is believed to have been in Neptune's gravitational grasp. But then, according to the simulations, something happened to cause the cluster to escape Neptune's gravitational pull -- placing the cluster and Neptune in their present locations. Advertisement This is where the lost planet comes in: the simulations suggest that it must have been another gas giant that bumped Neptune and caused it and the \"kernel\" to part ways. \"The location and magnitude of Neptune's jump obtained in this model matches quite nicely the pattern that is needed for the formation of the 'kernel,'\" Nesvorny told The Huffington Post in an email. And according to the simulations, the planet couldn't have been one of the worlds currently in our solar system. The mysterious planet may have been ejected from the solar system after encountering Neptune. Advertisement In 2011, Nesvorny authored a previous study -- which involved thousands of computer simulations -- that suggested that the best way to explain the current orbits of the solar system's four giant planets was to include a missing fifth planet . \"I tend to believe that it may be very difficult to find any evidence for the fifth planet,\" Nesvorny said in the email. \"I started looking into [the] formation of the Kuiper Belt, because I was worried that the orbital structures seen there are inconsistent with my model. Now I realized that the opposite may be true. It was certainly a surprise.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Stunning New Charon Photos Reveal Pluto Moon's Violent Past Craters, sure, but Charon's surface also features mountains, landslides, and a gigantic canyon. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Oct 2, 2015, 08:34 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA has released striking new images of Pluto's largest moon, Charon , and the world they show is very different from what the space agency's scientists had expected. Many of the scientists had expected Charon to have a monotonous surface covered with craters, the agency said. Instead, the photos--taken by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on July 14--reveal a landscape dotted with mountains, canyons, and landslides. Advertisement The high-resolution photos also show stark variations in Charon's surface color. \u201cWe thought the probability of seeing such interesting features on this satellite of a world at the far edge of our solar system was low, but I couldn't be more delighted with what we see,\u201d Dr. Ross Beyer, an affiliate of the New Horizons team from the SETI Institute and NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, said in a written statement. (Story continues below images.) This image of Charon was captured by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on July 14, 2015. The colors have been processed to highlight Charon's varied surfaces. Charon is 754 miles across. This image resolves details as small as 1.8 miles. NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI This composite of enhanced-color images of Pluto (lower right) and Charon (upper left) was taken by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on July 14, 2015. The image highlights the striking differences between Pluto and Charon. Pluto and Charon are shown with approximately correct relative sizes, but their separation is not to scale. NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI Advertisement High-resolution images of Charon were taken by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft on July 14, 2015, and overlaid with enhanced color. Charon's cratered uplands at the top are broken by series of canyons, and replaced on the bottom by the rolling plains of the informally named Vulcan Planum. The scene covers Charon's width of 754 miles and resolves details as small as 0.5 mile. NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI Perhaps the most dramatic feature is a vast system of canyons that stretches more than 1,000 miles across Charon's face and likely onto the moon's far side.

In case you're wondering, NASA says that's four times longer than the Grand Canyon and in some places twice as deep. As Dr. John Spencer, a New Horizons scientist affiliated with the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in the statement, \"It looks like the entire crust of Charon has been split open.\u201d Advertisement The New Horizons spacecraft, now 3.1 billion miles from Earth, is still sending data about Pluto and its moons back to Earth. So, impressive as the new photos are, NASA says even better images are yet to come.

Pets May Help Improve Social Skills Of Children With Autism Pets May Help Improve Social Skills Of Children With Autism By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 4, 2015, 10:05 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Having a family pet can be beneficial for child development in a number of ways , including keeping kids active and promoting empathy, self-esteem and a sense of responsibility. But dogs may be particularly beneficial for kids with autism, acting as a \"social lubricant\" that helps them build assertiveness and confidence in their interactions with others, according to new research from the University of Missouri . The researchers surveyed 70 families with autistic children between the ages of eight and 18, all of whom were patients at the MU Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Nearly 70 percent of the participating families had dogs, half had cats, and some owned other pets including fish, rodents, rabbits, reptiles and birds. Advertisement The study's lead author Gretchen Carlisle, a research fellow at the University of Missouri, observed that autistic children are were likely to engage socially in social situations where pets were present. While previous research has focused specially on the ways that dogs benefit the development of autistic children , Carlisle found that pets of any type were beneficial for the childrens' social skills. \"When I compared the social skills of children with autism who lived with dogs to those who did not, the children with dogs appeared to have greater social skills,\" Carlisle said in a statement . \"More significantly, however, the data revealed that children with any kind of pet in the home reported being more likely to engage in behaviors such as introducing themselves, asking for information or responding to other people's questions. These kinds of social skills typically are difficult for kids with autism, but this study showed children's assertiveness was greater if they lived with a pet.\" Carlisle observed the strongest attachments between the children and small dogs, although parents also reported strong attachments between their children and other pets, such as cats and rabbits. Advertisement \u201cDogs are good for some kids with autism but might not be the best option for every child,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cKids with autism are highly individual and unique, so some other animals may provide just as much benefit as dogs. Though parents may assume having dogs are best to help their children, my data show greater social skills for children with autism who live in homes with any type of pet.\u201d Carlisle's research joins a body of work demonstrating the benefits of animal interaction among autistic children. A 2013 review of studies found that specially trained dogs, horses and other animals can facilitate increased social interaction and improved communication among autistic children, as well as decreased stress and problem behavior. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Prehistoric Puppy Could Provide Clues About Canine Evolution About 12,400 years after its death, this dog is having its day. By Ron Dicker General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Mar 17, 2016, 11:35 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have performed an autopsy on a frozen prehistoric puppy in hopes that its carcass will unlock secrets of canine evolution, The Siberian Times reported. Researchers believe the dog is about 12,400 years old and may have been a prehistoric man's pet before dying in a landslide near the Siberian village of Tumat. The animal was discovered mummified in permafrost last year. Advertisement This is the first well-preserved predator brain from the Pleistocene era that scientists have discovered, Dr. Pavel Nikolsky, a research fellow at the Geological Institute in Moscow, told The Siberian Times. \"The carcass is preserved really very well,\" Nikolsky said. \"And one of the most important things is that the brain is preserved.\" The puppy was found in 2015 close to where another one, believed to be its sibling, was discovered in 2011. YouTube Advertisement Having access to such a vivid sample of an early domestic dog could go a long way in determining how canines evolved. \"There are still important and incompletely resolved questions about how developmental patterns in early dogs differed from those of closely related (and ultimately ancestral) canid lineages,\" Daniel Fisher of the University of Michigan's Museum of Paleontology told The Huffington Post. \"We would like to know more about how and when the lineages that gave rise to dogs came to differ from their wolf relatives, and judging the age and stage of development of various features on a specimen like this could help to understand some of this history,\" he said. Advertisement Studying the ancient dog's intestinal contents, he added, could teach scientists about its diet, which in turn could indicate how much time it spent with humans. Researchers examine the puppy in Yakutsk, Russia. YouTube Hwang Woo-suk of South Korea was one of the researchers involved in the autopsy of the dog, which took place in Yakutsk, Russia. Although he once fraudulently declared that he had cloned a human embryo, he reportedly has had some real success cloning dogs and is interested in cloning the one discovered last year. Advertisement However, Fisher, who is familiar with the research but was not involved with it, said the chances of cloning even a well-preserved sample of the prehistoric pup are \"very slim.\" \"The problem is that even for tissues preserved in permafrost, the DNA is highly fragmented,\" Fisher said. \"Most permafrost is not as cold as would be ideal for preservation of fresh tissues, and the tissue was probably not frozen as quickly following death as would be necessary if cloning were to be practical.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Take A Spin Around Pluto In One Amazing Space Image A day in the life of the dwarf planet. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Nov 24, 2015, 10:45 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Ever wish you could spend a day on Pluto? Using photos taken from the New Horizons spacecraft, NASA scientists have created a composite image that depicts a full rotation of the dwarf planet. The images were taken during a close flyby in mid-July, when the distance between New Horizons and Pluto went from 5 million miles to just (well, \"just\") 400,000. Pluto spins much more slowly than our planet, taking about six and a half Earth days to complete a day of its own. Advertisement One highlight of the image is a glimpse of the dwarf planet\u2019 s largest bright surface. The \u201cheart-shaped\u201d feature, informally named the Tombaugh Regio , is visible in the bottom half of the frame, NASA says. Pluto was at its closest point to New Horizons at the time, making these the most detailed images. A day in the life of Pluto. NASA NASA also released a similar set of images showing Pluto's largest moon, Charon.

NASA Is Going To Burn One Of Its Ships And  Ignite A Giant Fire In Space Because, science. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Mar 17, 2016, 07:04 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA is fighting fire with fire. The space agency is launching the biggest man-made blaze in space. It's the first of a series of experiments in zero gravity designed to address what NASA project manager Gary Ruff calls \" one of the greatest crew safety concerns .\" On Earth, gravity gives fire a familiar structure, with colder, denser air falling to the base of the flame and heat rising. But without the organizing principle of gravity, flames in space can be very unpredictable. NASA plans to light the \" large-scale fire \" inside a cargo spaceship after delivering food, supplies and hardware to the International Space Station . Its commercial partner Orbital ATK is scheduled to launch the Cygnus cargo vehicle from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Tuesday. Advertisement The fiery fun begins two months later, as it heads away from the ISS and back toward Earth. Researchers involved in Spacecraft Fire Experiment I , also known as Saffire I, will remotely ignite a one by three-foot piece of material , a blend of fiberglass and cotton, inside a 3-by-5-foot module. Sensors and high definition video cameras will capture the action, with the valuable data eventually sent back to Earth. \"Saffire will be the biggest man-made fire ever in space,\" Ruff said in a statement. \"Currently, we can only conduct small combustion experiments in the microgravity environment of the space station. Saffire will allow us to safely burn larger samples of material without added risk to the station or its crew.\" Advertisement A Cygnus spacecraft approaches the International Space Station on Dec. 9, 2015. ASSOCIATED PRESS NASA aerospace engineer Dan Dietrich had previously told Smithsonian Magazine that there had been experiments earlier \"where we observed fires that we didn\u2019t think could exist, but did .\u201d David Urban, principal investigator, said in a statement that this and future Saffire experiments NASA has planned seek to answer two questions: Will an upward spreading flame continue to grow or will microgravity limit the size? And, what fabrics and materials will catch fire and how will they burn? Advertisement Once NASA has the data it needs from Saffire, Cygnus will reenter Earth's atmosphere and be destroyed in a second, and much larger, inferno.

New Study Finds Mindfulness Therapy As Effective As Meds Against Depression Relapse Mindfulness Therapy May Help Prevent Depression Relapse By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Apr 23, 2015, 07:36 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT woman admiring stillness of the ... Relapse is a common and devastating aspect of major depression, a mental illness that affects roughly 15 million Americans . The usual preventative treatment is long-term or maintenance use of antidepressants. Now a large new study published in The Lancet suggests that mindfulness therapy can be just as effective in preventing relapse. Advertisement The relapse rates are high: More than half of those who suffer from one episode of major depression will relapse at least once in their lifetimes, and roughly 80 percent of those who have had two episodes will experience another recurrence. Yet as Dr. Richard Byng, a psychologist at the U.K.'s Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry and one of the study's authors, noted , \"There are many people who, for a number of different reasons, are unable to keep on a course of medication for depression. Moreover, many people do not wish to remain on medication for indefinite periods, or cannot tolerate its side effects.\u201d The study, conducted from the U.K.'s University of Exeter, compared the results of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with those of maintenance antidepressant use among 424 adults with recurring major depression. Advertisement Researchers asked half of the participants to stay on their medications, while the other half tapered off medication and underwent a course of MBCT. Those in the MBCT group attended two-hour-plus weekly group sessions for eight weeks, consisting of guided mindfulness practices, group discussion and other cognitive behavioral exercises. They were also given daily home practice and, after the group sessions ended, had the opportunity to attend four follow-up sessions over the course of the next year. Regular assessments for major depressive episodes over the following two years found similar relapse rates among the MBCT group (44 percent) and the antidepressant group (47 percent). How does MBCT work? Using meditation, individuals learn to separate themselves from the sway of their immediate moods. They learn to recognize negative thought patterns and to respond productively, rather than spiraling downward into obsessive thoughts and relapsing into depression. Advertisement Dr. Zindel Segal, a University of Toronto psychologist and the co-developer of MBCT, explained that short-circuiting negative thoughts allows people to find joy in the present moment. \"MBCT, at its core, is teaching people to practice mindfulness,\" Segal, who was not involved in the study, told The Huffington Post. \"And what mindfulness teaches people is how to work more wisely with their emotions. It's a meditation that is really well suited to helping people encounter difficult states of mind and turning around how they work with them, so that they can choose more adaptive responses rather than habitual responses.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Segal expressed enthusiasm about the new findings, which he said offer further clinical evidence that mindfulness-based therapies can rival traditional psychotherapy and pharmaceutical intervention in treating major depression. Advertisement \"This study gives us a lot more confidence in telling people that if, for some reason, they can't stay on their antidepressants for the next three or five more years,\" said Segal, \"there is now a credible and scientifically supported alternative to help them stay well.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

This New Camera Shows You The Glow-In-The-Dark World Sharks See Biofluorescence could tell us more about how underwater animals and organisms communicate. By Jenna Amatulli Reporter, HuffPost Apr 26, 2016, 06:11 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Sharks are incredibly fascinating creatures. Wouldn't it be cool to see what they see? Well, researchers at the American Museum of Natural History have created a \"shark-eye\" camera that \"simulates how the shark sees underwater.\" The impetus for this was the discovery of a group of shy sharks -- catsharks, specifically -- who produce a bright green biofluorescence that does something unique, says a new study published Monday in Scientific Reports . The team noticed the sharks increase the contrast of their biofluorescent glowing pattern the deeper they travel underwater. The contrast makes them brighter, allowing the sharks to make themselves more visible to neighbors of the same species and possibly communicate with each other. Advertisement \u201cWe\u2019ve already shown that catsharks are brightly fluorescent, and this work takes that research a step further, making the case that biofluorescence makes them easier to see by members of the same species,\u201d John Sparks, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s Department of Ichthyology and a co-author of the study, said in a statement. Biofluorescence is when molecules in the skin of an organism absorb the blue-hued wavelengths of visible light in the water and re-emit them as other colors. This is not to be confused with bioluminescence, which is where \"the light itself is produced by the organism -- as it is via chemical reaction in fireflies.\" On the beach at Rannalhi, Maldivian island of the South Male Atoll. Bioluminescence is the production of light by a living organism. During the night, the beach comes alive with shining blue light brought ashore by the waves. Federica Grassi via Getty Images Advertisement Because a lot of what goes on underwater is invisible to the human eye, the goings-on within the biofluorescent universe aren't totally known. Using a technique called microspectrophotometry to determine how sharks\u2019 eyes absorb light, the researchers discovered that sharks have long rod pigments to help them see in environments without a lot of light. They used this information to develop the special camera filter that simulates how light hits a shark\u2019s eyes. As study author David Gruber, an associate professor of biology at Baruch College and a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, said in a statement: \"What does all this newfound biofluorescence we are finding in the ocean mean?\" The short answer is that they're working on it, but Gruber wonders if \"these animals [can] see other animals that are biofluorescing in the deep blue sea\" and, if so, what way they're using it. Advertisement The researchers recently also made the first observation of biofluorescence in marine turtles. Sparks said in a statement that all of these findings are \"a big step toward a functional explanation for fluorescence in fishes.\u201d So, while we're not totally sure why these animals are glowing and gorgeous, we're certainly enjoying that they are.

How Astronauts Respond To Emergencies In Space It can be a dangerous place. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 1, 2016, 10:34 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Space travel is risky business: Astronauts have to know what to do if depressurization, a fire or solar radiation suddenly endangers their spacecraft and crew. Great Big Story released a video on Monday (above) detailing the fascinating -- and surprising -- safety measures that astronauts are trained in so that they can handle emergencies. Advertisement For instance, if a solar flare has directed dangerous levels of solar radiation toward a manned spacecraft, the astronauts aboard that vehicle must retreat to a small room called \"the dog house.\" It's surrounded by water bags that absorb the radiation and prevent it from entering the room, former NASA astronaut Leland Melvin explains in the video. \"As astronauts, you're trained to not be alarmed by things,\" he says. \"You're trained to go into a mode of, 'How will I save the day? How will I fix this? How will I do all the steps required to make sure that we come home safely?'\" Watch the video to learn more about how astronauts prepare for space emergencies.

Watch A Year Flash Before Your Eyes From 1 Million Miles Away Guys, that's our whole world. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jul 20, 2016, 09:35 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT One year ago, NASA treated earthlings to a magnificent view of our home planet from a vantage point some 1 million miles away. Since then, the agency\u2019s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera \u2015 appropriately nicknamed EPIC \u2015 has captured thousands of dazzling photographs . And on Wednesday, NASA blew our minds again with the release of a stunning time-lapse image, built from more than 3,000 photos, showing a full year of Earth\u2019s dizzying dance. Advertisement EPIC, which is attached to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Deep Space Climate Observatory , takes a color image of the sunlit side of Earth about every two hours. The camera\u2019s vantage point allows it to view sunrise and sunset at least 13 times per day, as lead scientist Jay Herman explains in the new video. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Hurricane Joaquin Looks Totally Surreal From Space Scott Kelly is at it again. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Oct 2, 2015, 04:35 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Hurricane Joaquin isn\u2019t so pretty here on Earth , but from space, the rain-making, surf-churning Category 4 storm has a surreal, almost peaceful appearance. Just check out this photo posted at 10:22 a.m. ET today by NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, who is about halfway through his one-year stint on the International Space Station.

Joaquin has been blamed for at least two fatalities --and though it doesn't appear to be the superstorm some had feared, it's still raging. \"We're certainly very concerned about this situation,\" Bill Martin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina, told The Weather Channel this morning. \" We're expecting very high to extreme levels of rainfall over the next 48 hours.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Explore Mars In 360 Degrees With Rover's New Interactive Photo Curiosity captures the Red Planet in all its glory. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 31, 2016, 03:39 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Experience what life could be like on Mars with this awe-inspiring 360 degree photograph. NASA released the picture taken by its Curiosity Mars rover on Saturday, just a day after dazzling us with a stunning selfie beamed back from the Red Planet . The interactive image was posted to the car-sized explorer's official Facebook page : \"Use your smart phone to explore Mars with me in 360 degrees. #FromWhereIStand,\" the space agency said. Advertisement Viewers can maneuver the image, taken on the planet's Namib Dune, to take a closer look at sand grains, Martian rocks and NASA's probe itself. It has not yet been revealed exactly how the static shot, which appears to be slightly distorted in some places, was obtained. Some commenters speculate it's a composite of pictures taken by the Mars Hand Lens Imagers camera at the end of the rover's arm, much like the selfie released Friday: Advertisement NASA released this selfie taken by its Curiosity Mars rover on Friday. NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Curiosity previously sent back two other selfies -- here and here -- and stitched together a sensational panorama earlier this month. The probe first landed on Mars on Aug. 6, 2012. Its initial mission, since deemed a success after it discovered an ancient riverbed, was to \" determine whether Mars once offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life .\" Advertisement For the last two months, it's been scooping and sieving sand to investigate active dunes and how the wind moves on the Bagnold Dune field lining the northwestern flank of the planet's Mount Sharp.

SpaceX Rocket Lifts Off On Cargo Run, Then Successfully Lands At Launch Site Perched on top of the rocket was a Dragon capsule filled with nearly 5,000 pounds of food, supplies and equipment, including a miniature DNA sequencer. Reuters Jul 18, 2016, 01:40 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., July 18 (Reuters) - An unmanned SpaceX rocket blasted off from Florida early on Monday to send a cargo ship to the International Space Station, then turned around and landed itself back at the launch site. The 23-story-tall Falcon 9 rocket, built and flown by Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 12:45 a.m. EDT.

Also aboard the capsule was a metal docking ring of diameter 7.8 feet (2.4 m), that will be attached to the station, letting commercial spaceships under development by SpaceX and Boeing Co. ferry astronauts to the station, a $100-billion laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Advertisement The manned craft are scheduled to begin test flights next year. Since NASA retired its fleet of space shuttles five years ago, the United States has depended on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the station, at a cost of more than $70 million per person. As the Dragon cargo ship began its two-day journey to the station, the main section of the Falcon 9 booster rocket separated and flew itself back to the ground, touching down a few miles south of its seaside launch pad, accompanied by a pair of sonic booms. \u201cGood launch, good landing, Dragon is on its way,\u201d said NASA mission commentator George Diller.

'Screaming Mummy' Mystery May Have Finally Been Solved Who was he and why was he screaming? By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Feb 14, 2018, 04:48 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A mystery some 3,000 years in the making may have just been solved. While many Egyptian mummies look serene, one mummy has baffled scientists for the pained expression on his face. \u201c The gruesome mummy of Unknown Man E , also known as the \u2018Screaming Mummy,\u2019 has long puzzled scholars,\u201d Egyptologist and former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass told Al-Ahram Weekly. Advertisement Now scholars believe they finally know why the mummy looks so anguished: There\u2019s at least some chance he was, in fact, screaming at the time of his death. Hawass said DNA tests have confirmed a leading theory that the mummy was likely Prince Pentewere. He was sentenced to die and likely hanged for his role in the assassination of his father, Ramses III , who ruled in the 12th century BC. The screaming mummy was unusual for more than just the agonized look on his face. \u201cWe found this mummy covered in sheepskin ,\u201d Hawass told National Geographic in 2008. \u201cIn the mind of the ancient Egyptian\u2026 to cover with sheepskin means he was not clean, he did something [bad] in his life.\u201d Advertisement The mummy also had no grave marker, which according to custom at the time, would deny him a role in the afterlife. His hands and feet were bound and he wasn\u2019t given a traditional mummification process. \u201cHe was not even mummified, but was merely left to dry in natron and then had some resin poured into his open mouth,\u201d Al-Ahram Weekly reported. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Yet the mummy was found buried with other members of the royal family. \u201cTwo forces were acting on this mummy: one to get rid of him and the other to try and preserve him ,\u201d Bob Brier, an archaeologist at Long Island University who has examined the body, told The Sun. \u201cFor some reason, there was an attempt to make sure that he didn\u2019t have an afterlife, and in another attempt, somebody cared about him and tried to override that.\u201d Advertisement The mummy was recently put on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo as part of a special temporary exhibition showcasing parts of the collection that haven\u2019t been seen before. At least 20,000 visitors visited the screaming mummy when it went on display for a little more than a week, causing the museum to extend the exhibition, Egypt Independent reported.

Astronaut Tim Peake Completes London Marathon In Space, Sets World Record He ran the race in just over 3 and a half hours. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 25, 2016, 05:15 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Tim Peake appears live from the ISS for a Q&A session ahead of the London Marathon. The European Space Agency astronaut successfully completed the race on Sunday. Reuters After months of preparation , Tim Peake clinched an out-of-this-world achievement on Sunday: He became the first man (and second person) to complete a marathon in space. The British astronaut ran the London Marathon while strapped to a treadmill aboard the International Space Station. His final time? Three hours, 35 minutes and 21 seconds. Advertisement British astronaut @astro_timpeake runs the London Marathon \u2014 from space https://t.co/r8qoctzIdA https://t.co/VCzbud5ejO \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) April 25, 2016 The ISS reportedly traveled around the planet more than twice in the time that it took for Peake to complete the race. \u201cGonna sleep well tonight,\u201d the astronaut quipped on Twitter following his achievement. 42 km, while @Space_Station flew almost 100000 km. Congratulations to everyone in #LondonMarathon & #teamastronaut \u2026gonna sleep well tonight! \u2014 Tim Peake (@astro_timpeake) April 24, 2016 Advertisement According to The Guardian, Peake kept himself occupied during the race by watching TV coverage of the marathon and using an interactive app called RunSocial , which allowed him to participate in a digital version of the event.

As The Guardian notes, however, it\u2019s difficult to compare the two astronauts' times, as they ran with different harnesses under different loads. Advertisement Still, given the challenges of running such a long distance in zero gravity , Peake's achievement is notable. \"Tim has captured the hearts and minds of the nation since his mission on-board the International Space Station began last year,\" said Marco Frigatti of the Guinness World Records in a statement. \"His latest achievement is surely his greatest -- running the fastest marathon in space, on the only day-off from his gruelling schedule is fantastic accomplishment.

New Map Of The Brain Identifies 97 Previously Unknown Areas And are they gorgeous. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jul 20, 2016, 01:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The new map of the human cortex contains 180 distinct areas in each hemisphere. Matthew F. Glasser, David C. Van Essen If you ask a neuroscientist to show you a map of the brain, chances are they\u2019ll pick one that\u2019s more than a century old. In 1909, a German anatomist named Korbinian Brodmann published an intricate map of the brain\u2019s surface. He painstakingly stained brain cells of many kinds to find the anatomical features that set them apart and the rules that governed their layered organization. We now know that neurons that sense a touch on the skin are found in Brodmann area 1; those allowing you to read this article sit in area 17. Advertisement Now, scientists have built an updated map of the brain that further refines those areas. Published Wednesday in the journal Nature , the map reveals 97 previously unknown areas of the brain\u2019s surface (the cortex), in addition to 83 areas that were described before. Unlike Brodmann\u2019s and other brain maps built using just one property (how the cells looked under a microscope, for example), the new atlas is made by combining several types of data that capture multiple properties of these brain areas: their anatomy, their function and the connections between them. Advertisement The data was gathered using multiple non-invasive brain imaging measures from 210 people in the NIH Human Connectome Project , and the accuracy of the resulting map was confirmed on another group of 210 people. The study authors hope that \u201cresearchers who have previously used Brodmann\u2019s map to identify brain areas will use this new map from the Human Connectome Project instead,\u201d said Matthew Glasser of Washington University in St. Louis, the study\u2019s lead author. According to Glasser and his colleagues at six other research centers, combining anatomical data with functional data from fMRI brain scans has allowed for more precise delineation between brain areas. Advertisement For example, an area that may look indistinguishable from its neighbor under the microscope or on MRI scans may light up on fMRI scans that measure brain activation during a specific mental task and thus stand out as a distinct region. \u201cThe situation is analogous to astronomy where ground-based telescopes produced relatively blurry images of the sky before the advent of adaptive optics and space telescopes,\u201d Glasser said in a press release. An example of a map of brain activation used in building the brain atlas. The image shows brain areas that activate (red, yellow) and deactivate (blue, green) as people listened to stories while in the fMRI scanner. Matthew F. Glasser, David C. Van Essen Advertisement Researchers hope that a more precise division of the brain can prevent potential confusion in neuroscience studies that may be looking at overly broad areas \u2015 and lead to new discoveries. The map is a \u201clong-awaited advance,\u201d said B. T. Thomas Yeo and Simon Eickhoff, two neuroscientists not involved in the study, in an accompanying article in Nature. They added that it creates a reference atlas that allows neuroscientists studying various aspects of the brain to work within a common framework. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Science Explains Why The 5-Second Rule Is Actually True *As long as the food and surface are dry. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Feb 2, 2016, 09:27 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT You may not want to pick up and eat food once you've dropped it on the ground. But the five-second rule is actually a real thing when the item and the surface it falls onto are dry, according to the Discovery Science Channel's \"The Quick and the Curious\" show. As an experiment, NASA engineer Mike Meacham offered up cookies to strangers in a park. He then dropped the sweet treats onto the ground. Advertisement Only one man ate the gift, to the annoyance of the woman he was with. Bacteria jumps onto food as soon as it hits the ground. But the problems only begin when either the food or the surface is wet. iPandastudio via Getty Images The show's narrator said he'll be alright, though. That's because although small amounts of bacteria do hop onto food as soon as it hits the ground, the problems only really begin when the food and the surface are wet. \"Moist foods left longer than 30 seconds collect 10 times the bacteria than those snapped up after only three,\" the narrator said. Advertisement \"E-coli, salmonella and listeria love wet environments. They absorb water for the nutrients they need to grow and multiply.\" It's safer to spill food on carpets or rugs, because their tufts have less surface area to transmit germs. Adam Gault via Getty Images The type of surface onto which the food is dropped also accounts for how safe it is to eat again. It's better to spill food onto carpets and rugs, rather than linoleum, because their tufts have less surface area to transmit germs. Advertisement \"If you drop that cookie on dry ground, you should have plenty of time, the narrator said in summary. \"T he five-second rule is really the 30-second moisture and surface rule.\" So now we know.

The Surprising Link Between Gut Bacteria And Anxiety How Probiotics May Ward Off Depression And Anxiety By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jan 4, 2015, 10:05 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT In recent years, neuroscientists have become increasingly interested in the idea that there may be a powerful link between the human brain and gut bacteria. And while a growing body of research has provided evidence of the brain-gut connection, most of these studies so far have been conducted on animals. Now, promising new research from neurobiologists at Oxford University offers some preliminary evidence of a connection between gut bacteria and mental health in humans. The researchers found that supplements designed to boost healthy bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (\"prebiotics\") may have an anti-anxiety effect insofar as they alter the way that people process emotional information. Advertisement While probiotics consist of strains of good bacteria, prebiotics are carbohydrates that act as nourishment for those bacteria. With more evidence that gut bacteria may exert some influence on brain function and mental health, probiotics and prebiotics are being studied for the potential alleviation of anxiety and depression symptoms. \"Prebiotics are dietary fibers (short chains of sugar molecules) that good bacteria break down, and use to multiply,\" the study's lead author, Oxford neurobiologist Dr. Philip Burnet, told The Huffington Post. \"Prebiotics are 'food' for good bacteria already present in the gut. Taking prebiotics therefore increases the numbers of all species of good bacteria in the gut, which will theoretically have greater beneficial effects than [introducing] a single species.\" To test the efficacy of prebiotics in reducing anxiety, the researchers asked 45 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 45 to take either a prebiotic or a placebo every day for three weeks. After the three weeks had passed, the researchers completed several computer tests assessing how they processed emotional information, such as positive and negatively-charged words. Advertisement The results of one of the tests revealed that subjects who had taken the prebiotic paid less attention to negative information and more attention to positive information, compared to the placebo group, suggesting that the prebiotic group had less anxiety when confronted with negative stimuli. This effect is similar to that which has been observed among individuals who have taken antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication. The researchers also found that the subjects who took the prebiotics had lower levels of cortisol -- a stress hormone which has been linked with anxiety and depression -- in their saliva when they woke up in the morning. While previous research has documented that altering gut bacteria has a similarly anxiety-reducing effect in mice , the new study is one of the first to examine this phenomenon in humans. As of now, research on humans is in its early stages. A study conducted last year at UCLA found that women who consumed probiotics through regularly eating yogurt exhibited altered brain function in both a resting state and when performing an emotion-recognition task. Advertisement \"Time and time again, we hear from patients that they never felt depressed or anxious until they started experiencing problems with their gut,\" Dr. Kirsten Tillisch, the study's lead author, said in a statement . \"Our study shows that the gut\u2013brain connection is a two-way street.\" So are we moving towards a future in which mental illness may be able to be treated (or at least managed) using targeted probiotic cocktails? Burnet says it's possible, although they're unlikely to replace conventional treatment. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Oldest-Known Briton 'Cheddar Man\u2019 Wasn\u2019t Fair-Skinned After All DNA analysis of Britain's oldest complete skeleton reveals the first modern Britons had \"dark to black skin\" and dark hair. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 8, 2018, 08:24 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Scientists long believed that \u201cCheddar Man,\u201d Britain\u2019s oldest complete skeleton, was fair-haired and light-skinned. But according to new DNA analysis of his remains, he \u2014 and at least some of the first modern settlers of Britain \u2014 had dark skin and dark, curly hair . \u201cIt really shows us that these imaginary racial categories that we have are really very modern constructions, or very recent constructions, that really are not applicable to the past at all,\u201d Tom Booth, an archaeologist at London\u2019s Natural History Museum who was involved in the analysis, told The Guardian this week of the Cheddar Man findings. Advertisement Facial reconstruction of Cheddar Man, who had blue eyes, dark skin and dark, curly hair. Natural History Museum Cheddar Man\u2019s 10,000-year-old skeleton was discovered near the village of Cheddar in Somerset, England, in 1903. Researchers now say he was part of a group of hunter-gatherer immigrants from continental Europe who\u2019d settled in Britain shortly after the last ice age. Today\u2019s white Britons are descendants of that immigrant population \u2014 one that, until recently, had been assumed to be fair-skinned. But, by sequencing Cheddar Man\u2019s entire genome and reconstructing his face using cutting-edge techniques, scientists at the Natural History Museum and University College London have proved the assumption wrong. Advertisement \u201cCheddar Man had blue eyes, dark colored curly hair and \u2018dark to black\u2019 skin pigmentation . Previously, many had assumed that he had reduced skin pigmentation,\u201d the researchers said in a news release Wednesday. \u201cThe discovery suggests that the lighter pigmentation now considered to be a defining feature of northern Europe is a far more recent phenomenon,\u201d they added. The researchers, who extracted bone powder from Cheddar Man\u2019s ancient skull to conduct the DNA analysis, said their study offers insights into the origins of the Stone Age man. His ancestors, they said, left Africa and moved to the Middle East before heading to Europe and, finally, Britain. Advertisement About 10 percent of white Britons today can trace their ancestry to this ancient population, the researchers noted. DNA tests show 'Cheddar Man', the first modern Briton, had dark skin and blue eyes https://t.co/lf3fsF7XmZ pic.twitter.com/V2rxp5iBbi \u2014 AFP news agency (@AFP) February 7, 2018 Scientists involved in the research said they weren\u2019t entirely surprised by the findings. \u201cIt might surprise the public, but not ancient DNA geneticists ,\u201d Mark Thomas, a University College London scientist, told National Geographic. Advertisement Other recent genetic research , Thomas explained, shows that Europeans from Spain, Hungary and Luxembourg who lived during the same era as Cheddar Man also were dark-skinned. Questions remain, however, as to when and why Britons started to develop lighter skin. Some experts have suggested that ancient humans in more temperate regions were exposed to less sunlight, and therefore evolved to have lighter skin, which absorbs more ultraviolet radiation \u2015 necessary for the production of vitamin D. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How many of us have wondered, to paraphrase Ursula Le Guin, why we huddle about the campfire? A recent study poses an answer to this question by looking at what hunter-gatherers talk about as they sit around the fire at night.

How many of us have wondered, to paraphrase Ursula Le Guin, why we huddle about the campfire? A recent study poses an answer to this question by looking at what hunter-gatherers talk about as they sit around the fire at night. The question isn't so much why we sit around the fire, but how the ability to control fire changed human life. Evidence indicates that our ancestors began using fire one million years ago, and were using it regularly by 400,000 BCE. Control of fire had profound effects on human survival, anatomy, and subsistence. By providing protection from predators, it reduced mortality rates and may have contributed to the evolution of a longer lifespan. By increasing the digestibility of food, it contributed to the reduction in gut volume, which in turn freed up energy that could be applied toward further brain expansion. And through the use of controlled burning, it enabled our ancestors to regulate the timing, distribution, quality, and quantity of resources. But little is known about its cultural effects. By providing warmth and light, control of fire added several waking hours to the hunter-gatherer day, raising the question of what our ancestors did with these bonus hours. To address this question, Polly Wiessner compared 122 day and 52 nighttime conversations collected among Ju/'hoan hunter-gatherers in southern Africa. She found pronounced differences between daytime and nighttime conversation topics. Daytime discussion focused largely on gossip (34 percent), economic matters such as foraging plans, resource availability, and hunting strategies (31 percent), and joking sessions (16 percent). With the fall of darkness, however, an abrupt shift occurred, with 81 percent of talk consisting of stories. In contrast, storytelling constituted only 6 percent of daytime conversations. Although we can't know for sure what ancestral hunter-gatherers talked about as they sat around the fire, Wiessner's findings suggest that they primarily chose to tell stories. Is it possible that this extra time allotted to storytelling impacted subsequent human evolution? Advertisement Although it may sound farfetched, this question makes perfect sense in the context of the pronounced human ability to extract, manipulate, and share information. By two million years ago, our ancestors had begun colonizing a new feeding niche, shifting to foods with highly concentrated calories and nutrients, such as meat, tubers, and nuts. Since their primate heritage left them without the anatomical features used by other species to access these foods--e.g., sharp claws, powerful jaws, large canines, high-speed locomotion, a keen sense of smell--they used their large brains instead. They invented tools and strategies such as digging sticks, stone knives and hammers, projectile weapons, and tracking to bypass their anatomical limitations and gain access to these rich resources. But occupation of this new niche--known as the foraging niche --came with a price: the use of these tools and strategies required extensive knowledge of animal behavior, plant and mineral properties, weather, topography, route finding, and--because humans are highly cooperative animals--social rules. It is impossible for a person to learn everything needed to make a living as a hunter-gatherer through direct experience, so as humans adapted to this new ecological niche, they evolved a means of bridging the knowledge gap: social learning, or information sharing. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Learning through direct experience, or trial-and-error, is a slow and unpredictable process, because the appropriate learning experience might not occur by the time it is needed. Social learning circumvents this constraint by providing access to the experience of others--including the experience of previous generations. In so doing, social learning exponentially increases the amount of knowledge an individual can acquire by adulthood. For most of its existence, information sharing has been oral. We know this because ancestral H. sapiens emerged around 300,000 years ago, while writing emerged a mere 5,000 years ago and literacy did not become widespread until after the invention of the printing press in the 1400s. For most of their existence, then, humans have been sharing knowledge through the spoken word. Much of my research has investigated the proposition that, once storytelling emerged, it served as an important vector of knowledge transmission. One prediction that follows from this hypothesis is that hunter-gatherer oral tradition will recount experiences that contain information useful for addressing recurrent problems of hunter-gatherer life. In other words, we would expect to find cross-cultural patterns in story content, and we would expect this content to reference local solutions to problems posed by the foraging niche. This is indeed what we find: cross-culturally, forager oral tradition contains a wealth of information about animal behavior and characteristics, plant properties and growth habits, topography and landmarks, weather patterns, famine, warfare, child care, and social rules. Wiessner reaches a similar conclusion: \"Through stories and subsequent discussion, people collected experiences of others and accumulated knowledge of options that others had tried.\" She found that the bulk (60 percent) of evening conversation focused on social matters such as kinship obligations, marriage practices, meat sharing, land rights, gift exchange, and healing rituals. The remaining 40 percent focused on \"economic exploits such as hunting stories, close calls with wild animals, or adventures while traveling to other areas.\" Wiessner's study thus gives teeth to the claim that storytelling is an important medium of knowledge transmission in forager societies by showing that, in at least one forager group, people devote a considerable portion of their waking hours to this activity. Advertisement So how did all this extra time devoted to storytelling affect life in early human groups? One obvious possibility is that it stabilized existing knowledge by increasing opportunities for transmission, thereby preventing it from being lost upon the death of the individuals who possessed it. By the same token, it would have expanded the collective knowledge pool, as new information was acquired and shared. This in turn may have accelerated the rate of technological and cultural change, as time and energy formerly spent reinventing the wheel were redirected toward exploration and the dissemination of new discoveries.

Milky Way's Vast Galactic Plane Shimmers In Hypnotic New Video The Herschel Space Observatory offers an unprecedented look at our galactic home. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Apr 26, 2016, 05:17 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT To the naked eye, the Milky Way can seem little more than a whitish smudge stretching across the night sky -- at least if you're stargazing in the midst of a light-polluted city . But when observed by a powerful telescope positioned far out in space, our galactic home comes alive as a vast and very beautiful collection of glimmering celestial objects. Just take a look at this eye-popping new Milky Way video from the European Space Agency. It shows innumerable stars and proto-stars (infant stars) along with gigantic glowing filaments and luminous clumps of gas and dust. Advertisement And it all seems to go on forever. The video, released by the ESA last week, was created from observational data from the Herschel Space Observatory , a space telescope that was active from 2009 to 2013. The ESA probe spent more than 900 hours observing the Milky Way's galactic plane in five different wavelengths of light, and then scientists spent two years processing the data to make the \"maps\" used to create the video. Advertisement The galactic plane is where most of the stars in our disk-shaped galaxy are concentrated. In addition to awe-inspiring beauty, the imagery created by the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) provides a treasure trove of new information about the Milky Way. \"These maps are not only stunning from an aesthetic point of view, but they represent a rich data set for astronomers to investigate the different phases of star formation in our galaxy,\" Dr. Sergio Molinari, principal investigator for the Hi-GAL project, said in a written statement . An astronomer who wasn\u2019t involved in the research emphasized one particular aspect of the Herschel survey. Advertisement \"The unique aspect of imagery from the Herschel Space Observatory is the wavelength,\" Dr. Evan Kirby, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at CalTech, told The Huffington Post in an email on Tuesday. The wavelengths Hubble can see are not observable from Earth because our atmosphere is opaque at those wavelengths, Kirby said, adding, \"Thus Herschel is giving us a view of the Milky Way that is only possible through its position in orbit.\" Far out! | Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement Close From Our Partner What's Hot More In Science NEWS POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE VOICES HUFFPOST PERSONAL SHOPPING NEWSLETTERS About Us Advertise Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers User Agreement Comment Policy DMCA Policy HuffPost Press Room Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy Consent Preferences Privacy Settings Part of HuffPost Science. \u00a92025 BuzzFeed, Inc.
