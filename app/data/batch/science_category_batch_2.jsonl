Neil deGrasse Tyson Cites Celebrity Flat-Earthers To Make A Point About Politics \"You can say Earth is flat because we have free speech, but our Constitution doesn't grant that anything you say is correct.\" By Carla Herreria Russo Senior Editor, HuffPost Apr 21, 2017, 10:45 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Getty Famed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson knows the Earth is, in fact, round. Tyson also knows some people who share his level of celebrity don\u2019t agree with him on that. After vainly explaining to these celebs time and time again that the Earth is round, Tyson is trying a different approach. This time, he\u2019s showing how science deniers can be detrimental in government. Advertisement In a series of tweets on Friday, Tyson highlighted a larger problem that high-profile flat-Earthers (and other types of science deniers) create: They are bad influences on their fans and supporters. Tyson began by explaining that flat-Earthers who live in the U.S. are allowed to say whatever they want, truth or not. Constitutional rights don\u2019t make beliefs true, however. In a free country, it doesn\u2019t matter if you think the world is flat, provided you don\u2019t ascend to become head of @NASA . \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) April 21, 2017 Advertisement You can say Earth is flat because we have free speech, but our Constitution doesn't grant that anything you say is correct. pic.twitter.com/MY5c54RfOk \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) April 21, 2017 Tyson then turned his attention to the concept of what it means to be a pop star and, consequently, a role model. \u201cIf kids who are fans of pop-stars think Earth is flat because they do, then it exposes a flaw in the concept of Role Models,\u201d the astrophysicist tweeted. Advertisement If kids who are fans of pop-stars think Earth is flat because they do, then it exposes a flaw in the concept of Role Models. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) April 21, 2017 Unlike his past Earth-is-round Twitter rants , Tyson\u2019s recent tweets didn\u2019t appear to be in response to a freshly outed denialist celebrity. However, his comments do reflect another type of denialism that exists in a very influential place in America: the White House. Scott Pruitt , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, doesn\u2019t believe humans are the primary cause of climate change \u2015 a view that contradicts an estimated 97 percent of climate scientists . President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and has proposed deep cuts to NASA\u2019s budget for climate-change research in favor of space exploration. Advertisement Perhaps, in honor of upcoming Earth Day and the coinciding March for Science protests , Tyson was pointing to flat-Earthers to make a case against policymakers who are also science deniers, and argue for science to have a larger role in government. In fact, Tyson\u2019s flat-Earther tweets were posted after he published an essay titled, \u201cScience in America,\u201d arguing for just that. \u201cScientific truths emerge by consensus \u2014 not of opinion, but of observations and measurements \u2014 rendering the research that falls outside of consensus the shakiest possible grounds on which to base policy,\u201d Tyson wrote in his essay. Advertisement \u201cPolitics is not a foundation on which you base your science,\u201d he added. \u201cScience is a foundation on which you base your politics, lest you undermine a functioning, informed democracy.\u201d A Tyson tweet drove the point home: Show me a Nation with a science-hostile government, and I'll show you a society with failing health, wealth, & security. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) April 22, 2017 Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

The Early Bird Gets the Sperm ... to the Egg What gets you out of bed in the morning? Before morning has broken, and some time before blackbird has spoken, songbirds rise for sex. And a clever new experiment reveals just how important it is for male songbirds not to sleep in.

Before morning has broken, and some time before blackbird has spoken, songbirds rise for sex. And a clever new experiment reveals just how important it is for male songbirds not to sleep in. A great many species of songbirds nest in pairs, presenting to the world a facade of monogamy. Until the 1990's, songbirds were rhapsodised by social conservatives as paragons of family values, mother and father working together faithfully to fledge their demanding chicks. Until new genetic technologies revealed that most socially monogamous birds were playing a lot of away games. For a long time, ornithologists failed to spot the shennaniganising because most of it happens just before dawn, when even the hardiest birdo is still rubbing sleep from their eyes. That's actually a bit unfair: ANU's Professor Andrew Cockburn and his many collaborators have risen unspeakably early for decades to study Australia's superb fairy wrens, revealing them to be Olympic medallists of extra-pair sex . Female wrens leave the nest before dawn , heading straight to males singing in the dawn chorus . Advertisement This kind of behaviour gives male birds two reasons to rise early: to prevent their social mate from mating with another male, and perhaps to get a little bit on the side from some other male's social mate. European blue tit males who start singing early in the morning sire more chicks with other females, chicks he doesn't have to raise because the female and her social mate do all the heavy lifting. No wonder those Three Little Birds were cheerful when Bob Marley rose and smiled with the rising sun! Advertisement Consequences But how do early and late risers do with their social mates? A team based at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Radolfzell, Germany, found an ingenious way to answer this question. By inserting slow-release melatonin implants beneath the skin of free-living male Great Tits, just before the breeding season, they tweaked the birds' circadian rhythms. The body releases the hormone melatonin at night, and animal circadian activity patterns are cued by melatonin levels. Nocturnal animals are stirred into activity and dirurnal animals to sleep by rising melatonin. Early rising male Great Tits can get the sexy stuff over with and spend the res of the day looking fabulous. Israel Guti\u00e9rrez/flickr Advertisement Male great tits in the control group became active about 22 minutes before dawn, but those with melatonin implants took an extra ten minutes to get going. They were no less active during the day, and they stopped for the night at the same time, a few minutes before dusk. But those extra ten minutes cost the males dearly. Twelve percent of chicks fledged from the nests of control males were sired by another male, but 42 percent of chicks in the nests of melatonin-implanted males had been conceived with another male's sperm. As an early riser, I'd like to claim victory for the early birds at this point. But of course I can't. For humans, Sex at Dawn remains niche. Many even prefer to rise early for bird watching. Advertisement The night time is where the action is for our species. Night owls tend to be more extrovert, novelty-seeking, and night-owl men (but not women) report having more sexual partners. Night-owls are more likely than early risers to be single and open to short-term commitment-free sex. Being a night owl is associated with risk-taking in women on a levels similar to males (both night-owls and early risers). Risk-taking predicts short-term sexual behaviour, suggesting that female night owls might be especially oriented toward sex. Interesting, it's true, but not yet the basis for any firm prescriptions. Unless you're Charlotte Alter writing at Time Magazine . Anybody spot the implicit bias and rampant earlybirdophobia? Women who stay up late are more likely to get laid, but less likely to get married than women who get up early to do a sun salutation or whatever. Whatever indeed! Up all night to get lucky?

Conflict on the Surface: An Excerpt from <i>The Orbital Perspective</i> There are no passengers on Spaceship Earth, only crewmates, and we all have a responsibility to mind the ship and take care of our crew-mates. In fact, when we pull back temporally and look at long-term effects, it becomes apparent that we must collaborate, for the survival of life on Earth.

During my half year in space, I was moved by many other views of Earth from the windows of the space station besides the India-Pakistan border. One such scene occurred while we passed over the Mediterranean Sea. I was struck by the contrast of colors, the dark blue of the sea against the bright tans and reds of northern Africa, all framed by the curvature of Earth and its paper-thin atmosphere. I quickly grabbed a camera and started snapping away. As it happened, Libya was framed within the picture, which I took on August 24, 2011, the day that Tripoli fell during the Libyan Civil War. Looking at the photo, I found myself thinking deeply about what was occurring at the microscopic level within the frame of this beautiful scene. The violence and suffering that was imperceptible from the orbital perspective was all-encompassing when you zoomed into the details of the two-dimensional plane of the conflict. Advertisement Most of the many conflicts raging around the world involve complex factors of history, ethnicity, class struggle, poverty, religion, and so forth. Usually, these conflicts adhere to the ideology of scarcity; actions tend to be based on a fear that the other side might attempt to take control of material things such as water, land, oil, or some other resource. But for the most part, these conflicts are, at heart, two-dimensional conflicts. There exists an \"us\" and a \"them,\" and both sides tend to demonize and dehumanize the other. If one side gains, the other side loses. When we pull back to the orbital perspective, however, we see the field of conflict in a new light. We see combatants engaging in violence against each other in a small slice of an apparent paradise. Each side in an armed conflict tends to diminish the humanity of the other, but the orbital perspective provides the view that both sides are fully human, and that by degrading the human dignity of one we degrade the human dignity of all. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The currency of the orbital perspective draws upon the unlimited resources of respect, compassion, empathy, and creativity. If I offer compassion or share an idea, it doesn't lessen my supply of creativity or empathy. Those involved in conflict usually see their opponents as completely separate from themselves, but if those combatants could pull back to the orbital perspective and employ some elevated empathy, they would discover the unity and interconnectedness they were missing. If they were able to look at the long-term effects of their actions, they would see there's a better way forward. Advertisement This is really no different from the joint interests that led the United States and Russia to collaborate in space, or that enabled astronauts and cosmonauts to work together for their common survival in the face of fire or cabin depressurization. Pulling back to the orbital perspective helps us to realize that, like those space travelers, we're all riding through the universe together. There are no passengers on Spaceship Earth, only crewmates, and we all have a responsibility to mind the ship and take care of our crew-mates. In fact, when we pull back temporally and look at long-term effects, it becomes apparent that we must collaborate, for the survival of life on Earth.

New Tiny, Stunning Frogs From 'Sky Islands' May Be In Danger New Tiny, Stunning Frogs From 'Sky Islands' May Be In Danger By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jun 11, 2015, 02:11 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Seven dazzling new species of miniature frogs have been discovered on what scientists call \u201csky islands\u201d in Brazil. The frogs, which belong to the genus Brachycephalus, are all so small they can fit on the surface of a dime, according to Science News. Twenty-one Brachycephalus were known prior to this study. The most recently discovered of the tiny amphibians were found by scientists during a five-year study of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and are described in a paper published last week by journal PeerJ. The paper notes that the bright colors on several of the species indicate powerful neurotoxins in their skin. Advertisement (Story continues below.) The Brachycephalus species are spread out amount the states of Paran\u00e1 and Santa Catarina in southern Brazil, according to the paper, and are found on \"sky islands\u201d -- meaning mountains that are home to high-elevation, isolated habitats. The paper notes that this isolation means some of the frog species are totally isolated from one another, unable to travel from one high-elevation habitat to the next. That means some species of the frog only exist on one, or a select few, mountaintops in the world. The paper notes that the frogs\u2019 habitat may be in danger from deforestation, which mostly occurs in the area as a result of pine tree plantations and cattle ranching.

You might be happy to have it in your pasta water and your oceans, but in your friendly neighborhood freshwater lake , it\u2019s an unwelcome intruder. Unfortunately, salt is butting into lakes more and more frequently as humans move closer and closer to lakes, pouring increasing amounts of salt on the roads in the winter. In a study published Monday in PNAS , researchers looked at 371 lakes scattered across the northern United States and southern Canada from Minnesota and Michigan to Maine and Ontario, an area known as the North American Lakes Region. Advertisement The researchers scoured public records to find relatively large lakes (covering about 10 acres) with 10 years worth of data about the water body\u2019s chloride levels. Then they looked at the area surrounding the lake to see how many roads were nearby. If even one percent of the land surface within a buffer zone extending 1,640 feet from the lakeshore was paved, then the lake was extremely likely to have rising salinity levels. \u201cLakes are really good at showing long term environmental change,\u201d says lead study author Hilary Dugan. Unlike rivers, which tend to show salt contamination in steep spikes, lakes show a steady change over time. Many kinds of salt used on roads are chemically similar to table salt\u2014NaCl\u2014or sodium chloride. The presence of salt messes with water\u2019s ability to freeze into a slippery, icy layer on the roads in winter. But when the weather warms, all that salt gets washed off the impervious road surfaces, sidewalks, and parking lots. It ends up accumulating in the soil, and eventually getting washed out by rain and snowmelt into surface waters like lakes and streams as sodium and chloride components. Advertisement Just like having too much salt is bad for you, too much chloride can be bad for the environment . It can kill off plants , and make waters less hospitable for native plants and algae. Salt becomes noticeable in drinking water at about 300 milligrams per liter, or one teaspoon of salt in five gallons of water, says Dugan. That\u2019s when you start tasting the difference, and it\u2019s around that concentration that salt starts to put stress on freshwater plants and animals, which have adapted to live in extremely fresh water. Road salt impacts the environment in other ways as well. While on the road, it can attract salt-loving animals like deer, increasing the possibility of both roadkill and traffic accidents. Advertisement Chloride can also make water more corrosive. In Flint, Michigan , researchers found that the chloride from road salt made the water in the Flint River so corrosive that when the city switched water sources, the water ate away at the lead pipes , creating the ongoing water crisis . But there is still hope. \u201cThe good news is that we can always improve water quality,\u201d Dugan says. Unlike phosphorus or other pollutants that can lurk in sediments in a lakebed for long periods of time, chlorides stay in the water column, and can gradually be flushed out of a lake as new water enters the lake. \u201cIf you improve the water going into a lake you have the potential to freshen the lake,\u201d Dugan says. Daunted by the rising price of salt , governments have already started to adopt more conservative salt-use measures, only using the amount necessary to ensure public safety. But homeowners can help cut back too. A single 12 oz coffee cup is all you need to salt a 20-foot length of driveway. Dugan also recommends only salting at temperatures that you know will be effective. Below 15 degrees Fahrenheit, dry salt on a surface is useless, and won\u2019t prevent ice from forming. Advertisement Dugan says that while this is the largest study of its kind\u2014analyzing salinity levels in lakes across a broad region\u2014there are still plenty of questions to answer, including what happens over time as conservation measures are put in place, and people start using less salt. We started sprinkling salt on the roads back in the 1940\u2019s and have kept at it ever since. That\u2019s tons of salt lurking in the environment, in soils and other surfaces. Even if we start making changes to how we handle winter weather, it will take awhile to get all that salt out of our systems. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

LEAVE A COMMENT It\u2019s hard to believe that 92 years after the Scopes Monkey Trial (which debated teaching evolution in public schools), the integrity of the science community is in politically charged territory. The reality of climate change, possibly the greatest concern of the 21st century, is challenged by those who refuse to accept findings which indicate that the world is warming. Advertisement There is an ongoing effort to refute that human activity has been a key driver in the \u201cgreenhouse effect.\u201d For stakeholders in the fossil fuel industry, facts pointing to human-produced climate change is an impediment to their agenda. With greater fossil fuel carbon in the air, more heat is returning to earth. Arctic sea ice is decreasing, oceans are rising, extreme weather is frequent, birds and other species are changing their behavioral patterns. Advertisement The new head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt , has maintained that the science of climate change is \u201cfar from settled.\u201d What\u2019s a scientist to do, beyond present the facts? March! Scientists and supporters of science will do just that at the March for Science on April 22, Earth Day. Science needs a higher profile in our country. Currently, studies show that America lags woefully behind in graduating science majors. Stats underscore that America ranked number 38 out of 40 countries. In 2012, President Obama set the goal of increasing STEM graduates by one million by 2022. Advertisement Unfortunately, science isn\u2019t considered \u201csexy.\u201d When featured in news stories it too often doesn\u2019t get the eyeballs (except glazed). That\u2019s about to change \u2014 the tagline for the march is, \u201cScience, Not Silence.\u201d The organizers state: \u201cThe mischaracterization of science as a partisan issue, which has given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence, is a critical and urgent matter. It is time for people who support scientific research and evidence-based policies to take a public stand and be counted.\u201d There are several core principles featured, with the purpose of bringing key positions to the forefront: Advertisement Science serves the common good and should be \u201cfree from manipulation by special interests.\u201d Science education is essential. (That includes encouraging girls and people of color to go into the STEM fields!) Communication of scientific facts to the public should be freely accessible. (The recent gag orders on government scientists, web page deletions, and disappearing of data are of utmost concern.) National policy should result from evidence-based findings, and regulations should serve the public interest. The federal budget should \u201creflect the powerful and vital role that science plays in supporting our democracy.\u201d The march is also looking to place the important work of scientists within the context of daily life. They want to contribute to a vibrant dialogue of ideas without retribution . Ironically, people throughout the country are not as disconnected from the scientific facts as might be believed. A Quinnipiac Poll from February 8 found that American voters are aware of the crucial environmental issues facing the country \u2014 and the world. Advertisement By a margin of 2\u20131, they said that Trump should not cut regulations to combat climate change. 50 percent don\u2019t believe that the Keystone or Dakota Access pipelines should be resumed. 72 percent are \u201cvery concerned\u201d or \u201csomewhat concerned\u201d about climate change. 59 percent believes that \u201cmore needs to be done to address climate change.\u201d 61 percent oppose removing special regulations intended to combat climate change. Hundreds of thousands of science supporters have signed up to volunteer or participate in the Science March in DC and satellite marches are planned for other cities in America from Alaska to Arkansas, and globally from Paris to New Zealand. The best way for parents and their kids to ensure science will influence policy is to show up to support not only unfettered truth, but also to mobilize for the necessity of cutting-edge science education in their schools.

Grave Of Mysterious 'Sleeping Beauty' Discovered In Ethiopia Mysterious 'Sleeping Beauty' Grave Discovered By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 11, 2015, 08:18 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Archaeologists working in Ethiopia have discovered a remarkable treasure trove of artifacts dating back to the first and second centuries -- including the skeletal remains of a mysterious woman that some are calling \"Sleeping Beauty.\" \u201cShe was curled up on her side, with her chin resting on her hand, wearing a beautiful bronze ring,\" Louise Schofield, a former curator at the British Museum in London and the leader of the excavation, said of the woman, the Guardian reported. \"She was buried gazing into an extraordinary Roman bronze mirror. She had next to her a beautiful and incredibly ornate bronze cosmetics spoon with a lump of kohl eyeliner.\u201d (Story continues below image.) The grave in Ethiopia where the woman dubbed \u2018Sleeping Beauty\u2019 was discovered. Advertisement The woman's remains and the artifacts were found in one of 11 uncovered graves discovered in May during a six-week excavation near the northern town of Hawzien , Schofield told The Huffington Post in an email. The excavation site is about three hours southeast of Aksum -- an ancient city that was once the capital of the Aksumite kingdom, a large trading nation that lasted from the first through the eighth centuries. Perfume flask found in another grave at the site. In addition to elaborate necklaces, iron bangles, glass vessels, and clay jugs, the site yielded artifacts from the Roman Empire. That suggests that Romans and Ethiopians were trading much earlier than previously thought . Advertisement \u201cEthiopia is a mysterious place steeped in legend, but nobody knows very much about it,\u201d Schofield told the Guardian. \u201cWe know from the later Aksumite period \u2013- the fourth and fifth centuries, when they adopted Christianity \u2013- that they were trading very intensely with Rome. But our finds are from much earlier. So it shows that extraordinarily precious things were traveling from the Roman Empire through this region centuries before.\u201d The artifacts will go on display in October in a new German-funded museum in Wukro, a town located about an hour from the excavation site.

Another Extremely Rare Venomous Sea Snake Washes Up On California's Coast This is only the fifth time a yellow-bellied sea snake has been found in California. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Dec 21, 2015, 06:51 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT An extremely rare yellow-bellied sea snake is seen after washing ashore south of Los Angeles on Friday. Lisa Gonzalez/Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County For the second time in just two months, an extremely rare venomous sea snake has made a surprise appearance on Southern California's coastline, suggesting that the abnormally warm temperatures of the local waters are attracting species that would have once given the area a miss. A dead yellow-bellied sea snake, of a type commonly found throughout the warmer Pacific and Indian Oceans, washed up Friday along Bolsa Chica State Beach, about 30 miles south of Los Angeles, according to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Advertisement A different yellow-bellied sea snake was spotted in Oxnard, north of L.A., in late October. Experts suspect both snakes were in the region because of the warming waters brought by El Ni\u00f1o. The Oxnard snake died soon after it was discovered. The Natural History Museum, whose herpetology curator, Greg Pauly, helped handle the snake at Bolsa Chica State Beach, called it an \"exciting find,\" noting that the species is almost never seen so far north. The snake, also known as Pelamis platurus, is common in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Friday's discovery is said only to be California's fifth documented sighting. Encyclopaedia Britannica via Getty Images Advertisement \"This is an exciting find and an important addition to the Museum collection -- the two snakes are the northernmost records for this species in the Eastern Pacific, and only the fourth and fifth documented records of this species along the Pacific Coast of Baja and California, ever. All 5 records are from El Ni\u00f1o years,\" the museum wrote on its Facebook page Monday. Environmentalists cleaning the beach with the Huntington Beach chapter of the Surfrider Foundation took credit for Friday\u2019s unusual find. \"We're rarely surprised anymore by the things we find during our beach clean-ups but this one was a shocker!\" Surfrider wrote on its Facebook page Saturday. Advertisement Posted by Surfrider Foundation on Saturday, December 19, 2015 \"Words of wisdom for those who like to play with snakes -- don't touch, it's highly venomous,\" the foundation advised. It's shaping up to be an exciting month for herpetologists. On Monday, scientists in Australia announced the discovery of two other rare sea snakes -- one of which was previously thought to be extinct. Advertisement Two healthy short-nosed sea snakes were recently photographed in the water along Australia's Ningaloo Reef, in what scientists say is the first sighting of this species in 15 years. Two critically endangered short-nosed sea snakes were recently photographed off Australia's west coast. The species hadn't been seen in 15 years, scientists say. Grant Griffin, W.A. Dept.

Rare Photo Captures Sprites, Gravity Waves Over Hurricane Matthew The luminous flashes last only milliseconds and appear at random, making them extremely hard to capture. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Oct 4, 2016, 06:15 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A photograph showing the sky above Hurricane Matthew on Saturday captured rare red bursts of light, called sprites, as well as faint gravity waves in the sky above it. Frankie Lucena A series of extremely rare bursts of light lit up the night sky near Puerto Rico over the weekend, creating a spectacular display that one eagle-eyed photographer was fortunate to capture. At least 28 of these electrical discharges called sprites flashed directly above thunderstorms brought by the barreling, category 4 Hurricane Matthew on Saturday, photographer Frankie Lucena told The Huffington Post. Advertisement In addition to the unique lights, one of his photos managed to capture gravity waves \u2015 not to be confused with gravitational waves \u2015 directly above the flashes as well. Steven Miller, an atmospheric researcher at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere at Colorado State University, confirmed the extremely faint lines \u2015 which resemble ripples \u2015 after looking at satellite images. Sprites, as magical as they may sound, are rare, massive but weak luminous flashes associated with thunderstorms, according to researchers at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Powerful lightning flashes trigger the sprites. Advertisement The first photo evidence of sprites was snapped by accident in 1989, according to the Geophysical Institute\u2019s website. The reason it took so long for them to be documented likely rests with how infrequently they show up and how difficult it is to capture them on film. \u201cCapturing sprites isn\u2019t easy. You might go through your entire memory card and have nothing but stars.\u201d - Frankie Lucena, photographer Though it\u2019s not impossible to see sprites with the naked eye, their flashes, which last for as long as just 10 milliseconds, appear at random and in only about 1 percent of lightning strikes. They also only appear above active thunderstorms, meaning the viewer must be at some kind of elevation or angle that allows them to see over the clouds, according to the Geophysical Institute. Advertisement Lucena said it\u2019s also possible to capture them if you\u2019re far enough away from the storm, like he was. \u201cCapturing sprites isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Lucena told HuffPost via email Monday. \u201cYou might go through your entire memory card and have nothing but stars, so it helps to have a little luck on your side also.\u201d This satellite image shows the photographer's location (top right) as well as the site of the gravity waves, lightning flashes and the eye of Hurricane Matthew. CIRA Advertisement Lucena, however, apparently got extra lucky with his photo as it also shows gravity waves above the sprites. \u201cYou can see the ripples going through the sky that are caused by the gravity waves passing through,\u201d Miller, the atmospheric scientist, told HuffPost Tuesday of Lucena\u2019s photo. \u201cThey\u2019re very faint. They almost look like stripes.\u201d As Miller explained, gravity waves are the result of energy moving between the various layers of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. He said Lucena\u2019s photo captures them above the mesosphere, which is the third highest layer of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. To put that into perspective, it\u2019s directly above the troposphere (where humans live and most weather formation occur) and the stratosphere (where commercial jets fly). Advertisement \u201cAt the top of the mesosphere, about 50-60 miles up, is this level of the atmosphere that\u2019s glowing,\u201d he said of the unique photograph. \u201cA lot of energy gets released and it releases these gravity waves that propagate up and away from the storm,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a lot of heat being released by this hurricane. It\u2019s like a big heat engine. ...It\u2019s just an indicator of the power of this storm.\u201d @DeborahWAPA Red sprites taken last night while Hurricane Mathew was near Aruba and Colombia. pic.twitter.com/lBvZj20rZS \u2014 Frankie Lucena (@frankie57pr) October 1, 2016 Advertisement Though gravity waves \u201chappen all the time,\u201d Miller said, they\u2019re not often photographed. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen many examples where somebody has been able to see them above a cyclone like this hurricane,\u201d he said. Lucena shared some of his tips on how to photograph sprites. \u201cYou have to know where to aim the camera and you do that by either looking for the flashes of lightning in the distance or by checking the lightning maps [online] ,\u201d he said. The skilled photographer, who said he\u2019s been capturing the marvelous spectacles since 2010, said he sets his camera to continuous shooting so he\u2019s able to capture the sprites just as they flash. Advertisement In a YouTube video posted on Sept. 21 of another sprite sighting, Lucena shows what a difference speed makes while photographing a \u201cjellyfish sprite\u201d that appears at a regular speed and then slowed down. \u201cYou have to do test shots first using different settings to make sure you don\u2019t over or under expose the night sky,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lens is also important because you need a wide aperture to help capture the red.\u201d Advertisement In another video Lucena posted to YouTube in late August, he captures the illuminating effect of the bright red sprites\u2019 light on the night sky. \u201cI used a photo taken just 2 seconds before the sprite appeared to [create] this animation,\u201d he said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It's a big time at NASA. Scientific probes are sailing through our solar system, gathering legions of data and amazing photographs. Rovers are crawling all over intriguing extraterrestrial bodies, boring little holes into their surfaces and gathering samples. By Clayton Anderson, Contributor U.S. Astronaut (Ret.); Author of The Ordinary Spaceman; ISS and Space Shuttle spacewalker; Aquanaut U.S. Astronaut (Ret.); Author of The Ordinary Spaceman; ISS and Space Shuttle spacewalker; Aquanaut Jun 8, 2015, 02:03 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Scientific probes are sailing through our solar system, gathering legions of data and amazing photographs. Rovers are crawling all over intriguing extraterrestrial bodies, boring little holes into their surfaces and gathering samples. The Hubble Space Telescope is rewriting astronomy textbooks, almost single-handedly. Scientists and engineers are designing new space vehicles, gigantic rockets and cutting-edge technology engines. Commercial companies are battling it out for the privilege of delivering astronauts -- both professional and tourist -- into space. And oh, did I mention we're 50-plus years old? I am proud of NASA and what she stands for. I am prideful to have served as one of her employees, roaming the hallowed halls of the Johnson Space Center over a career that spanned 30 years. Oh sure, I was fortunate enough to finally become an astronaut, but the pride I share in this storied government agency stems from so much more. Advertisement NASA continues to be a solid investment. Yep, that's right, an investment. Most don't realize how our measly individual tax dollar/year contributions have led to thousands of paybacks, borne of the brilliance contained within her ranks. From power tools to invisible braces; from improvements in jet engine efficiencies to enhanced eye surgery techniques, NASA has been there, and -- with our continued support -- will remain. And that should make Americans extremely proud. The perception that our space program disappeared with the mothballing of her space shuttles, or thoughts that what we do is a waste of taxpayer dollars, couldn't be further from the truth. Aside from the aforementioned spin-off paybacks, NASA continues to represent accomplishing the impossible and creating a sense of awe and wonder. Are we continuing to teach our children to understand this pride? Do we challenge them to look to the skies and dream of executing feats now deemed improbable? In my opinion, not nearly enough. There will be those who will challenge this post. They will cite the need to \"spend these dollars on Earth.\" They will claim there are too many needy people on this planet to be \"throwing money away in outer space.\" Advertisement But I challenge them to look at the facts . And when they pull out their cell phone, fall asleep on their temper foam mattress and pillow, strap into their Air Jordan basketball shoes, or drink purified water from any available source, they should yell at the top of their lungs, \"Thank you NASA,\" and be proud. I can't wait to see what we'll have accomplished when she turns 100!

Elon Musk's SpaceX Has Company In The Race To Mars Gentlemen, start your engines. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Oct 5, 2016, 05:00 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg announced his company will reach Mars before SpaceX does. Jim Young/Reuters Just when you thought Elon Musk \u2019s plan for putting humans on Mars seemed ambitious, or even far-fetched, the world\u2019s largest aerospace company has promised to get there first. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg didn\u2019t say whether his company planned to beat SpaceX\u2019s target date of 2025 , only that it would reach Earth\u2019s planetary neighbor before Musk\u2019s SpaceX does. Advertisement \u201cI am convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,\u201d Muilenburg said Tuesday at an innovation conference in Chicago. And just like that, the race for Mars is on.

It is clear Musk is serious about getting to Mars. In fact, in his announcement last week he said his main motivation for accumulating assets is to make the biggest contribution possible toward becoming interplanetary. As for timelines, however, Musk admitted he\u2019s \u201c not the best at this sort of thing .\u201d Advertisement Boeing is working with NASA to build a new, powerful rocket. Known as the Space Launch System, or SLS, it is designed for deep space missions , including Mars and beyond. According to goals outlined in the U.S. National Space Policy, NASA hopes to send astronauts to Mars at some point in the 2030s. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Neil DeGrasse Tyson Fact-Checked The New 'Star Wars' Movie And fans were quick to accuse him of ruining the fun. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 21, 2015, 07:06 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT While Neil deGrasse Tyson admits that the new droid in \u201c Star Wars: The Force Awakens \u201d is \u201c waaaaay cuter \u201d than R2-D2, he points out that the smooth metal spherical ball would have \u201c skidded uncontrollably on sand .\u201d The famed astrophysicist is known for offering his observations and critiques of scientific movies. He did the same for the record-breaking new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie in a series of tweets on Monday. My promised observations of @StarWars Episode VII #TheForceAwakens follows (with only mild spoiler alerts). \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 Advertisement While not all of Tyson's tweets were specifically scientific critiques -- the Stormtroopers, he said, \"still run as though they\u2019re carrying a full load of poop in their diapers\" -- Tyson made clear that when it came to the facts, he was mostly unimpressed. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens the TIE fighters made exactly the same sound in the vacuum of space as in planetary atmospheres \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens , the energy in a Star is enough to destroy ten-thousand planets, not just a few here & there. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 Advertisement In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens , apparently Wookiees don\u2019t age, or they age much slower than human actors do. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 Unashamed of inanity, #TheForceAwakens repeats the Millennium Falcon boast of completing the Kessel Run in \"under 12 parsecs\" \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 ( A Parsec is an obscure unit of distance in Astrophysics, equal to 3.26 Light Years. Neither has anything to do with time. ) \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 Advertisement But before you conclude that Tyson was trying to destroy the fun with his facts, he did give the movie some scientific approval. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens , the starry skies were unfamiliar. As they should be, a long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 As for the diet of the movie's heroine, a scavenger named Rey, Tyson seemed to approve. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens , the lead character snacks on what includes Romanescu Broccoli, nature\u2019s only fractal food. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 Advertisement Never seen Romanescu Broccoli? Fractal Earth food befitting a tale of long ago and far, far away. pic.twitter.com/NZDkWpeqOB \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 21, 2015 Tyson has a long history of fact-checking Hollywood movies -- from \"Gravity,\" \"Star Trek\" and \"Armageddon\" to \"Titanic\" and even \"Pitch Perfect.\" Recently, he took to Twitter to tackle what \"Back to the Future II\" got right and wrong in its predictions about Oct. 21, 2015. While Tyson's tweets about the latest \"Star Wars\" may have been in good fun, they rubbed many fans the wrong way. Advertisement . @neiltyson @StarWars I think most of us understand that the \"science\" in \"science-fiction\" has air quotes. \u2014 Loren (@rescuethecows) December 21, 2015 @neiltyson @starwars Oh really? And what happens when you suck all the fun from a science fiction movie? :P \u2014 Uri Goldstein (@urig) December 21, 2015 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Watch Octopuses Meet for Blind Date, Tricky Sex On February 14, Hazel and Franklin will meet for a blind date. There is a good chance things will get heavy; it will likely be the first -- and possibly the last -- chance either has for sex in their adult lives. There is also a small chance Franklin will get eaten.

Image courtesy of Creative Commons/Michael Bentley/Flickr On February 14, Hazel and Franklin will meet for a blind date. There is a good chance things will get heavy; it will likely be the first -- and possibly the last -- chance either has for sex in their adult lives. There is also a small chance Franklin will get eaten. A team of scientists is bringing Hazel and Franklin, two lonely adult octopuses, together for a brief tryst this Valentine's Day. And, yes, you can watch . These three-year-old, 40-plus-pound giant Pacific octopuses ( Enteroctopus dofleini ) will be introduced during the Seattle Aquarium's annual \" Octopus Blind Date .\" The large and powerful cephalopods, which can be cannibalistic, are usually housed separately. But on Saturday, the barrier between their watery enclosures will come down, and the two will be able to meet, sucker to sucker. Their public poikilothermic rendezvous is a hot ticket at the aquarium's Octopus Week -- and is also streamed online via webcam (starting at 3 p.m. EST, noon PST) for curious viewers across the globe. Advertisement In the wild these intelligent and sneaky animals usually pair off only once in their short, three to five years of life . And that is if they can find a mate in the vast ocean. But these lucky two octopuses have a unique chance to get lucky this weekend. As you might imagine, however, the business of octopus sex -- with 16 arms, thousands of suckers, no bones and a penchant for cannibalism -- can be a bit tricky. And unlike many other cannibalistic animals, the octopus requires internal fertilization. To make things even more challenging, the male lacks a penis. So how does he get the job done? With one of his arms -- a specialized limb that is equipped to penetrate the female's body through her funnel and then deliver sperm packets. After mating, the female will store the sperm until she is ready to lay eggs -- which can be up to several months later. But will the octopuses get cold, er, arms, with all those prying human eyes on the other side of the glass? The live -- and online -- audience hasn't seemed to kill the mood for previous pairs. Last year Ace and YoYo -- each weighing in at about 40 to 50 pounds -- sealed the deal in full public view. In 2013 the female Squirt made the first moves on male Rain before the two successfully mated. And 2012's pair, a large female named Mayhem and a small male named Rocky, consummated their fleeting relationship while Barry White played in the background. Advertisement After their brief time together, Hazel and Franklin will be released by divers into nearby Puget Sound (Hazel on February 15 and Franklin on February 22 -- also live-streamed online, at 3 p.m. EST and noon PST). There they will be able to live out the rest of their lives in the wild -- and perhaps contribute their Valentine's Day baby giant octopuses to the sound.

NASA's Time-Lapse Video Capturing Five Years On The Sun's Surface Is Simply Spectacular Five Years On The Sun's Surface Captured In Spectacular Time-Lapse Video By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 15, 2015, 10:28 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Since its launch in February 11, 2010, NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory has been busy watching the sun, capturing an image of the magnificent star more than once per second. And now it has taken some 200 million images of the sun to date. The images have given scientists and lay people alike the extraordinary opportunity to observe exactly what happens on the sun\u2019s surface. For instance, most recently, a massive, dark line -- called a solar filament -- was spotted snaking across the sun's surface. Advertisement In celebration of the observatory\u2019s fifth anniversary on Wednesday, NASA released a spectacular time-lapse video (above), featuring some of the highlights from the last five years of the observatory\u2019s solar-watching. \u201cWatch the movie to see giant clouds of solar material hurled out into space , the dance of giant loops hovering in the corona, and huge sunspots growing and shrinking on the sun's surface,\u201d NASA scientists said in a written statement. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

(Still) Waiting for the Big One The sun is a stormy star that, across the centuries, has gifted our Earth with some incredible moments of calamity. Telegraph and radio technologies and even satellites and human safety have been placed in the breach of near-destruction. Is there a major \"superstorm\" in our future?

The sun is a stormy star that, across the centuries, has gifted our Earth with some incredible moments of calamity. Telegraph and radio technologies and even satellites and human safety have been placed in the breach of near-destruction. Is there a major \"superstorm\" in our future? The Past as Prologue What would you do if the sky turned blood-red all night, and so bright that you could read newspapers by this ghastly sky? What would you think if, for a day, all communications out of the country ended, or your cellphones stopped working? How do you think people would respond if their electrical power went out for several days or longer... in the hot air-conditioned summer? A solar storm in the making (Credit: NASA/SDO) Yawn... This is usually how scientists start this discussion of potential impacts that solar storms can have. The end result is still the same old public indifference. You can't really blame the public. These kinds of events seem so very remote from this morning's newspaper headlines of the last major snowstorm or hurricane. Most of us have never even seen an aurora, but most of us have all experienced the deadly consequences of a severe rainstorm, flooding or snowstorm. On a scale from 1 to 10, solar storms are irrelevant. Even worse, when they arrive, they are a festive event as people flock outside to admire the pretty colors in the sky. No matter how strenuously scientists and engineers try to elevate public concern about solar storms, the reality is that there is not one single documented case of anyone ever dying from a solar storm! Advertisement It Sucks to Be a Space Weather Forecaster But people don't have to die to make a compelling news story. Over the last 200 years, every technology we have deployed has been affected by solar storms, which in many cases have crippled our social network of communications and electrical power distribution. The fact that you, personally, were never there to experience the hubris and social calamity of what these storms were like is irrelevant. The last major power outage happened in the legendary blackout in Quebec in 1989, but we have had several near-misses since then that would have taken down the entire North American power grid. Whether or not you are an aficionado of the old-style telegraph and short-wave communication systems, the outages visited upon the public by solar storms over the last century still provide a cautionary tale. The sun is still a stormy star, and our communications networks are still vulnerable to failure during a major storm. It's really all a matter of luck. The major solar storm of July 23, 2012, would have been a social catastrophe had it been ejected from the sun merely a week earlier. Earth lucked out in that it was in the wrong part of its orbit. And it was merely luck. The sun produces several of these \"superstorms\" every 11 years. Like Clint Eastwood said, \"Are you feeling lucky?\" Advertisement Headline story from 1941(Credit:New York Times) Historical record is a great place to go to see how our parents and grandparents dealt with solar storm events. The New York Times used to print these stories on the front page for over a century, until the 1950s. Then they were quietly relegated to the less-traveled sections of the paper or ignored entirely. If you want to read more about the personal experiences of people living through the last 200 years of solar hubris, have a look at the books like Solar Storms: 2000 Years of Calamity for an eye-opening tour of some of the great moments recorded in newspapers and diaries since the 1800s. It includes a litany of critical technologies routed by Mr. Sun, and a sense of the sheer psychological terror that people felt as their skies turned blood-red. You will read about people going insane thinking the world was about to end. You will hear about the successful bombing raid of London by the Nazis thanks to the illumination of the aurora. There are also many documented stories of lost submarines, failed satellites, and power failures to round-out the story. That Was Then... This Is Now Yeah, I know. You are probably asking yourself, \"Why should I care, today, about how people felt yesterday?\" Because for as long as there have been humans, we have always wanted to predict what our future experiences will be like. This practical curiosity about the future has saved our butts countless times over the centuries and millennia. With space weather we are in the same boat. It is a new phenomenon, much like tornadoes were to early western settlers of North America. To them, learning about yesterday and family tales of past tornado encounters helped them survive and anticipate the next-seasons events. Advertisement Scientifically, we know that strong space weather storms can shut down electric power grids, give you a dose of radiation as you fly to Paris, or shut down that specific satellite that gives you your GPS location or tells you about that snowstorm about to cover your house with a foot of snow. Because humans today are no different in temperament from those who walked the streets a century ago, we can learn a lot about likely human behavior today by looking backwards at how people reacted in previous storms. It's all there, written in the newspaper stories, and a dramatic testament to human misunderstanding, superstition and fear. Computer model of an approaching storm (Credit: NOAA) But in some cases we see the emergence of breathtaking islands of wisdom and calm. This didn't happen by accident but because scientists painstakingly figured out how the whole space weather phenomenon works. The earliest news reports from the 1800s actually featured a wizened astronomer describing how telegraph outages and the Northern Lights were caused by sunspots. Over the course of a few more decades, instruments were developed that could watch the sun for particularly nasty-looking sunspots and sound an alert. This was especially important during World War II, when the D-Day Invasion was timed to take place when the sun was least active. Once solar physicists and geophysicists got their hands on some very cool data during the Space Age and access to supercomputers, their predictive abilities improved by leaps and bounds. The sun still randomly generates these storms, but now we can give several-day advanced notice. There is still nothing we can do about these storms other than get our vulnerable technology \"out of the way,\" so when they inevitably happen, you and I will still react to them as humans. A major superstorm capable of taking down our society for weeks or months is still a reality, but like the inevitable Great California Earthquake everyone is waiting for, all we can do is prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

Fly Around Ceres In This Dramatic New NASA Video Spectacular Video Lets You Fly Around Ceres By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Jun 9, 2015, 08:25 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA has released a dramatic new video of the dwarf planet Ceres (above). The black-and-white animation lets viewers fly around the mysterious orb from an altitude of 8,400 miles, compressing the nine-hour Cererian day into 75 seconds. It was assembled from 80 images taken by the space agency's Dawn spacecraft . \"We used a three-dimensional terrain model that we had produced based on the images acquired so far,\" Ralf Jaumann, a Dawn team member with the German Aerospace Center in Berlin, said in a written statement. \"They will become increasingly detailed as the mission progresses--with each additional orbit bringing us closer to the surface.\" Advertisement (Story continues below diagram.) Diagram showing path taken by Dawn spacecraft. Just don't believe everything you see in the video, which was posted to YouTube on June 8, 2015: NASA doubled the vertical dimension and added a star field in the background. Dawn was launched in 2007. It spent 14 months studying the rocky protoplanet Vesta before entering orbit around Ceres on March 6, 2015 . | Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement Close From Our Partner What's Hot More In Science NEWS POLITICS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE VOICES HUFFPOST PERSONAL SHOPPING NEWSLETTERS About Us Advertise Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers User Agreement Comment Policy DMCA Policy HuffPost Press Room Accessibility Statement Privacy Policy Consent Preferences Privacy Settings Part of HuffPost Science. \u00a92025 BuzzFeed, Inc.

You Might Miss a Whale, or Even a Whale of a Bright Idea Like the Laser What if Dr. Townes, instead of taking that timeout, had sent a text or played Angry Birds? Might we be in the dark about the laser? As research and Townes' example suggest, the unpredictable sparks of our own mental machinations should be something we don't want to miss any more than the majestic sight of a passing whale. By Ben Hellwarth, Contributor Author and Journalist Author and Journalist Feb 13, 2015, 11:05 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Charles H. Townes, Columbia University professor and Nobel Laureate, explains his invention the maser during a news conference in New York City, Jan. 25, 1955. The maser, microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, uses directly the energy radiated by molecules of ammonia gas. (AP Photo) A ton of fun is being poked online at the unnamed guy caught on camera sitting on a sailboat, fixated on the screen of his cellphone. What he's obviously missing, as the picture by photographer Eric Smith shows , is the sight of the breaching humpback whale right alongside the boat. We may sneer at his inattention, but this image is really a teachable moment for us all, simply because we're all guilty of some form of cell-centric behavior. Advertisement Every time we choose to stare into our little screens or nervously fiddle with our phones, whether for a second or an hour, we risk missing whatever may be happening immediately around us -- like, say, the breach of a whale, or, more ominously, a car that unexpectedly stops right in front of ours. Using a phone while walking is proving to be problematic too , and not just because of missing spectacular scenery (think stairs, escalators, walls, motorists checking their cellphones). The other side of this cellular coin is that we may also be missing out on what's going on in our very own heads -- or what would be going on if we weren't busy talking, texting, tweeting, emailing, gaming, Googling, scrolling through Facebook and watching cat videos. These phones we carry -- and check as often as we might scratch a pesky itch -- are about much more than making and receiving calls, although there's that too. Oh, wait just a sec; I've gotta take this call-- Sorry! That was my cat's agent calling about this awesome video gig! Just another sec; I should probably tweet that. (Don't worry! I'm not walking or driving.) Advertisement Anyway, the point is that these pocket-sized supercomputers we call smartphones and carry everywhere we go (admit it: You've texted while toileting!) can interfere with allowing our minds to simply wander. A variety of studies have made a case for unstructured mental downtime , and some tout the benefits of outright boredom , which is why it seemed oddly poignant that the image of that phone-fixated sailor began circulating around the same time as the obituaries for the esteemed physicist Charles Townes , who died Jan. 27, six months shy of his 100th birthday. While never a household name on the order of Einstein, Charlie Townes was a major figure in 20th-century physics, a Nobel laureate credited with, among other things, laying the scientific foundation for the development of the laser, a device that's become an indispensable tool in settings from supermarket checkout counters to surgical suites. Townes often told the story about how he came up with the idea for the predecessor of the laser, called the \"maser,\" for \"microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.\" (\"Laser\" stands for almost the same thing, only with an \"l\" for \"light.\") It occurred to me that if that picture of the whale-missing man is worth a thousand words, Townes' story is certainly worth a few too. Better yet, we should enshrine it in our multitasking, cell-centric culture. Call it a Townes timeout. Advertisement As Townes told me during an interview in the mid-1990s at his longtime UC Berkeley office, the story was simply this: He and his colleagues had been stymied in their maser quest until a possible solution crystalized in Townes' mind rather unexpectedly one day in 1951. He was in Washington, D.C., away from his 10th-floor lab at Columbia University, to chair a conference about such problems as how to create something like a maser, which could have a variety of useful applications. The affable scientist got up early in the morning, before the day's meeting, and effectively allowed his mind to wander as he himself wandered the short distance from his hotel over to Franklin Square. It was a fresh spring day, and Townes sat down on a park bench, taking time out to admire the blooming azaleas. As he sat there, allowing his neurons to fire at will, he hit on a critical insight about how to produce an orderly, tightly focused beam of microwaves. That in itself would be a breakthrough, and if they could achieve this feat with microwaves, then they should be able to do it with higher-frequency light waves and produce the now-familiar laser beam. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So in many ways the laser was born on that park bench, which is why, especially after the whale picture surfaced, I couldn't help but wonder: What if Dr. Townes, instead of taking that timeout, had taken a phone call, or checked his email, or sent a text, or played Angry Birds? Might we be in the dark about the laser? Maybe or maybe not. And I realize that even if the rest of us take a Townes timeout to allow ourselves some cerebral downtime, we may be unlikely to have Nobel-worthy revelations. Nonetheless, as research and Townes' example suggest, the unpredictable sparks of our own mental machinations should be something we don't want to miss any more than the majestic sight of a passing whale.

Newly Discovered Exoplanet With Extreme Seasons Called A 'Real Maverick' Scientists Discover Super-Rare Alien Planet By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 15, 2015, 10:05 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Two groups of astronomers working independently in Germany have discovered a massive new exoplanet that's quite strange--for a few reasons. The newfound exoplanet, dubbed Kepler-432b , was monitored by NASA's Kepler space telescope from 2009 to 2013 and identified as a planetary candidate in 2011. Using the 2.2-meter telescope at Calar Alto Observatory in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain and the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma in the Canary Islands, the researchers are now confirming that, indeed, it's a planet. Advertisement (Story continues below image.) lllustration of the orbit of Kepler-432b (inner, red) in comparison to the orbit of Mercury around the Sun (outer, orange). The red dot in the middle indicates the position of the star around which the planet is orbiting. The size of the star is shown to scale, while the size of the planet has been magnified ten times for illustration. Analyzing the data from both telescopes, the researchers discovered Kepler-432b is incredibly dense; though it's around the same size as Jupiter, its mass is six times that of the gas giant. Its orbit around its host star, a red giant with a radius that's four times that of our Sun, is also unusual. \u201cThe majority of known planets moving around giant stars have large and circular orbits,\" Dr. Davide Gandolfi, an astronomer at Heidelberg University's Center for Astronomy in Germany and a researcher involved in the discovery, said in a written statement. \"With its small and highly elongated orbit, Kepler-432b is a real \u2018maverick\u2019 among planets of this type.\" Advertisement Due to the orbit's elongated shape, Kepler-432b's seasons are extreme, with temperatures ranging from 932 degrees Fahrenheit in winter to 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit in summer. A year on the planet corresponds to roughly 52 Earth days, according to the researchers. And the planet is only one of five observed orbiting a red giant host star at such a close distance. Red giants are stars in their last stage of life. They can grow to become anywhere from 10 to 100 times their original size, and as they grow, any planets nearby are at risk of being devoured. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So though Kepler-432b has been able to survive near its star so far, it likely won't be around for much longer. Advertisement \u201cThe days of Kepler-432b are numbered,\u201d Mauricio Ortiz, a PhD student at Heidelberg University who led one of the two studies of the planet, said in the statement. \u201cIn less than 200 million years, Kepler-432b will be swallowed by its continually expanding host star.\u201d Two papers describing the discovery have been published in the January 2015 issue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Third Whale This Year Dies At SeaWorld San Antonio The 18-year-old orca had been sick for months. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Dec 22, 2015, 02:05 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT jordantea/Flickr An 18-year-old killer whale has died at a SeaWorld park in San Antonio, marking the third time this has happened this year. Officials say the whale, Unna, had contracted a harmful strain of fungus and was under constant care from park veterinarians. She was receiving a \" first-of-its-kind \" treatment plan and there was hope she was recovering, but ultimately she succumbed to the illness. Advertisement \u201cThis is an extremely difficult day for the SeaWorld family and all of Unna\u2019s many fans,\u201d Chris Bellows, vice president of zoological operations, said in a statement. SeaWorld canceled all whale shows at the Texas park on Monday in Unna's honor. Two other whales have died at the San Antonio park this year. A 2-year-old beluga named Stella died unexpectedly in November and a young calf died in July . SeaWorld has been the object of intense scrutiny for over a year, following the release of the documentary \"Blackfish.\" The company has been dealing with an ongoing public outcry and plunging ticket sales, and has announced that it will end traditional killer whale shows at its San Diego park in 2017 . Advertisement But the traditional show will be replaced by another, \"more natural\" experience that will still include captive whales . Meanwhile, at the company's other parks in San Antonio and Orlando, Florida, business will continue as usual. Conservationists have long urged the park to free its whales and called for an end to its captive breeding programs. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The March For Science Is A March For Democracy The March For Science Is A March For Democracy By Shawn Otto, Contributor Writer, Speaker, Science Gladiator, Politico Writer, Speaker, Science Gladiator, Politico Apr 18, 2017, 02:17 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT The upcoming March for Science is in many ways a March for Democracy, and if you like freedom and equality, or at least what\u2019s left of them, you should march in support of science. That\u2019s because science is the foundation of democracy. The ideas of science were critical to America\u2019s founders\u2019 battles to beat back the authoritarianism of King George. Benjamin Franklin was a scientist. Thomas Jefferson was a scientist and lawyer. Benjamin Rush was a scientist and physician. George Washington stressed the importance of science in the first State of the Union address. This is because for freedom to survive, it has to be based on the idea that there is such a thing as objective reality that we can all turn to to settle arguments of fact. And what creates that objective reality? Evidence from science. Without it, we are left with arguments being won by the person with the biggest stick, the fattest wallet, the most violent mob, or the most ardent religious followers. Given how these authoritarian alternatives played out over the centuries, the idea of a democracy based on science seemed pretty good to our nation\u2019s founders, and it should to us too. Advertisement In 1776, when Jefferson was writing the Declaration of Independence, he turned to his three idols\u2014the scientists Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, and John Locke. He synthesized their thinking into a simple but compelling argument: that if anyone could discover the truth of something for him or herself using the tools of reason and science, then all men are created equal, and no king, no pope, and no wealthy lord had any more right to govern than the people themselves. It was self-evident. In turn, attacks on science weaken the foundation of the notion of a shared objective reality on which democracy depends to function. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in politics today. As attacks by ideologues and industry have been broadcast by a news media trained that there is no such thing as objectivity, we have become paralyzed, and our government is at risk of failing. Massive anti-science public relations campaigns whose sole purpose is to forestall or reverse evidence-based legislation their funders don\u2019t like have the side effect of undermining the public requirement that politicians stick to the facts. The public relations strategy has seven distinct steps to create \u201cuncertainties\u201d and manipulate the media. They are used in every industry where this happens: tobacco, fossil fuels, pesticides, sugar, mining, and others. Advertisement It goes like this: Fund and create fake science that uses cherry-picking, p-hacking, and other statistical tricks to create a counter narrative that can form a basis for creating public uncertainties about the real science, then publish it in fake journals, which is easy to do online. Direct slanted press materials to bloggers whose websites pay them per click and encourage them to attack the integrity, conclusions and motives of the respected scientists in the field; use the attacks and blog posts to drive the manufactured controversy into the mainstream press. Fund and create industry-aligned front-groups to \u201cwhip up grassroots anger and frustration\u201d about the \u201ccontroversy\u201d and the limits to freedom the real scientists\u2019 findings will supposedly cause; then hold demonstrations and publicity events. Hire contrarian scientists to proselytize about the \u201cuncertainties\u201d of the legitimate science to professionals and influencers in the local communities of the member of Congress you are trying to influence, and to appear in committee hearings on the topic. Once in the press, push the story by placing opinion pieces in papers and booking advocates on television shows to discuss the \u201ccontroversy.\u201d Work with sympathetic legislators to craft bills that address the \u201cproblem,\u201d limiting or rolling back regulations and legislation based on the evidence because of the appearance of a controversy, and arguing that any action is premature. At this point representatives of the \u201cinnocent\u201d corporations that have been funding the attacks can safely step out from behind the curtain and testify on the bill, showing how its adoption would cost American jobs and reduce freedom. The method has been used so successfully for so long that science has come to be viewed by many political leaders as just another special interest or ideological view, which can be regarded as partisan and dismissed. We hear cries of how liberal scientists with a socialist agenda want to control your life and limit your freedom. \u201cWhy should we fund science at all?\u201d is the logical conclusion of such a train of thought, and so we are now seeing drastic, historic cuts proposed. Advertisement Two things bear remembering: Science is never partisan. It\u2019s very method is designed to cull what we know away from our many biases. But science is always political. Science creates knowledge; knowledge is power, and that power either confirms or challenges somebody\u2019s vested interests, which is always a political act. And there\u2019s the rub. But the dangers of denial are immense. In Germany in 1920, deniers of the theory of relativity mounted ad hominem attacks against Albert Einstein, branding general relativity as a \u201choax,\u201d and denouncing its Jewish nature. \u201cThis world is a strange madhouse,\u201d Einstein wrote a friend at the time. \u201cCurrently every coachman and every waiter is debating whether relativity theory is correct. Belief in this matter depends on political party affiliation.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Super-Colossal Space Tail Is Way Bigger Than The Milky Way Astronomers say the ribbon-like structure is more than twice as long as our home galaxy is wide. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Dec 23, 2015, 11:21 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Animals have tails. So do shirts, kites and comets. But you've never seen a tail like the one just discovered with the help of NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory space telescope. The luminous tail was observed streaming behind a distant galaxy in the galaxy cluster Zwicky 8338 -- and it spans a distance of at least 250,000 light-years. That's more than twice the diameter of our own Milky Way , which is home to our sun and more than 100 billion other stars . In this composite image, blue areas represent X-ray emissions and yellowish regions represent visible light. X-ray: NASA/CXC/University of Bonn/G. Schellenberger et al; Optical: INT Advertisement The apparent gap between the tail and the galaxy, known as CGCG254-021, suggests that the galaxy has been completely stripped of its gas. \"In effect, the tail has been cut off from the galaxy,\" study co-author Dr. Thomas Reiprich, also from the University of Bonn, said in the statement. Big as it is, the tail is no match for the so-called Cold Spot , a stupendous cosmic bubble of sorts that astronomers say is some 1.8 billion light-years across. The Cold Spot may be the largest structure in the universe. Advertisement A paper describing the tail was published in the November 2015 issue of the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.

Down the drain Down the drain By Sally Brown, Contributor Soil scientist, chef, swimmer Soil scientist, chef, swimmer Oct 1, 2016, 02:28 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. For the first time in my life I live in a place with an in sink garbage disposal. I can take my food scraps, run the water and have them magically ground and sent through the sewer pipes to the wastewater treatment plant. There are enormous potential for resource recovery at these facilities. Here I am referring to both the potential energy in the food scraps and the nutrients and carbon that can be returned to the soil (to grow more food). And much of that potential is being realized. However, most of that recovery happens at the end of the treatment train. Putting your scraps into the sink and expecting their value to be realized at the end of the pipe is in many ways a pipe dream. It sounds good on paper but there are a number of factors that make the reality very different from the concept. Here are a few. The first reality is the fact that if I take a significant portion of my food scraps and put them down the drain I will have a backed up sink and a busted disposal unit. I would not recommend you try one of those things on avocado pits, chicken bones or even too much left over pasta. Sour chocolate milk is one thing; high solids and/or heavy solids and grease are a whole different ball game. If you change your perspective from what is good for your sink to what is good for the planet, you also realize that this convenience should be used as a back up plan rather than as your first defense. From your sink your scraps make the long journey to the wastewater plant through the sewer system. I like sewers and I love wastewater treatment. The sewer system was home to one of my long time favorite characters- if you haven't seen Art Carney in the Honeymooners- you really should. Advertisement Despite my fondness for these systems, they are far from perfect. Sewer system are generally very old and as a result, can be very leaky. That means that what you put down there expecting it to get to the treatment plant may get leaked/ lost along the way. Much of the discussion of aging infrastructure this political primary season can be applied to our wastewater collection systems. Some of the liquid that you put down those pipes turns to solids and can clog the already tired systems. Here I am talking about things like bacon fat, one component of what is called FOG (fats oils and grease) http://beta.greshamoregon.gov/city/city-departments/environmental-services/wastewater-division/template.aspx?id=13792 Much of your scraps can be eaten en route to the plant. Not only by sewer rats but also by sewer microbes. I am not saying that rats should go hungry- I loved Ratatouille (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/ ), I am just saying that creating energy and recycling nutrients are higher priorities for me. Advertisement Once the material gets to the plant it goes through several processes before going to anaerobic digestion. Here is a link to a video showing the whole process (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5DUy3SMaU) Screening removes any artichokes leaves that have made it through the journey intact. The solids from screening go to landfills- minimal energy recovery, no nutrient recovery. Then the water moves to secondary or aerated treatment. Here oxygen is pumped through the wastewater to get rid of carbon. Much of the nitrogen is also lost. This is necessary to make the water clean but it is a real waste if you are thinking about resource recovery. It uses energy to waste the energy contained in the wastewater. This approach has given us clean water but it is highly energy intensive. Only after most of this energy is wasted does the energy recovery process actually begin. Anaerobic digestion and solids recovery and use are great. We just need to reroute the journey from the sink and through the plant directly to those digesters to make this a true case of resource recovery. There are examples of wastewater plants accepting food waste at the plant and putting it right into digesters. Waco, TX is a leader here (https://www.biocycle.net/2010/05/17/anaerobic-digestion-of-high-strength-organics-solves-treatment-plant-challenges/). I was one author on a report done for the State of Oregon that evaluated different ways to recover the value from food scraps. In sink digesters were rated low in that report with direct digestion and composting both ranked much higher. If you want more detail- here is a link to the full report : http://www.oregon.gov/deq/LQ/Documents/SWdocs/FoodReport.pdf Advertisement In other words, think of in sink digesters as a convenience to be used sparingly rather than as a tool to save time and the planet.

Our Economy Depends On Earth Observation And Scientific Research Our Economy Depends On Earth Observation And Scientific Research By Steven Cohen, Contributor Professor in the Practice of Public Affairs, Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs Professor in the Practice of Public Affairs, Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs Apr 17, 2017, 08:23 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT Since the mid-1970s I have studied and worked as a practitioner in the areas of environmental policy and public management. In helping to build the academic field and profession of sustainability management, I have had the opportunity to combine these areas of study. One of the founders of the field of management was a brilliant and practical man named Peter Drucker. A famous \u201cDruckerism\u201d is: \u201cif you can\u2019t measure something you can\u2019t manage it.\u201d Without measurement, you can\u2019t tell if your management decision-making had made the situation better or worse. In order to measure something, you must observe it. Earth observation is a central need of sustainability managers. Is the air getting cleaner? Are there toxics in the fracking fluid? Is our waste leaking toxics? Is the water safe to drink? If not, why not? What is the source of the pollution? Here at Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute, a great resource for answering these questions is our Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. That scientific powerhouse is situated on a beautiful campus twenty miles north of New York City overlooking the Hudson, has a $100 million endowment, but remains largely dependent on winning highly competitive federal science grants for most of its annual budget. Columbia\u2019s scientists are world-class and win many of the competitions they enter, but the amount of funding available is now threatened by the president\u2019s proposed budget. The effort to add to the military budget without increasing the deficit, raising taxes, or cutting entitlements threatens to destroy this critical earth observatory and institutions like it at research universities all over America. The cuts are not limited to earth science. Medical research is also cut by the proposed federal budget. Advertisement Our security is threatened by crazy people with weapons, but it is also threatened by human impacts on our planet that we either ignore or do not yet understand. There is a great deal about the natural world that scientists do not understand and are working hard to observe, analyze and explain. Human population and our impact on the planet continues to grow. The three billion people that lived on this planet when I grew up now number seven and one half billion. Our technology has advanced, our economies have grown, and our impact on the planet has never been greater. If we are to continue to grow our economy without destroying the planet\u2019s basic systems that sustain human life, we need to learn a great deal more about our planet and the impact of human activities on natural systems. As we learn more, our ability to manage those impacts grows and that in turn enables us to direct our economic activities in ways the cause the least possible damage. Human damage to the environment cannot be avoided or eliminated\u2013but it can be managed. That management requires that we learn more about the earth\u2019s ecological systems. We know how to measure some of the impacts that we have on our air, land and water. But our ignorance is staggering. Advertisement So too is our ingenuity, creativity and ability to deploy the scientific method to increase our understanding of earth systems. But scientific expertise costs money. We need labs, supplies, equipment, ships, vehicles, satellites, drones and people trained to use this equipment to collect and analyze data. We need computing power and highly educated scientists to build computer models that use data to project impacts. We need to attract the world\u2019s best minds to our laboratories and we need to provide them with the tools they need to learn, invent, and problem-solve. The United States government has been the largest source of funding for scientific research in world history. Starting with land grant college-based agricultural research in the 19th century, to wartime research during the 1930s and 1940s and peaking during the space and munitions race of the mid 20th century, America\u2019s research laboratories have been a central part of American economic and military power. Medical research, materials research, engineering, earth systems science, computer science and dozens of other fields of study have transformed the world we live in. That has all been put at risk by an administration that does not appear to support government funding of science. As Jeffrey Mervis observed recently in Science magazine: \u201cThe new president is no fan of research, and his administration has no overarching strategy for funding science. Deep proposed cuts to research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) offer evidence that Trump doesn\u2019t see science\u2014of any kind\u2014as a spending priority. And along with neglect there\u2019s indifference. The budget blueprint says nothing about spending at the National Science Foundation (NSF), for example. It\u2019s also silent on the research portfolios of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, although science advocates are not sanguine about their prospects.\u201d For climate science, indifference would be a step forward, since several new appointees to the Trump Administration have expressed hostility toward climate science and climate scientists. People who completely deny the facts of human-induced climate change, see no reason for additional \u201cfraudulent\u201d research. People who believe that climate science is \u201cinconclusive\u201d might well see additional research as a method for reducing uncertainty, but seem to believe that the money might better be returned to the taxpayers or spent on something more useful. We live in a world transformed by technology and that transformation shows no sign of slowing down. Your household and auto are increasingly managed by computers. Information and communication keep getting less expensive. America\u2019s research universities are a key part of this nation\u2019s comparative advantage in the global economy. When linked to government and corporate laboratories our science establishment remains capable of stunning achievements. But it is under attack. The intense demand for short term profits has destroyed many corporate laboratories and cuts in federal funding could impair university-based research. Discouraging immigration also makes it more difficult to attract the world\u2019s top scientists. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Despite these threats, America still retains tremendous scientific assets. Our universities are funded by states, cities, private individuals, philanthropy and their own intellectual property. The federal government is a critical and irreplaceable source of funding, but it is not the sole source of revenue. America also has a culture of individual freedom and support for exploration and risk taking that is essential to creative, path-breaking science. Our culture remains not simply achievement-oriented, but attracted to novelty and innovation. Advertisement Scientists are attracted to Columbia\u2019s Earth Institute and our Lamont campus because it brings them into an exciting intellectual community of like-minded researchers and educators. In the case of the Lamont campus, many of our scientists take a bus every day and reverse commute from their apartments in Manhattan to their laboratories in Rockland County. They endure traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge for the opportunity to interact with their colleagues. This phenomenon is repeated in great universities from MIT to Georgia Tech, from the University of Texas to Berkeley and Stanford. One of science\u2019s great contemporary challenges is presented by the public\u2019s demand for economic growth. The internet has enabled people in the developing world to see and demand the lifestyle we enjoy in the developed world. The world\u2019s peace and stability requires that this demand for development be met. Sustainable economic growth requires a deeper understanding of human impact on the planet and the invention of technologies designed to reduce that impact. These inventions are on the way: from anaerobic digesters to process food waste to solar cells and batteries that enable people to power their homes without fossil fuels. The process has begun. But the basic science that\u2019s required for sustainability management requires government subsidy. That funding is now under threat and it is very important that proposed cuts to the federal science budget be restored before the budget is finalized.

Neil deGrasse Tyson: Science Deniers In Power Are A Profound Threat To Democracy \"You don't have the option to say you don't believe E=mc2. It's true whether or not you believe it.\" By Mary Papenfuss Trends Reporter, HuffPost Apr 21, 2017, 08:54 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The U.S. grew from a \u201cbackwoods country\u201d to one of \u201cgreatest nations the world has ever known\u201d thanks to science \u2014 but that pillar of America is eroding, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson warns. Science deniers \u201crising to power\u201d now create a \u201crecipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy,\u201d Tyson says in a powerful new video that he promises contains \u201cwhat may be the most important words I have ever spoken.\u201d Advertisement \u201cPeople have lost the ability to judge what is true and what is not, what is reliable, what is not reliable,\u201d he says in the above video, which he posted to Facebook Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s not the country I remember growing up in. I don\u2019t remember any other time where people were standing in denial of what science was.\u201d Many scientists have become frustrated with the Trump administration\u2019s anti-science moves, which has led to them holding the Earth Day March for Science protest Saturday. Tyson, the host of the \u201c StarTalk \u201d podcast and TV show and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, has been campaigning to \u201c Make America Smart Again \u201d since President Donald Trump won the election last year. Just last month, he warned that the U.S. would need more than an intelligence boost if Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts to key areas including science passed. Advertisement \u201cRecognize what science is, and allow to be what it can and should be: In the service of civilization.\u201d Now, in his new video that\u2019s interspersed with news reports, he warns of the threats that climate change skeptics and those against vaccinations pose. One of the clips is of Vice President Mike Pence when he was a congressman enthusiastically rejecting the existence of evolution. \u201cLet us demand that educators around America teach evolution not as fact, but as theory,\u201d Pence says. Tyson praises science as an \u201cexercise in finding what is true\u201d that\u2019s based on peer-reviewed experimentation backed by other experiments and counter-experiments that gives birth to an \u201cemergent truth.\u201d He points out that science is \u201cnot something to toy with.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018I chose not to believe in E=mc2 ,\u2019\u201d he says, referring to physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s corroborated theory of special relativity. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that option. It is true, whether or not you believe in it.\u201d \u201cThe sooner you understand that, the faster we can get on with the political conversations about how to solve the problems that face us,\u201d he adds. Advertisement And Tyson warns that every minute someone is in denial of a scientific truth delays the \u201cpolitical solution that should have been established years ago.\u201d \u201cRecognize what science is, and allow to be what it can and should be: In the service of civilization,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s in our hands.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Volcanic Ash And Ancient Poop Reveal Penguins' Tragic History Eruptions might be responsible for shrinking penguin populations.

LEAVE A COMMENT By Kendra Pierre-Louis Gentoo penguin and chick in Potter Cove, King George Island. Patrick Monien It should be said that Stephen Roberts, a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey, and his colleagues from several European universities \u2014 Germany\u2019s Bremen University, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and Cardiff University, among others \u2014 did not set out to solve a mystery. Or at least, not one about the largest colonies of Gentoo penguins in Antarctica. But a new study released today in the journal Nature Communications suggests that they stumbled upon a real caper. Roberts and company went to Antarctica to collect lake bed sediments , which give us regional insights into the historical impacts of climate change . Advertisement Gentoo penguins excreting guano onto the snow near in Potter Cove, King George Island. It's relevant, we swear. Stephen Roberts \u201cWe know the broader scale picture of past climate change , say the last 10 or 12,000 years on a global basis, based on a lot of the ice core records ,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cBut a lot of the impacts that might happen in certain places are kind of regional changes. Because we have a lot more lakes than ice sheets in a lot of areas, we\u2019re able to reconstruct the temperatures from a lot more places with techniques such as this.\u201d While analyzing lake sediments from Antarctica\u2019s Ardley Island, they stumbled upon an unexpected bounty: penguin bones. \u201cThe original purpose of the study wasn\u2019t to go there to find the history of the penguin colony on Ardley Island, it was for relative sea level change,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cBut having found the bones and having found some very disparate patterns of geochemistry in the core sample, we thought it\u2019d be an interesting thing to investigate a bit further.\u201d Advertisement cientists had known for a while that Gentoo penguins, which have lived on Ardley Island for 6,700 years, have periodically experienced sharp population declines. Gentoo penguins, which currently number around 5,000 pairs on Ardley Island, are identifiable from other penguins by a white patch on their black feathers that begins behind their eye and wraps around, connecting behind the crown. Similarly, while other Antarctic penguins like the Ad\u00e9lie spend much of their time on frozen pieces of Antarctic sea ice, the Gentoo penguins\u2014which are the northernmost Antarctic penguins\u2014spend much of their time on dry land. Historical records show that the Gentoo population has declined precipitously five times over the past 6,700 years. But not all of the declines were correlated with climate changes and broader environmental effects. The lake sediment provided a much-needed clue. Roughly 62 miles southeast of Ardley Island lies the ominously-named Deception Island \u2014 so called because from the outside it looks like a normal island, but slip through a passageway into its interior and you\u2019ll discover that it\u2019s actually a ring. The inner waterway is in fact the flooded caldera of a large, active volcano . Advertisement The researcher\u2019s geochemical analyses of the lake sediment sample, which included a new kind of biological marking technique to reconstruct the changes through time \u2014 and which looked at the varying concentration of guano or penguin poop and volcanic ash \u2014 helped uncover a tragic truth: each time Deception Island\u2019s volcano had a sizable eruption, the resulting fallout was enough to almost completely wipe out Ardley Island\u2019s penguin population. The location of Ardley Island and Deception Island in Antarctica. Stephen Roberts Oblique aerial view of Ardley Island taken during helicopter uplift from Fildes Peninsula. Raised beaches can be seen in the foreground, with Ardley Lake located in the top-centre of the photograph. Stephen Roberts Advertisement \u201cThis study reveals the severe impact volcanic eruptions can have on penguins, and just how difficult it can be for a colony to fully recover,\u201d Claire Waluda, a penguin ecologist for the British Antarctic Survey, said in a statement. \u201cAn eruption can bury penguin chicks in abrasive and toxic ash, and whilst the adults can swim away, the chicks may be too young to survive in the freezing waters. Suitable nesting sites can also be buried, and may remain uninhabitable for hundreds of years.\u201d Gentoo penguins climbing slopes to the nesting colony on Ardley Island.

Exactly how the ash disrupts their population, what happens to the penguins, and why it takes between 400 and 800 years for their numbers to rebound are subjects for future research. But the study is a sobering reminder of how seemingly distant events can have catastrophic effects that linger for centuries. And this unfortunate past might not stay buried: the penguin populations wiped out by historical eruptions were about the same size as the one that exists today, and the volcano is still active .

Honda's Gravity Modification Research For us Americans, it is unthinkable for General Motors to investigate gravity modification, and here was Honda in the 1990s, at that, researching this topic. By Benjamin T. Solomon, Contributor Member, Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion Technical Committee, American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics; founder, Xodus One Foundation Member, Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion Technical Committee, American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics; founder, Xodus One Foundation Jun 8, 2015, 04:57 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. Gravity modification , the scientific term for antigravity , is the ability to modify the gravitational field without the use of mass. Thus legacy physics , the RSQ (Relativity, String & Quantum) theories, cannot deliver either the physics or technology as these require mass as their field origin. Ron Kita who recently received the first US patent (8901943) related to gravity modification, in recent history, introduced me to Dr. Takaaki Musha some years ago. Dr. Musha has a distinguished history researching Biefeld-Brown in Japan, going back to the late 1980s, and worked for the Ministry of Defense and Honda R&D. Dr. Musha is currently editing New Frontiers in Space Propulsion (Nova Publishers) expected later this year. He is one of the founders of the International Society for Space Science whose aim is to develop new propulsion systems for interstellar travel. Advertisement Wait. What? Honda? Yes. For us Americans, it is unthinkable for General Motors to investigate gravity modification, and here was Honda in the 1990s, at that, researching this topic. In recent years Biefeld-Brown has gained some notoriety as an ionic wind effect. I, too, was of this opinion until I read Dr. Musha's 2008 paper \" Explanation of Dynamical Biefeld-Brown Effect from the Standpoint of ZPF field. \" Reading this paper I realized how thorough, detailed and meticulous Dr. Musha was. Quoting selected portions from Dr. Musha's paper: In 1956, T.T. Brown presented a discovery known as the Biefeld-Bown effect (abbreviated B-B effect) that a sufficiently charged capacitor with dielectrics exhibited unidirectional thrust in the direction of the positive plate. From the 1st of February until the 1st of March in 1996, the research group of the HONDA R&D Institute conducted experiments to verify the B-B effect with an improved experimental device which rejected the influence of corona discharges and electric wind around the capacitor by setting the capacitor in the insulator oil contained within a metallic vessel . . . The experimental results measured by the Honda research group are shown . . . V. Putz and K. Svozil, . . . predicted that the electron experiences an increase in its rest mass under an intense electromagnetic field . . . and the equivalent . . . formula with respect to the mass shift of the electron under intense electromagnetic field was discovered by P. Milonni . . . Dr. Musha concludes his paper with, . . . The theoretical analysis result suggests that the impulsive electric field applied to the dielectric material may produce a sufficient artificial gravity to attain velocities comparable to chemical rockets. Given, Honda R&D's experimental research findings, this is a major step forward for the Biefeld-Brown effect, and Biefeld-Brown is back on the table as a potential propulsion technology. We learn two lesson. First, that any theoretical analysis of an experimental result is advanced or handicapped by the contemporary physics. While the experimental results remain valid, at the time of the publication, zero point fluctuation (ZPF) was the appropriate theory. However, per Prof. Robert Nemiroff's 2012 stunning discovery that quantum foam and thus ZPF does not exist, the theoretical explanation for the Biefeld-Brown effect needs to be reinvestigated in light of Putz, Svozil and Milonni's research findings. This is not an easy task as that part of the foundational legacy physics is now void. Advertisement Second, it took decades of Dr. Musha's own research to correctly advise Honda R&D how to conduct with great care and attention to detail, this type of experimental research. I would advise anyone serious considering Biefeld-Brown experiments to talk to Dr. Musha, first. Another example of similar lessons relates to the Finnish/Russian Dr. Podkletnov's gravity shielding spinning superconducting ceramic disc i.e. an object placed above this spinning disc would lose weight. I spent years reading and rereading Dr. Podkletnov's two papers (the 1992 \" A Possibility of Gravitational Force Shielding by Bulk YBa2Cu3O7-x Superconductor \" and the 1997 \" Weak gravitational shielding properties of composite bulk YBa2Cu3O7-x superconductor below 70K under e.m. field \") before I fully understood all the salient observations. Advertisement Any theory on Dr. Podkletnov's experiments must explain four observations , the stationary disc weight loss, spinning disc weight loss, weight loss increase along a radial distance and weight increase. Other than my own work I haven't see anyone else attempt to explain all four observation within the context of the same theoretical analysis . The most likely inference is that legacy physics does not have the tools to explore Podkletnov's experiments. But it gets worse. Interest in Dr. Podkletnov's work was destroyed by two papers claiming null results. First, Woods et al, (the 2001 \" Gravity Modification by High-Temperature Superconductors \") and second, Hathaway et al (the 2002 \" Gravity Modification Experiments Using a Rotating Superconducting Disk and Radio Frequency Fields \"). Reading through these papers it was very clear to me that neither team were able to faithfully reproduce Dr. Podkletnov's work. My analysis of Dr. Podkletnov's papers show that the disc is electrified and bi-layered. By bi-layered, the top side is superconducting and the bottom non-superconducting. Therefore, to get gravity modifying effects, the key to experimental success is, bottom side needs to be much thicker than the top . Without getting into too much detail, this would introduce asymmetrical field structures, and gravity modifying effects. Advertisement The necessary dialog between theoretical explanations and experimental insight is vital to any scientific study. Without this dialog , there arises confounding obstructions; theoretically impossible but experiments work or theoretically possible but experiments don't work . With respect to Biefeld-Brown, Dr. Musha has completed the first iteration of this dialog. Above all, we cannot be sure what we have discovered is correct until we have tested these discoveries under different circumstances. This is especially true for future propulsion technologies where we cannot depend on legacy physics for guidance, and essentially don't understand what we are looking for. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Rosetta Spacecraft Crash Lands On Comet, Bringing Historical Mission To An End \"We will end in a very rock-and-roll fashion.\" Victoria Bryan Sep 30, 2016, 01:51 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING BERLIN, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Rosetta spacecraft ended its historic mission on Friday, crashing on the surface of the dusty, icy comet it has spent 12 years chasing in a hunt that has provided insight into the early days of the solar system and captured the public\u2019s imagination. The spacecraft has stalked comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko across more than 6 billion km (3.7 billion miles) of space, collecting a treasure trove of information on comets that will keep scientists busy for the next decade. Advertisement Scientists in the European Space Agency control center in Darmstadt, Germany, clapped and hugged as confirmation of the end of the mission came at 1119 GMT. Rosetta completed its free-fall descent at the speed of a sedate walk, joining the probe Philae, which landed on the comet in November 2014 in what was considered a remarkable feat of precision space travel. \u201cThank you Rosetta ,\u201d ESA director general Jan Woerner said on Twitter. He was among some 300 people who had also gathered before dawn at a conference room at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, to watch a live webcast as Rosetta \u2019s signal disappeared from monitors, simultaneously with the team in Germany. Advertisement \u201cIt was a good ending,\u201d Klaus Schiling, who worked on mission planning for Rosetta 27 years ago with prime contractor Airbus , told Reuters at the Mexico space conference. \u201cThere were so many ups and downs with this mission.\u201d A comet, 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko, being studied by Europe's orbiting Rosetta spacecraft is shown in this handout photo taken August 22, 2014 and provided by the European Space Agency on September 28, 2015. Handout . / Reuters PLANET FORMATION The mission managed several historic firsts, such as getting a spacecraft into orbit around a comet and the unprecedented landing of a probe on the surface. A handful of previous spacecraft had snapped pictures and collected data as they flew past their targets. Advertisement But, dashing hopes for more discoveries, Philae, the 100 kg (220 lb) probe, bounced several times on landing before getting stuck against a cliff wall, leaving it unable to perform any more experiments beyond its first three days on the comet after its solar-powered batteries ran out. Rosetta \u2019s cameras located Philae\u2019s resting place just a few weeks ago. The ESA is ending the mission because 67P is racing toward the outer solar system, out of range for the solar-powered spacecraft. Rosetta also has been subjected to the harsh radiation and extreme temperatures of space since launching in March 2004 and so was unlikely to last too much longer. Advertisement Before reaching the surface and shutting down, Rosetta \u2019s instruments and camera relayed back data and images, giving scientists insight into the structure of the comet. That data will reveal information on the side walls of the comet, crucial to understanding how they are formed, plus on large 100-meter (300 foot) wide pits, which scientists believe are key to how the comet releases gas and dust as it is warmed by the sun. Daniel Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said the images sent back from the Rosetta mission were \u201cas powerful as Neil Armstrong\u2019s first steps on the Moon.\u201d Advertisement Data collected by Rosetta and Philae is already helping scientists better understand how the Earth and other planets formed. For example, scientists now believe that asteroids, not comets were primarily responsible for delivering water to Earth and other planets in the inner solar system, possibly setting the stage for life. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Should You Eat Your Own Placenta? Scientists Find No Risks, But No Benefits Either Wait, What's The Benefit Of Eating Your Own Placenta? By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 7, 2015, 11:16 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT the finished product! Sure, actress January Jones , reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian , and many other celebrities have done it and loved it . But a new scientific paper on placentophagy finds no health benefits for women who chow down on their own afterbirth (or pop placenta pills). Advertisement \u201cThere are a lot of subjective reports from women who perceived benefits, but there hasn\u2019t been any systematic research investigating the benefits or the risk of placenta ingestion ,\u201d Dr. Crystal Clark, an assistant professor in psychology and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University and co-author of the paper, said in a written statement. \u201cThe studies on mice aren\u2019t translatable into human benefits.\" For the review, the researchers analyzed 10 studies on placentophagy published between January 1950 and January 2014, all of which looked at purported health benefits like protecting against postpartum depression or reducing post-delivery pain. The researchers found no evidence of such benefits -- nor any clear indication of risks. \"While previous research has identified some important areas to direct future studies, the data supporting the benefits of placentophagy for human mothers is limited to anecdotal and self-reported evidence,\" Sharon Young, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has studied placentophagy but was not involved in the new paper, told The Huffington Post in an email, \"and the empirical data come from animal studies and less rigorous human studies from the early to mid-1900's.\" Advertisement (Story continues below.) A close look at the placenta. Though the research didn't turn up any obvious risks to placentophagy, the placenta -- the organ that's attached to the lining of a mother's womb during pregnancy -- is known to keep potential pathogens from reaching the fetus. That suggests the need for additional research. \"Bacteria and elements such as mercury and lead have been identified in the post-term placenta ,\" Clark told CBS News. \"So if the theory is that we retain nutrients and hormones such as estrogen and iron that could be beneficial, then the question becomes what harmful substances can also be retained that could harm the mother or the baby if she is breastfeeding.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Scientists Create 3D Fly-Through Map Of Space Dust In Our Galaxy Like a galactic GPS, better dust maps will help astronomers peer more clearly into deep space. By Lee Speigel Writer, Editor, HuffPost Mar 26, 2017, 02:20 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT This image is from an animation sequence that shows a 3D rendering of space dust, as viewed in a several-kiloparsec (thousands of light-years) loop through and out of the Milky Way\u2019s galactic plane. Gregory M Green/SLAC KIPAC Astronomers hate dust as much as the rest of us \u2015 even more, perhaps. It\u2019s one thing to get a little dust in your eye that takes your vision out of focus. Now imagine this kind of dust problem on a galactic scale where it hinders scientists trying to focus their telescopes into space. That\u2019s part of the challenge faced by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, reports Space.com . They\u2019re creating an instrument that will offer specific information on how fast the universe is growing. Advertisement This device \u2015 the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument \u2015 will create a map of over 30 million galaxies. But in order for that map to be precise, astronomers will have to correct for the problems created by all the dust particles in the Milky Way galaxy that impede their deep space investigations. \u201cBecause outer space is a very dusty place, that makes things very difficult for astronomers and astrophysicists who are trying to peer farther across the universe or deep into the center of our own galaxy to learn more about their structure, formation and evolution,\u201d according to a Berkeley Lab statement . To help with the DESI project, Berkeley researchers created the following detailed 3D animation showing dust that spans thousands of light-years in our home galaxy. The study was published this week in The Astrophysical Journal . Here\u2019s the animation: Advertisement \u201cThe light from those distant galaxies travels for billions of years before we see it,\u201d said Edward F. Schlafly in the Berkeley Lab statement. \u201cBut in the last thousand years of its journey toward us, a few percent of that light is absorbed and scattered by dust in our own galaxy. We need to correct for that.\u201d 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Schlafly and his team created the 3D map (seen above) fly-through of the Milky Way by using data composed of separate sky surveys from telescopes on Maui and in New Mexico, resulting in 3D dust maps \u201cmany times better than anything that previously existed,\u201d Schlafly said. Advertisement The Berkeley scientists are looking to create higher quality dust maps which will, in turn, provide them with improved details about space dust properties. \u201cThis can give us a much more precise gauge of distances to faraway stars in the Milky Way, like a galactic GPS,\u201d they said.

Here's Why Einstein's Theory Of Relativity Is Absolutely 'Perfect' (PODCAST) Here's Why Einstein's Theory Of Relativity Is Perfect By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Feb 18, 2015, 10:21 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A century has passed since Albert Einstein published his seminal paper on general relativity, and scientists are still using this iconic theory to explain the world. To Dr. Pedro G. Ferreira, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford in England and the author of a new book about relativity, that's not at all surprising. He considers Einstein's theory of general relativity a \"perfect\" one. Advertisement \"The theory that he comes up with in 1915, a hundred years ago, is still the theory we work with,\" Ferreira (right) said in a recent interview with HuffPost's senior science editor, David Freeman. \"It\u2019s exactly the theory we work with. There are no modifications... It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s very elegant\u2014just a simple formula. Yet a hundred years later we\u2019re still trying to figure out what this formula tells us.\" Perfect, maybe. But relativity is perplexing for those of us who lack sophisticated mathematical skills. Fortunately, Ferreria, whose book is entitled \"The Perfect Theory,\" is well equipped to explain things--from the thought experiments that fueled Einstein's imagination to the astronomy experiment that proved his theory correct to how scientists since Einstein have put the theory to work.

Nobel Prize Winner Trashes Brexit As Bad For Science Fraser Stoddart fears that research will suffer if Britain becomes more closed off to Europeans. By Willa Frej Reporter, HuffPost Oct 5, 2016, 11:47 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING The United Kingdom leaving the European Union would spell bad news for the global science community, according to a winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry . Sir Fraser Stoddart, a Scottish chemist who teaches at Northwestern University, attributes his Nobel win to international collaboration between scientists. Advertisement \u201c Science is global ,\u201d he told BBC World Service NewsHour on Wednesday. \u201cI am sitting here with this prize associated with my name but it really is pinned onto the names of another 20, 30, 40 different nationalities.\u201d Stoddart shares the 2016 prize with Jean-Pierre Sauvage of France and Bernard Feringa of the Netherlands. Together, they discovered tiny molecular machines . He said his early career was defined by the U.K. welcoming young scientists from across Europe. \u201cToday, I am distressed by the fact that the U.K. is looking at a situation that [would] cut off that supply,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not good news for scientists in the U.K. I would hope that this whole business of Brexit would either go away or just did not happen.\u201d Advertisement Brits voted in June to leave the EU. Brexit critics, however, fear future social consequences, which may include tougher immigration policies. \u201cI would not be surprised if you see the most able scientists in the country leave,\u201d Stoddart said. \u201cScience is a global pursuit, it must allow people to come and go across different cultures from different countries.\u201d Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Bill Nye Is 'Open-Minded But Skeptical' About Elon Musk's Bold New Vision For Mars Pros: Mars is exotic, romantic. Cons: It's cold, barren and can't even breathe. By David Freeman Managing Editor of Impact & Innovation, The Huffington Post Sep 28, 2016, 10:12 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Bill Nye, above, said he's \"open-minded but skeptical\" about Elon Musk's plan to colonize Mars. Noam Galai/Getty Images Bill Nye likes Mars as much as the next guy \u2015 more, probably, since the Science Guy also heads up The Planetary Society, a Pasadena, California-based nonprofit that pushes exploration of the solar system. But Nye isn\u2019t totally sold on SpaceX CEO Elon Musk\u2019s bold new plan to colonize Mars . Under the plan, which Musk detailed Tuesday at a major astronautics conference in Guadalajara, Mexico, SpaceX will build a fleet of vast spaceships and use them to ferry wave upon wave of humans to the red planet. The company aims to send the first humans to Mars in 2025. Advertisement \u201cI\u2019m open-minded but skeptical that anyone actually wants to live out his or her life on Mars any more than anyone wants to colonize Antarctica,\u201d Nye told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cMars is an exotic place and in some ways very romantic. But it\u2019s cold, barren and you can\u2019t even breathe.\u201d And the cost for getting to Mars will be astronomical. Musk anticipates charging folks about $200,000 apiece for a trip to the red planet \u2015 and that\u2019s after the price comes down. Advertisement Musk has long considered the colonization of other planets a life-or-death imperative, given the existential threats to life on Earth posed by runaway climate change, killer asteroids and the like. \u201cUltimately, the thing that is super-important in the grand scale of history is, are we on a path to becoming a multi-planet species or not?\u201d Musk said in 2011 (and has been saying ever since). \u201cIf we\u2019re not, that\u2019s not a very bright future. We\u2019ll just be hanging out on Earth until some eventual calamity claims us.\u201d Nye, who was on hand in Guadalajara for Musk\u2019s well-attended presentation, is known for climate activism as well as for his enthusiasm for space exploration. Advertisement But establishing a Mars colony clearly isn\u2019t his first priority. \u201cI very much hope we conduct a thorough, careful search for life on Mars before we consider landing dozens of tons of people and cargo,\u201d he told HuffPost. That search is already underway, of course. For decades now, NASA has been sending landers and rovers to Mars \u2015 and the space agency has its own plan to send astronauts there sometime in the 2030s . By then, Musk\u2019s colonists might have been living on Mars for years. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This Is What The Holiday Season Does To Your Brain Giving, gratitude and all that sugar can make you feel awesome. But the winter blues are real, too. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Dec 24, 2015, 07:01 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Mike Kemp via Getty Images It turns out that there's a whole network in our brains devoted to the Christmas spirit. Scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark accidentally found evidence of the network when they were conducting migraine research and noticed that several regions of the brain activate when healthy people view warm and fuzzy Christmas-themed photos. They published their finding in the British Medical Journal on Dec. 16. \"We found the findings very interesting,\" Dr. Bryan Haddock, a medical physicist at the university and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post. Advertisement The network includes the occipital lobe, which is associated with vision; the primary and premotor cortex, associated with movement; and the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, associated with the sense of touch. The findings may offer a scientific explanation as to why some people have an Ebenezer Scrooge-like tendency to lack holiday cheer, said Haddock, who has his own family traditions of dancing around the Christmas tree. He added, however, that it's important to interpret the findings with caution. \"All of these areas are involved in more complex operations that are less understood,\" he said. The scientists used fMRI technology to pinpoint where brain responses to Christmas imagery occurred , but not necessarily why or how these occurrences took place. The researchers who looked at the \" Christmas spirit network \" concluded not only that more research is needed to understand the newfound network, but also that there could be other holiday-related circuits in the brain. Advertisement After all, this network is not all that lights up between your ears when you experience Christmas cheer. Scroll down for five other fascinating ways in which your brain may respond to season's greetings. 1. Your brain on giving Yes, it feels awesome to open your gifts, but a 2006 MRI study showed that when you give charitable gifts, your brain's reward system still responds as if you received something pleasurable yourself. Specifically, the researchers found that the brain's mesolimbic reward system responded to the behavior of giving in the same way that it responded to receiving a monetary reward. In other words, giving is equally as enjoyable as receiving. 2. Your brain on gratitude During the holidays, as we spend quality time with family and friends, many of us reflect on how grateful we are for those we love. Advertisement A study published in September found that when that reflection happens, our brains may experience enhanced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex. These areas have been linked to emotional processing, social interactions and moral judgment . \"There has not been much attention given to the emotion of gratitude , and yet it is extremely important in social behavior,\" Dr. Antonio Damasio, the study's senior author and a professor of psychology and neurology at the University of Southern California, said in a statement. \"Gratitude rewards generosity and maintains the cycle of healthy social behavior.\" 3. Your brain on stress Our holidays are not only filled with love and family, but also with the stresses of shopping, traveling and baking. Advertisement In fact, a 2008 poll conducted by the American Psychological Association showed that more than 8 out of 10 Americans anticipated feeling stressed during the holidays. Among many other effects, when we experience stress , an enzyme may be triggered to attack a molecule in the hippocampus , which is associated with emotion and memory, according to a 2014 study. This may help explain why we become irritable and sometimes even forgetful when we're anxious. Bah humbug. 4. Your brain on sugar It's tough to resist sugar plums, eggnog and gingerbread cookies, but when you chow down on holiday treats, the sugary goodness can send a signal from the tongue to the brain's cerebral cortex , which activates the reward system. Sure, stimulating the brain's reward system now and then may not be problematic. But if the reward system is activated too much and too frequently, that may result in the brain having enhanced responses to and unhealthy cravings for sugar . Advertisement 5. Your brain on the winter blues If you tend to get a little blue during the holiday season, don't blame Christmas. Rather, it may be the result of seasonal affective disorder , which is a form of clinical depression that reoccurs seasonally, such as during the fall and winter months. In 2014, researchers linked the biochemical cause of seasonal depression to higher levels of the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein, which affects mood. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Naps Do Your Brain (And Body) Good How Naps Do Your Brain (And Body) Good By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Feb 13, 2015, 08:51 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Running seriously low on sleep? A nap can not only make you feel better, but can reverse the effects of poor sleep by restoring hormones and proteins involved in stress and immune health. The fact that poor sleep can increase stress levels and suppress immune system activity is well-established. But according to a new small study, napping can be an effective antidote by creating measurable hormone changes. Advertisement Researchers from the Sorbonne University in Paris found that a brief nap was effective in relieving stress and strengthening immune system function in men who had only slept two hours the night before. \"Our data suggests a 30-minute nap can reverse the hormonal impact of a night of poor sleep,\" study co-author Dr. Brice Faraut said in a statement. \"This is the first study that found napping could restore biomarkers of neuroendocrine and immune health to normal levels.\" The researchers conducted sleep tests on 11 healthy men between the ages of 25 and 32. In a laboratory setting with controlled lighting and meals, the participants took part in two sessions of sleep testing. In the first session, the men were only allowed to sleep for two hours in one night. In the second session, the men were allowed to take two 30-minute naps the day following a night that they got only two hours of sleep. On the evening prior to both sessions, the subjects got eight hours of sleep. Advertisement Then, the researchers took samples of the mens' urine and saliva to test how the lack of sleep affected their hormone levels. After the night of only two hours of sleep, the mens' levels of norepinephrine -- a stress hormone and neurotransmitter involved in the fight-or-flight response, which increases heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar -- was two and a half times higher than they were after a normal night of sleep. After a night of sleeping only two hours, the participants also exhibited a dip in interleukin-6 levels, an antiviral protein that stimulates immune response to infection or in the aftermath of trauma. However, when the men had napped twice after a night of limited sleep, the researchers found no change in norepinephrine levels. Interleukin-6 levels also returned to normal after napping. The findings suggest that napping can reverse the some of the negative health effects of poor sleep and can also promote overall well-being. Advertisement \"Napping may offer a way to counter the damaging effects of sleep restriction by helping the immune and neuroendocrine systems to recover,\" Faraut explained. \"The findings support the development of practical strategies for addressing chronically sleep-deprived populations, such as night and shift workers.\" If that wasn't reason to get a little midday shut-eye, napping has also been shown to boost mood, productivity and creativity, and to facilitate learning and memory. A 2011 study also found that those who napped for at least 45 minutes had lower blood pressure in response to psychological stress than those who did not nap. The findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (JCEM).

Brazilian Man Plays The Beatles' 'Yesterday' On His Guitar While Undergoing Brain Surgery Man Plays Beatles Song On His Guitar While Undergoing Brain Surgery By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jun 5, 2015, 05:24 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An astonishing video shows the moment a Brazilian man started playing \u201cYesterday\u201d on his guitar while undergoing brain surgery . Anthony Kulkamp Dias, 33, was having a brain tumor removed last week when he started playing the classic Beatles tune , reports The Guardian. Advertisement Kulkamp, who is said to have played guitar professionally for 20 years, also played a song entitled \u201cEmanuel,\u201d which he wrote for his newborn son, and other songs during the operation. \u201cI played six songs at certain times,\u201d Kulkamp told local media of the surgery, per The Telegraph. \u201cMy right hand was a bit weaker because that was the side that they were operating on. So I stopped and rested. I was interspersing songs and talking with them.\u201d Kulkamp was reportedly kept conscious during the surgery so as to enable doctors to safely map the brain , allowing them to avoid injuring the organ in a way that would compromise important functions later on. Advertisement Since the brain has no pain receptors, keeping patients conscious during surgery is not entirely unusual . It is unusual, however, for a patient to play music mid-operation -- though it has been done before. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

After The March For Science, It's Time To Get Political Solving the climate crisis will take activism, protest, and movement building. By Jamie Henn, Contributor Co-founder and Strategic Communications Director, 350.org and 350 Action Co-founder and Strategic Communications Director, 350.org and 350 Action Apr 21, 2017, 05:00 PM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT This weekend, tens of thousands of people are expected to take part in the March for Science in Washington, D.C. and at over 500 satellite marches all around the world. Where I live, up in deeply nerdy Cambridge, Massachusetts, there are March for Science posters up all across the city. My Facebook feed is full of friends debating what geeky message they should put on their signs for the march tomorrow. The debates about the March for Science go beyond what math equation looks best on a placard, however. The March has been critiqued as too elitist , too white , and unwilling to own up to the ways science has been misused as a tool of white supremacy throughout history. (To their credit, I think, March organizers have engaged in these discussions from the start and made strides in addressing a number of concerns, although there is certainly much more work to be done). Advertisement The debate that\u2019s been most interesting for me is whether or not the March for Science is \u201cpolitical.\u201d Some groups, including many of the large science associations involved in the march, have spoken of the effort as non-political. Science, they argue, is something that exists outside of politics and needs to stay there, rather than getting dragged through the mud of our political process. Others have said that the March for Science is political, but non-partisan. They want politicians of all-stripes to support science, research, and scientific literacy. Still others have said, no, this march is inherently partisan and anti-Trump. It\u2019s the Republican party, they argue, that has made science political by joining with industry front groups to spread doubt and denial, and it\u2019s Donald Trump \u2019s censorship of government employees, his climate denial, and his proposed cuts to science programs at places like NASA which prompted the march. So, which is it? Over the last decade as a climate activist, I\u2019ve had the privilege of working with lots of scientists in all of the capacities above. We\u2019ve used their research to inform our work, going so far as to name our organization after what scientists say is the safe upper limit of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, 350 parts per million (we\u2019re now well over 400ppm). We\u2019ve also gotten arrested with them, helping coordinate protests like the first sit-ins against the Keystone XL pipeline in 2011, which former NASA climate scientist Dr. James Hansen and other scientists took part in. Advertisement In my experience, the scientists we work with are always reluctant to get engaged in politics, but get dragged into it when they see politicians actively distorting their findings, lying about their reports, or making policy decisions that run so contrary to what science tells us is necessary. They feel forced to act. Scientists get involved to help set the record straight, offer their expertise, and fight for the truth, when necessary. It\u2019s not scientists who make science political, it\u2019s politicians. A good example is in the #ExxonKnew campaign, an effort to hold ExxonMobil accountable for their decades of funding climate denial and misinformation. Back in the late 1970s, Exxon scientists warned their higher-ups at the company about the threat of global warming. Instead of warning the public, executives, including our new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, buried the truth and spent millions to spread misinformation about the issue. It was a page straight out of the Big Tobacco playbook and it cost us decades in responding to the crisis. Far from repenting for their sins, the fossil fuel industry continues to spend millions every year on climate denial front groups, and millions more lobbying against renewable energy, environmental protections, or science based policy of any sort. All that spending has bought Big Oil plenty of friends on Capitol Hill. One of their favorite puppets has been Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, a climate denier who chairs none other than the House Committee for Science, Space and Technology. Smith is notorious for subpoenaing government science organizations like NOAA because of their work on climate change. (He\u2019s also subpoenaed my organization, 350.org , for our work on the #ExxonKnew campaign). Earlier this year, Smith dragged out a cast of climate deniers to present to his committee. House Democrats were able to invite only one witness, Dr. Michael Mann, who did his best to set the record straight. The Scopes Monkey Trial-like hearing made headlines across the country. Advertisement The ExxonKnew case, and the political theater surrounding it, has helped convince more scientists to speak out, especially about the lies and misinformation they see being spread by the fossil fuel industry and their allies in Washington. Scientists like Dr. Mann, and scientific scholars like Harvard\u2019s Naomi Oreskes, have become influential voices pushing back on attacks on their field. More scientists are taking to the streets, as well. At this year\u2019s American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, a \u201cScience Stands\u201d rally drew hundreds of participants. A few weeks later, thousands of scientists and researchers took to the streets in Boston for a similar demonstration. It\u2019s important and powerful to see more scientists getting involved in politics. We need their voices, speaking accurately and clearly about the challenges we face as a society, from public health to climate change. And we could use far more scientists in public office (it would be nice to have an actual scientist chair the House Science Committee, for example, rather than oily Lamar Smith). Advertisement But it shouldn\u2019t really be up to scientists to be the ones marching in the streets. Their participation in the March for Science is fantastic, but we need our brilliant glaciologists and solar engineers to spend the majority of their time on their research, not on campaign strategy and organizing. We\u2019re counting on them to be our warning system about what\u2019s happening to our planet; the engineers that can help invent new, renewable energy technologies that will help solve this crisis. Activism is the work of the rest of us. Each and everyone of us, no matter our background, can be involved in the political fight for climate action. That\u2019s why you see so many different organizations, over 900 at the last count, coming together the weekend after the March for Science for the Peoples Climate March, a mobilization for climate, jobs and justice. From the social justice organizations like the NAACP, to international labor unions, to the nation\u2019s largest environmental groups, movements are coming together to fight for a common cause. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Advertisement In this way, the Peoples Climate March is the next step beyond the March for Science, a call to get more engaged in our political system, to confront power, and to demand solutions. It is a march that treats climate change as not only a scientific issue, but as a matter of social, economic, gender, and racial justice. The demands that we will put forward \u2014 respect for Indigenous peoples, investments in communities on the front lines of the climate crisis, moving away from fossil fuels towards 100% clean energy, and more \u2014 highlight the intersections between all of our different struggles, as well as the common solutions that we can work for together. Solving the climate crisis, and addressing the underlying racial and social inequities that helped cause it in the first place, will take more than good science. It\u2019s going to take activism, protest, and movement building. That\u2019s why we need you out at the Peoples Climate March on April 29th. The breakthroughs required to address the climate crisis aren\u2019t just in the laboratory, they\u2019re in our political system. Getting those breakthroughs is up to us. Let\u2019s march .

Actual Scientists Found That Ayahuasca Can Help You Think More Creatively A psychedelic trip could give your mind the flexibility to unlock old thought patterns. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Sep 28, 2016, 03:33 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic brew from the Amazon consumed in religious ceremonies for centuries, has been gaining popularity in Europe and North America as a mind-altering trick to condense years of psychotherapy into a psychedelic trip just a few hours long. Drinking the plant brew, users report, helps gain psychological insight and produce new ideas, among other things. To those users, it\u2019s not exactly news that a psychedelic can enhance creativity . But in recent years, science has been catching up to oral literature, trying to use more objective methods to double-check people\u2019s anecdotes about the effects of the muddy, foul-tasting brew. In one study published in Psychopharmacology in July , researchers in Spain and the Netherlands report that ayahuasca seems to help people apply more creative and \u201cdivergent\u201d thinking to solving puzzles. Normally in our attempt to solve problems, we employ convergent thinking, in which we narrow down potential solutions to find the correct answer we\u2019re looking for. Sometimes, however, that correct answer just happens to fall somewhere outside the box, requiring a more open-minded, or divergent, thinking style to find it. Advertisement That\u2019s why the mental flexibility people on ayahuasca had when they approached their puzzles may prove useful in psychotherapy: It might help patients break out of habitual and problematic thought patterns. \u201cWe think if you have depression and are stuck in negative thinking patterns, for example, it might be good to be able to think a bit more flexibly and come up with new or positive ideas, which you then can use to improve the quality of your life,\u201d study co-author Kim Kuypers, an assistant professor at the department of psychology and neuroscience at Maastricht University in The Netherlands, told The Huffington Post. The possibility that ayahuasca and other psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin mushrooms could help in the treatment of mental illnesses has helped revive a new wave of research into the drugs, which were rendered illegal in the 1970s. But how these drugs affect the brain remains unclear. The handful of studies that have started to look into this question suggest they work by altering the patterns of communication among several brain networks, thus opening new ways of thinking and perception. Advertisement Kuypers, who has studied both the negative effects and potential medical uses of the drug MDMA, was approached by Jordi Riba , a researcher at Sant Pau hospital in Barcelona and a longtime researcher of ayahuasca. Riba was interested in a creativity test that Kuypers and her colleagues had previously set up and wanted to have ayahuasca users take a stab at it. The team visited two spiritual ayahuasca-using groups and invited members to enter the study. Twenty-six healthy people participated in the study. They were experienced in taking the brew; many of them had taken it dozens of times. Their interest in psychoactive drugs, they told researchers, stemmed from a desire for personal experimentation and enhancing introspection, self-knowledge and personal growth. One of the tests used in the study was the \u201cpicture concept test,\u201d which has been traditionally used as part of intelligence tests in children. In its simplest form, the test involves four pictures in two rows, and the test taker has to find an association between one of the pictures in each row. The number of pictures can go up to 16, divided in four rows, making the test more sophisticated. Advertisement Here\u2019s an example of what a simple form of the picture-concept test might look like: Getty The participants took the test once before and once during the ayahuasca trip (interestingly, the people reported liking the test, saying the colorful images spurred their imagination). When on ayahuasca, they actually became worse at pointing out the correct solutions, suggesting their convergent thinking was impaired. But instead, they offered many alternative and original solutions, finding associations that weren\u2019t readily visible, pointing to a more divergent way of thinking. Advertisement For example, the correct answer above would be to pick the sun and the moon \u2014 both belong to the category of celestial objects. But you could also pick the mushroom and unicorn, arguing that being on shrooms could make you see unicorns. There are many such out-of-the-box reasonings possible, and you can imagine how things can escalate quickly once the number of pictures goes from four to 16. It\u2019s not clear whether the alternative solutions that people came up with were always actually good ideas \u2014 we still don\u2019t know if taking ayahuasca can give you the idea for your next book or startup. But it was the flexible way of thinking and tackling a problem that was the most interesting and potentially useful, Kuypers said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How long this spike in divergent thinking and creativity lasts is another question, Kuypers said. Future studies should test people a day later or so to examine the long-term effects, she said. Advertisement \u201cIt would interesting to see if they were still different in divergent and convergent thinking after their trip,\u201d Kuypers said. \u201cIt would be useful to see the long-term effects of the drink, especially if you want to use it in psychotherapy.\u201d Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

The Surprising Origins Of 'Let The Cat Out Of The Bag' And Three Other Common Expressions Here's Where That 'Let The Cat Out Of The Bag' Expression Came From By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jun 4, 2015, 03:42 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Ever wonder where certain expressions came from? A new video (above) \"lets the cat out of the bag\" about that expression and three others that are as strange as they are familiar. \"If you were alive in the Middle Ages and wanted to buy a pig at a market, that pig would be put in a bag and given to you to take home,\" narrator Pat Graziosi explains in the video, part of the online series Life Noggin . \"But don't be too trusting.

UNC Isn't Charlie Hebdo, and Thomas Paine Isn't Osama Bin Laden The tragic shooting of three young university students at UNC Chapel Hill yesterday could have been adopted by the media as yet another indictment of the rampant gun culture in the United States. By Lawrence M. Krauss, Contributor Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University; Author, 'A Universe From Nothing' Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University; Author, 'A Universe From Nothing' Feb 13, 2015, 07:44 PM EST This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform. Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. The tragic shooting of three young university students at UNC Chapel Hill yesterday could have been adopted by the media as yet another indictment of the rampant gun culture in the United States. After all, the alleged killer had previously posted a photograph of his .38-caliber revolver on this Facebook page, and apparently had been harassing the young family in question for some time while wearing a gun on his belt. Instead however, much more attention has been paid to the fact that on the same Facebook page, Stephen Hicks had expressed support for atheism and the three victims were all Muslims. It is perhaps natural, in spite of the fact that all evidence currently points to a much more mundane cause of the shootings -- disputes over parking spaces -- for many in Muslim communities around the world, particularly sensitive to back reactions to the terrorist shootings in Paris, to jump to the conclusion that this was a hate crime. What is more surprising is the connection being suggested, even in various relatively liberal papers and magazines including the Washington Post and the New Republic, between atheism's most vocal advocates and this violence. It may be impossible to ever know what was going through the mind of Mr. Hicks when he committed his crime, although he never appeared in advance to advocate violence against any religious group. But either way, to compare the crime in North Carolina with the crimes against Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists and others in Paris under the general rubric of \"hate crime\" is to seriously misrepresent both heinous events. Advertisement Let's be clear about one thing. Hate speech is directed at people, not ideas. To argue that individuals like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, or any of the other outspoken atheists, including myself, who criticize the doctrines of Islam, or Christianity, are inciting violence against individuals on the scale of the terrorists who espouse Islamic fundamentalism is akin to suggesting that the Enlightenment was fundamentally no different than the theocracies it eventually undermined. Consider the words of one writer in the New Republic when labeling Hicks as a potential hate criminal, saying he \"expressed his admiration for Richard Dawkins's The God Delusion and Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason , and condemned \"radical\" Christianity and Islam alike for their alleged ideological similarities,\" as if somehow praising reason over ideology is the first step toward violent action. As Dawkins himself said when he appeared with at the Rally for Reason, held in the Mall in Washington DC several years ago: \"I don't despise religious people, I despise what they stand for.\" Or as another vocal atheist Ricky Gervais said, perhaps more gently, in our film The Unbelievers, which captured Dawkins' remarks as well: \"Everyone has a right to believe anything. But I have the right to find that belief ridiculous.\" It is true that Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and the late Christopher Hitchens, several of the more well-known atheist authors, have spoken out strongly and explicitly against violent Islamic fundamentalism. There is a reason for this. In the current world, amongst all religions, it is Islamic fundamentalism that appears to explicitly incite more violent actions than other forms of fundamentalism. Fundamentalist Christians can also commit random acts of violence, including, for example, advocating violence against abortion clinics or abortion doctors, but these do not approach the scale of ISIS or Boko Haram. To argue that somehow Dawkins or the others promote Islamophobia by simply stating this fact about extremism is misrepresent their writing. Most importantly, it is the ideas these terrorists espouse that most effectively incite the literary wrath of these gentlemen. Advertisement One merely has to explore the ridicule they have streamed against the viler aspects of Judaism and Christianity in order to understand that they find Islam intrinsically no more ridiculous than these other creeds. They merely point out, correctly, that in the current world, Islamic fundamentalism breeds more violence. As they, and I, and others, have pointed out, the fundamental difference between fundamentalist Islam, as it is espoused today, and fundamentalist Judaism or Christianity, is that while the Old Testament in particular endorses violence at least as much if not more than the Qur'an, modern literalists attached to the former have largely renounced such maxims as the recommendation to kill disobedient children, or apostates. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It was not always the case of course, and the history of Judeo-Christianity involves potentially far greater rivers of blood, torture and hate. But most of this occurred in the distant past. As recently as 500 years ago, Christians were burning thousands of women at the stake, and inflicting the most hideous tortures on unbelievers. Perhaps it is not surprising that a religion that began 500 years later is now experiencing similar violence. The difference of course is that in the current world, with instant communication and ready transport, not only can terrorism have a global impact, but with access to modern weapons, the violence its adherents promote may also be more widespread and potentially more devastating. The murderers who stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris were motivated by an ideology of hate, however perverted a version of Islam it may have represented. Stephen Hicks was undoubtedly also motivated by hate of some sort when he pointed his gun at three innocent students. But to suggest that Thomas Paine, or Christopher Hitchens, or anyone advocating reason over ideology, or rational enlightenment over fundamentalism, could generically incite such violence demeans not only these gentlemen, but also those who claim such a connection. Lawrence M. Krauss is Director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University, and appears with Richard Dawkins in the recent documentary, 'The Unbelievers.' His most recent book is A Universe from Nothing.

Scientists Lobbying To Restore Pluto As A Planet The campaign also wants the moon to be categorized as a type of planet. Irene Klotz Mar 22, 2017, 02:26 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A team of scientists seeking to restore Pluto to planethood launched a campaign on Tuesday to broaden the astronomical classifications which led to its demotion to a \u201cdwarf planet\u201d a decade ago. Six scientists from institutions across the United States argued that Pluto deserves to be a full planet, along with some 110 other bodies in the solar system, including Earth\u2019s moon. Advertisement In a paper presented at an international planetary science conference at The Woodlands, Texas, the scientists explained that geological properties, such as shape and surface features, should determine what constitutes a planet. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union, struggling with how to classify a newly discovered icy body beyond Pluto, adopted a definition for a planet based on characteristics that include clearing other objects from its orbital path. Pluto and its newfound kin in the solar system\u2019s distant Kuiper Belt region were reclassified as dwarf planets, along with Ceres, the biggest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The decision left the solar system with eight planets. Advertisement But this definition sidelines the research interests of most planetary scientists, said the paper\u2019s lead author, Kirby Runyon, a doctoral candidate at Johns Hopkins University. Runyon said he and other planetary scientists are more interested in a planet\u2019s physical characteristics, such as its shape and whether it has mountains, oceans and an atmosphere. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in the actual intrinsic properties of a world, then the IAU definition is worthless,\u201d he said by phone. Advertisement This NASA's photo of Pluto was made from four images from New Horizons' Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) combined with color data from the Ralph instrument in this enhanced color global view released on July 24, 2015. The images, taken when the spacecraft was 280,000 miles (450,000 kilometers) away, show features as small as 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometers). NASA NASA / Reuters Runyon and colleagues argue that the IAU does not have the authority to set the definition of a planet. \u201cThere\u2019s a teachable moment here for the public in terms of scientific literacy and in terms of how scientists do science,\u201d Runyon added. \u201cAnd that is not by saying, \u2018Let\u2019s agree on one thing.\u2019 That\u2019s not science at all.\u201d Advertisement Runyon\u2019s group advocates for a sub-classification system, similar to biology\u2019s hierarchal method. This approach would categorize Earth\u2019s moon as a type of planet. That idea irks California Institute of Technology astronomer Mike Brown, who discovered the Kuiper Belt object that cast Pluto out of the planet club. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Gorgeous New NASA Image Shows Earth 'Rising' Over The Moon A reminder that our little planet is pretty dang beautiful. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Dec 19, 2015, 11:06 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT NASA released a stunning image on Friday appearing to show Earth \u201crising\u201d over the horizon of the moon. NASA Advertisement The image was captured by NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , a robotic spacecraft that has been orbiting the moon since 2009. Usually, the LRO is used to take images of the moon\u2019s surface, but earlier this year, the LRO\u2019s camera was pointed away from the moon in order to observe the lunar atmosphere. While pointed in that direction, the Earth passed through the camera\u2019s field of view. The stunning picture is actually made up of a series of photos taken in quick succession in mid-October. The LRO has a narrow-angle camera that takes high-resolution images, but in black and white, and a wide-angle camera that takes low-resolution images, but in color. That means that getting a high-resolution image in full color was more complicated than just snapping a photo, and involved some \u201cspecial processing,\u201d a NASA news release stated.

This Could Be 'One Of The Warmest Christmas Days Of Your Lifetime' Baby, it's warm outside. By Hilary Hanson Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Dec 20, 2015, 11:35 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Dreaming of a white Christmas? Depending on where you live, you might want to keep dreaming, according to current weather reports. If you live in the eastern or central United States, Friday could be \u201cone of the warmest Christmas Days of your lifetime,\u201d The Weather Channel reported Sunday. The outlet also noted that the entire Christmas week could be one of the warmest in living memory. Advertisement While this winter\u2019s unusually warm temperatures have been dipping down to more typically cold levels this week, The Weather Channel noted that \u201cabnormal warmth\u201d has begun to return to the central U.S. and is expected to be back in full force in \u201cmost areas east of the Rockies\u201d by Christmas. They do note that a cold front may make Christmas itself slightly less toasty in the Northeast. Read The Weather Channel\u2019s in-depth coverage of the warm weather pattern here. So what\u2019s up with this year\u2019s warm weather ? Though some have pointed fingers at climate change or tropical weather event El Nino , Mike Halpert of the National Weather Service\u2019s Climate Prediction Center credits (or blames, depending on your point of view) the Arctic polar vortex for the high temperatures. The polar vortexes, Halpert explained, are swirling rings of cold winds that surround the North and South Poles. Last year, high air pressure in the Arctic pushed those winds southward, away from the North Pole, causing the chilly U.S. winter many remember. Advertisement This year, the pressure is low, making the vortex stronger than usual and meaning that more cold air is staying around the Arctic, rather than traveling south. The unusually warm temperatures have interrupted bird migration and bear hibernation patterns, and made some species -- like the snowshoe hare, which counts on using its white fur to blend into the snow -- more vulnerable to predators. Right now, forecasts are predicting Christmas Eve temperatures as high as 70 degrees in New York City and 73 degrees in Washington, D.C. Advertisement On the other hand, who trusts weather reports ... right? Right!?!??! We\u2019ll be off crying and dreaming of snow.

New 'Heat Map' Microwave Shows Your Food Change Color As It Cooks Here's How Your Food 'Changes Color' While Heating In A Microwave By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 12, 2015, 10:47 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT You've never seen a microwave quite like this before. A new infrared microwave has been designed to show your food \"changing color\" on a heat map, allowing you to monitor when a meal is completely cooked. For instance, just watch the video above at the 1:10 mark to see what a color-changing frozen burrito would look like. You're welcome. (Story continues below.) A frozen burrito cooking in a microwave. \"It's really hard to guess the cooking time on a frozen burrito ,\" Mark Rober, a former NASA engineer who has created a prototype of the microwave and patented the concept , says in the video. \"Basically, unless you stop the microwave and pull your food out to inspect, there's no way to tell if it's done just right. So as humans, we rely primarily on our sense of sight. So it would be so much better if we could be like the predator and just glance over and see the temperature of our food to tell if it was done, and the amazing news is that is possible now.\" Advertisement How does the microwave work exactly? An infrared camera is attached to the top of the inside of the machine, monitoring the food being cooked. Meanwhile, the front of the outside of the microwave is a screen, displaying a heat map of what the inside camera is filming. As the food cooks, it starts out blue while it's cold, and works its way to red as it heats up. Finally, once the food is heated throughout, it transitions from red to white. Bon app\u00e9tit!
