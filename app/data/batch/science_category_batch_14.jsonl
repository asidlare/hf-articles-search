The Lunar Eclipse Will Be Super Short. Here's How To Watch It Here's Where To Marvel At The 'Blood Moon' By Katie Sola British American covering breaking and viral news Apr 3, 2015, 07:17 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Setting your alarm for the century's shortest total lunar eclipse ? Here are some great options for watching it. At about 3 a.m. PT on Saturday, April 4, the moon will begin to skim across the edge of the Earth's shadow. Totality -- when the moon is completely in Earth's umbra -- will last for a brief five minutes, from about 4:58 a.m. to 5:03 a.m. Advertisement The moon will turn a creepy blood-red . Weather permitting, skywatchers west of the Mississippi will have a clear view of the total eclipse . In the Windy City, moon lovers can enjoy refreshments, listen to lectures, and watch the eclipse at Chicago's Adler Planetarium . The family-friendly viewing party runs from 3:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. local time. On the West Coast? The San Francisco Amateur Astronomers group is setting up telescopes on Ocean Beach. All are invited to come and see the fleeting blood moon. Meanwhile, Oregonians can watch the eclipse at Milo McIver State Park's viewing party. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Adorable Panda Cub Bei Bei Makes A Very Sleepy Public Debut Nap time, all the time. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 17, 2016, 05:19 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Bei Bei is kind of a big deal. But he just doesn't care. The adorable giant panda cub fell asleep -- once again -- during his official public debut at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. In video posted online, zoo biologist Laurie Thompson gently places the 5-month-old cub in his enclosure. But he soon tumbles headfirst onto the floor and immediately starts napping. Advertisement \"He's just tired,\" Thompson says, before opening the exhibit doors to dozens of excited visitors patiently waiting outside. Bei Bei has a habit of dozing off at landmark moments. He snoozed his way through his media debut last month and hardly kept his eyes open during a medical checkup last week. Photographs taken later on Saturday show he did eventually wake up and got on with thoroughly investigating his new surroundings. Advertisement Pandas find it notoriously difficult to reproduce , and Bei Bei and his twin brother -- who sadly died shortly after birth -- were both the result of artificial insemination. Bei Bei, born Aug. 22, lives at the zoo with parents Tian Tian and Mei Xiang and his 2-year-old sister Bao Bao. He's been on display to zoo members since Jan. 8, but Saturday was the first time the general public could catch a glimpse. It's planned that he'll head to China when he's 4 years old to begin fathering even more cute baby panda cubs. Advertisement Can't get to Washington to see Bei Bei? Don't worry, you can still catch up on his antics via the zoo's \"Giant Panda cam\" here .

This Gas Exoplanet Is Evaporating To Reveal A Rocky Core The miniature world -- some 30 light-years from Earth -- could have exotic features like diamond rain and scorching hot oceans. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 3, 2015, 02:31 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Inside of gas giant planets -- such as our solar system's very own Neptune and Uranus -- lie secret, miniature worlds . We've never been able to catch a glimpse of a gas planet's core because of the opaque clouds of gas that tend to hide them. That is, until now. Advertisement The Hubble Space Telescope has been monitoring a Neptune-sized planet outside of our solar system, called GJ 436b , as its immense cloud of mostly hydrogen gas evaporates away to reveal its core. While scientists say that seeing the core is a ways off because only a small percentage of surface gas has evaporated, they're excited about the research opportunity that the alien planet offers. Watch the video above, released by NASA in September, to learn how cores left behind by evaporating gas giants could be a source of Earth-like exoplanets in our universe. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Depression Might Literally Color The Way We See The World (UPDATE) It's possible that feeling sad can make the world appear more gray. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Sep 5, 2015, 07:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Researchers have found that depression may affect the visual perception of color. Credit: Mike Powell/Getty Images UPDATE: The authors of the study covered in this article voluntarily retracted their study from Psychological Science in November 2015 after noticing errors in their methodology. They told the journal they \u201cremain confident in the proposition that sadness impairs color perception\u201d but would conduct revised experiments to \u201cacquire clearer evidence\u201d supporting their conclusion. Previously: Our moods can, quite literally, color our world \u2015 particularly in the case of depression. New research published last week in the journal Psychological Science finds that sadness can affect our vision , making the world appear more gray, by impairing the neural processes involved in color perception. Advertisement As it turns out, there\u2019s a reason we use colors as a metaphor for emotion, with expressions like \u201cfeeling blue\u201d or having a \u201cgray day.\u201d \u201cIt was interesting that we have so many metaphors that link emotion and color perception,\u201d Christopher Thorstenson, a psychology researcher at the University of Rochester and the study\u2019s lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cWe were curious whether there really was a link between sadness and how people see color.\u201d To answer this question, the researchers asked 127 undergraduates to watch either a sad or funny video. Then, the students viewed 48 color swatches \u2015 which were desaturated to the point of being almost gray \u2015 and tried to identify them as red, yellow, green or blue. Those who had watched the sad clip were less accurate in identifying colors than the students who watched the funny clip, suggesting that they were perceiving less of the color. Advertisement The findings build on previous research that investigated the link between mood and perception. Other studies found that when people have a goal to reach or an object to attain \u2015 such as the finish line of a race \u2015 they may perceive that object to be larger than it really is. People experiencing fear, on the other hand, may perceive certain things in their environment \u2015 such as faces with negative expressions \u2015 as more threatening than they actually are. This is because our emotions carry information about the value of objects, and that information is incorporated into the visual perception of our environment. The brain\u2019s emotional and perceptual systems don\u2019t seem to be completely distinct from one another, as was previously believed, but instead engage in a dynamic interplay. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Pinker's Damn: A Na\u00efve Rejection of Controls Over Genetic Engineering Clearly not all experts or genetics researchers are inclined to take the low road by participating in such ethically unacceptable activities. By Stuart A. Newman, Contributor Professor of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical College Professor of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical College Sep 5, 2015, 09:51 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Some scientists like to think of themselves as modern counterparts of Prometheus, the Greek god who brought the creative power of fire to humankind. Privately they may express surprise that an activity - research - in which they take so much satisfaction can (at least potentially) attract public or private funds. But the fact that this occurs, and is indeed routine, only confirms their self-image as foremost among society's heroes. Much rarer is for scientists to question why this money flows to their enterprise, or how science and technology has helped those governmental and commercial institutions with such resources to dispense increase their leverage over everyone else. There are other academics, frequently in quasi-scientific fields, who take it on themselves to publicly congratulate scientists for all the good that they do. How dare anyone presuming to speak on behalf of the public even suggest putting precautionary or ethical obstacles in the way of scientific research and its commercial implementation, they ask. \"Get out of the way,\" barks Steven Pinker, a Harvard psychologist, in a recent Boston Globe op-ed piece . While addressing himself to professional bioethicists ( a notoriously meek lot when it comes to recommendations that would alter the course of technological developments in any meaningful way), Pinker's broader target is a purported pro-disease and pro-death lobby which he claims to be concerned about such things as \"warehouses of zombies to supply people with spare organs.\" Pinker's disingenuous rhetoric notwithstanding, after mammalian cloning was shown to be feasible in the late 1990s, there was in fact active discussion of producing genetically replicate humans (usually conceived as lacking a conscious brain) to provide replacement organs. Advertisement Pinker decries \"perverse analogies with...Nazi atrocities,\" assuring his readers that \"we already have ample safeguards for the safety and informed consent of patients and research subjects.\" He might have benefited from looking into the origins, at the Nazi war crime trials, of the Nuremberg Code , the basis of these \"ample safeguards,\" and the opposition to them while they were being drafted by the American Medical Association, using professionalist arguments much like his own. He might also have considered the evidence that the Code is routinely ignored . Pinker mocks those skeptical of using the new CRISPR/Cas9 gene modification methods for \"editing genomes\" (presumably including those of humans, since his op-ed concerns human health). He supports his call to leave to the experts all decisions as to when, or if, to genetically engineer humans by invoking increased lifespan and decline of disease in prosperous countries - as if these were attributable to biotechnology rather than improved nutrition and sanitation. Genuine advances in medicine due to molecular biology, such as treatments for heart disease and therapies for certain cancers, were arrived at by trial-and-error on volunteers chosen among desperately ill existing people with few alternatives. They were not intended as techniques for irreversible experimental refashioning of prospective people, as germline modification would be. Advertisement Non-specialists may not have the nuanced technical understanding of the CRISPR/Cas9 system that Pinker seems to believe qualifies one to make these decisions (though apparently technical expertise is not needed in order to cheer the scientists on). Anyone who follows the news, however, can read about the brewing industrial battles over patents for \" gene drive technologies \" that would permit a company's preferred genes to displace natural variants, or those of competitors. They might also acquire an alternative perspective on the moral and social compass of some experts by following the stories of computer scientists aiding the government i n the collection of massive amounts of personal data on ordinary citizens, or the design and participation in CIA torture programs by Pinker's fellow members of the American Psychological Association. Clearly not all experts or genetics researchers are inclined to take the low road by participating in such ethically unacceptable activities. The sad reality, however, is that the grip on technology by commercial and governmental centers of power ensures that scientists, whether Manhattan Project researchers (some of whom hoped that the Atomic bomb be used in a demonstration , not on population centers) or well-intentioned developers of antibiotics who have seen their efforts to alleviate disease turn into their opposite , do not control the fruits of their research, notwithstanding the credulousness of certain aficionados of science.

A Call for Data Literacy If we care about young people's privacy, we need to teach them data literacy.

If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email. We are increasingly witness to reports about poor deployments of digital platforms for learning that open up students' information to unintended audiences. This is a scary fact not simply for children but for digital citizens writ large; we are mucking through the \"data age\" and grasping for solutions as we think hard about digital technologies, privacy, and our basic rights. The stories coming from schools offer one important avenue to tackle privacy issues, but they make clear that we need institution-level reform. We need to cultivate students who are not only adept users of technology, but also capable of thinking critically about the costs and benefits of being a \"data point\" in a sea of digital activity. We know from research that children best develop \"21st century skills\" with digital technologies, like computer programming, digital production, and online collaboration, when they can play, create, and share their online creations in a supportive environment of peers and adults. Federal and state education reforms, like Common Core, increasingly mirror these principles. Missing from these reforms are revised data management strategies that ultimately put schools in a tough spot. While schools are expected to integrate technology in the classroom to keep up with our fast-paced world of digital innovations, they are at the same time liable for the consequences of students' digital participation on their online networks. As a result, schools -- particularly those with fewer resources to vet and evaluate digital integration -- haphazardly erect bureaucratic practices that slow its instructional use. These bureaucratic hurdles are practically insurmountable for teachers. Having apps for learning reviewed by school committees can take so long that the platform either cannot be integrated into lesson plans or it's replaced by something else on the market by the time it gets approved. Districts wield their highest level of authority over the router: although many schools today are connected to high speed wireless internet, districts impose blocks and restrictions on websites and apps that are perceived as potential threats, including games and communication platforms, YouTube, and sometimes even basic affordances like search engines. These top-down efforts to maintain privacy for the school and its inhabitants actually stand directly in the face of how we know children learn best: through low-stakes play online with apps and digital tools under the guidance of caring mentors. But, the biggest problem emerges in the lessons students learn about their own data. In my research, I find that as a consequence of schools' digital policing, students come to fear being themselves while online at school. Teachers discipline and punish students for opening YouTube on school computers, for finding apps that allow them to message their peers, or for even flipping between windows on their computers. Students report that they would rather communicate, play, and create and share their digital creations -- a kind of engagement needed for learning -- outside of school, due to anticipated repercussions. The lesson students learn is that their digital footprints at school are the threat -- not the real threats that come from how their data could be used by not only teachers but also voyeurs like private companies or government agencies. If we care about young people's privacy, we need to teach them data literacy. Schools need to provide opportunities to educate children in the politics of data, including what it means, how it can be used, and how they can exert agency over their own position as a \"data point.\" Rather than impose bureaucratic hurdles that blame teachers and their students for isolated privacy breaches, schools must provide youth with the tools they need to navigate the information age as informed digital citizens. For schools to be able to teach data literacy, changes need to be made at the institutional level. I have two ideas to start. Advertisement First, education reformers must partner with the tech industry to pursue an accessible and clear set of guidelines for how student and teacher data are to be used across digital platforms nationwide. Schools need to be able to offload fears of liability for students' privacy into the hands of incredibly well thought out standards for data management that are required by all product developers. This would cut bureaucratic tape at the local level and better enable the kind of low-stakes digital learning and play that we know works. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Second, rather than hide students from the flow of data, we should actively embed youth in our process of negotiating it. Data literacy means developing a critical awareness of what digital footprints mean and how they are used. Let's think of ways to make available to youth the data we collect on them. I bet they'd come up with some interesting ideas for how to move forward.

LEAVE A COMMENT By Julie Louise Bacon , UNSW In July, Harvard scientists used a gene-editing technology first developed in 2013 to programme bacteria to do something astounding: play back an animation of a galloping horse. The GIF animation was generated from an iconic image series created in 1878 by the motion-picture pioneer Eadweard Muybridge . Scientists uploaded a GIF of a galloping horse into live bacteria using Crispr https://t.co/4UKxvXerdc pic.twitter.com/fKCfJM0hXO \u2014 WIRED (@WIRED) July 18, 2017 Advertisement The breakthrough involved the scientists translating image pixels into genetic code, which they fed to the cells one frame at a time. The bacteria incorporated and reproduced the sequence in their DNA, demonstrating the possibility of using living cells as information recording and storage devices. The tech world was, predictably, agog . But beyond the hype , scientists\u2019 goal of applying the technique to human cells has deep philosophical implications. A future in which our bodies are used as hard drives could, in effect, change the entire way we conceive of human history and perceive life. Advertisement My body, myself. Micah Baldwin , CC BY-SA The origins of history Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without history: from the vast array of chronicles housed in the world\u2019s libraries to the countless traces of the past accumulating in the data farms that support the digital cloud, history surrounds us. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. Starting around 4000 BCE, the rise and spread of city-states, from Mesopotamia to Ancient Greece , radically changed the relationship between humans and our physical world. Advertisement New patterns of governance and information technology produced what\u2019s now called \u201chistorical time\u201d, a regime of truth based on evidence and analysis that\u2019s codified in written documents and housed within the walls of archives. These new systems of authority gradually supplanted the sense of time that had previously defined the reality of ancient peoples : the seasons, oral traditions, myths and rituals. With the onset of historical time, change no longer appeared cyclical. The concept of progress emerged, establishing a vision of humankind moving forward, shaping the world, building knowledge and recording evidence of this journey. The city-state era ushered in a new era of timekeeping. Public domain Advertisement But, of course, the whole notion of progress depends on power. Someone (or more likely a certain subset of people) must select the perspectives that count as knowledge. Which events are memorialized and which disappear from history? Thus history is far from neutral. From antiquity onward, those controlling history were a privileged few, nearly always men of political power or professional status. Access required literacy and social mobility. With the Age of Reason came a broad-based questioning of this power. In his 1784 essay \u201c What is Enlightenment? \u201d, Immanuel Kant argued the importance of challenging the authority and legitimacy of practices and norms that restrict the power to reason for oneself. Advertisement Soon after, in 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft published A Vindication of the Rights of Women . Her argument for the education and representation of women in civic life signalled the absence of female voices from history. The book\u2019s emancipatory message was, however, soon subsumed by new forces. The power to systematise reality expanded dramatically in the 19th century, with industrialisation, technological developments and the spread of the scientific method. Photography brought a seeming realism to the documenting of history. Charles Darwin transformed our concept of the origins and timelines of the species and Sigmund Freud described how an individual\u2019s past shapes their psyche. Advertisement These spectacular developments continued in the 20th century. Enabled by modern computing, scientists explored time at a cosmic scale (the theory of relativity) and explained life at a molecular level (the discovery of DNA). In this great tide of change, some 180 years after Kant and Wollstonecraft, a wave of critical movements finally took history to task. Among these critiques was Michel Foucault\u2019s analysis of systems that regulate our physical body and mental states. From The Birth of the Clinic , his 1963 work on the rising authority of medical knowledge, to his 1975 publication on institutions that discipline society , Foucault studied the Western desire for total oversight, famously citing the Panopticon prison model. Advertisement From the critical vantage point, the impact of power \u2013 and of the technologies it employs to represent, monitor and control individuals and populations \u2013 becomes clear. Feminists spoke of the male gaze . Postcolonial theorists pointed to orientalism . And environmentalists have shown how human progress is destroying the physical world . Hence the risks of this recent application of CRISPR: envisaging history as a biological resource rather than a space of social memory is a dramatic shift that leaves history open to radical new forms of exclusion and control. Fusing technology and biology The scientists\u2019 interest in \u201cmolecular recording\u201d in humans and the production of \u201ccell historians\u201d promises to take the management of life, time and the visual arena to new levels. In doing so, they raise the prospect of a Panopticon within. Advertisement Today, progress is increasingly defined by the power of digital technologies to integrate different aspects of human life and abolish the gaps between us. We\u2019re told that social networks, big data and the digital world make us safer, more productive and connected. The advent of gene-editing raises philosophical questions about the Network Age. von_boot/Flickr, CC BY-SA But not everyone agrees. The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman argues that globalisation and the information economy makes for a liquid reality that fragments our attention span, dissolves relationships and produces cultural amnesia. Advertisement The Harvard team proposes an image of history that is not a record of culture \u2013 the ensemble of ways of living, transmitted across generations \u2013 but a sum of the material states of humans. This removes the record of social life that conditions how bodies live. The scientists emphasise the technique\u2019s use in modelling diseases and creating therapies. Those benefits may be real, but so too is what Foucault describes as biopower : the use of wide-ranging technologies to administer and dominate human life. If scientists can embed information in living human cells and extract data, behaviour can be regulated at the deepest levels. Who will decide how the power of molecular recording is wielded, and who has access to the information? Advertisement The ways in which history is made, shared and accessed determine how its power operates and reality is produced. As we both subscribe to and are uploaded into the net of digital reality, the issue of control over data raises new questions of agency. The fact that political and market interests drive the application of science in technology \u2013 with their stealthy logic of monitoring, expansion and profit \u2013 exacerbates questions of control. As the Harvard team\u2019s use of bacteria shows, we\u2019ve come a long way since the single-cell, bacterium-like form that in all likelihood spawned the wonder of life on the planet today. Their gene-editing project demonstrates technology\u2019s capacity to systematise time in new ways. Advertisement It epitomises the conditions of the Network Ages: the compression, acceleration and dispersion of life. But as the richness of life and historical memory demonstrate, culture is more than information, and the diversity of life exceeds technological measure. Can we trust that scientific leaps will produce a future where diversity is supported and divergence is possible? 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

If You Can't Stand the Heat, Get Out of the Universe As we continue this planetary-scale geoengineering experiment of pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and seeing what happens, it's worth considering that maybe this path has already been taken by predecessors a long time ago, in galaxies far, far away.

This image provided by NASA Tuesday Nov. 11, 2009 shows observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory in a collaboration to produce an unprecedented image of the central region of our Milky Way galaxy using infrared light and X-ray light to see through the obscuring dust and reveal the intense activity near the galactic core. Note that the center of the galaxy is located within the bright white region to the right of and just below the middle of the image. The entire image width covers about one-half a degree, about the same angular width as the full moon. Each telescope's contribution is presented in a different color. Yellow represents the near-infrared observations of Hubble. The observations outline the energetic regions where stars are being born as well as reveal hundreds of thousands of stars. Red represents the infrared observations of Spitzer. The radiation and winds from stars create glowing dust clouds that exhibit complex structures from compact, spherical globules to long, stringy filaments. Blue and violet represent the X-ray observations of Chandra. X-rays are emitted by gas heated to millions of degrees by stellar explosions and by outflows from the supermassive black hole in the galaxy's center. The bright blue blob on the left side is emission from a double star system containing either a neutron star or a black hole. (AP Photo/NASA) When these views are brought together, this composite image provides one of the most detailed views ever of our galaxy's mysterious core. The New York Times ran an interesting article back in January by Adam Frank titled \"Is Climate Disaster Inevitable?\" This piece posed an intriguing answer to this puzzling question: Where are all the extraterrestrials? (If you think the answer is \"Roswell, New Mexico,\" go sit with Bigfoot and be quiet -- adults are talking.) Advertisement The Drake equation gives us an order of magnitude feel for how many advanced civilizations there could be in the universe by looking at parameters such as the percentage of stars that have planets, the percentage of those planets which have the right conditions to support life, etc. There are a lot of unknowns in these parameters, but the upshot is that even if one assumes conservative conditions, there should be millions of advanced civilizations out there right now. Enrico Fermi famously phrased the question: \"So where are they?\" thus spawning the eponymous Fermi paradox. With so many potential civilizations, why is the cosmos not saturated with radio signals, with extraterrestrial equivalents of Keeping Up With the Kardashians streaming into space from a thousand different tacky cultures? Despite the implications of the Drake equation, we have never encountered even the slightest hint of extraterrestrial life, not the faintest wisp of a stray radio signal from a distant civilization. SETI is listening diligently, but so far, the universe is sepulchrally quiet. One answer to Fermi's paradox is dark. Uranium is ubiquitous. There's so much uranium in the Earth that it's played an important role in keeping our mantle hot, and hence keeping plate tectonics functioning. (We're the only planet we know of with both life and plate tectonics. The recycling of the crust and its essential elements through tectonics suggests this isn't a coincidence.) Because uranium is everywhere in the universe, any advanced civilization would inevitably discover the basics of fission and learn how to create an atomic bomb. So perhaps the solution to Fermi's paradox is that advanced civilizations inevitably annihilate themselves with nuclear war, as we came so close to doing (and still have the potential to achieve). We don't see UFOs buzzing around because given enough time, each nascent civilization enters a nuclear age -- and they don't make it out. Advertisement That seems unlikely. Sure, it's reasonable to assume that warfare and conflict are not unique to humans, but would that be universally true for all possible civilizations? Millions of them? Surely one would develop along the lines of The Big Lebowski , a civilization populated with alien versions of The Dude, aspiring not to warfare, but only to abide on a comfortable couch, pontificating about how well the rug tied the room together, while sending radio waves into space proclaiming this slacker anthem. So maybe the real answer to Fermi's paradox is climate change. Adam Frank's piece in the New York Times put it this way: Advertisement From climate change to resource depletion, our evolution into a globe-spanning industrial culture is forcing us through the narrow bottleneck of a sustainability crisis. In the wake of this realization, new and sobering answers to Fermi's question now seem possible. Maybe we're not the only ones to hit a sustainability bottleneck. Maybe not everyone -- maybe no one -- makes it to the other side. An interesting thought. While we can't assume life on other planets employs the same chemistry as our M-class planet, with its nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, the issue of energy would still come up. In any variety of energy-providing chemical reactions, organisms would still generate and have to deal with waste products.

It's notable that Earth's atmosphere has already undergone a major shift due to the activities of organisms. Over three billion years of photosynthesizing bacteria transformed the atmosphere from oxygen depleted to our current 21 percent. The oxygen you breathe now is the waste product of biology that stripped carbon from oxygen to form carbohydrates, some of which were later altered into the hydrocarbons now spewing out the tailpipes of stretch Humvees. Advertisement On a vast scale our species pushes this in the other direction, taking carbon and recombining it with oxygen. So far we've been fortunate that our carbon dioxide waste is absorbed in the oceans and used by many other things -- plants, diatoms, mineral weathering -- meaning anthropogenic increases have not been as steep as they could have been. But those natural reservoirs are not infinite, and the rate of carbon dioxide increase is dramatically accelerating. From 1965 to 1974, the rate of carbon dioxide increase averaged 1.06 ppm per year; from 2005 to 2014, the rate doubled to 2.11 ppm per year. As we continue this planetary-scale geoengineering experiment of pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and seeing what happens, it's worth considering that maybe this path has already been taken by predecessors a long time ago, in galaxies far, far away. Why don't we hear them now? Maybe Adam Frank's proposal is right, and our current climate crisis is so intractable that other civilizations have tried and failed and collapsed. But we humans did get through the most dangerous phase of the nuclear era, which for so long seemed guaranteed to end us all. At the very least we have the potential to get through our climate conundrum, which, like the nuclear danger, is a failing of our political systems, not our scientific knowledge. Just as Neo in The Matrix had five predecessors who failed, the universe might need a few tries before finally solving the difficult problem of maintaining a civilization without destroying its planet.

Hawaii Makes Another Big Move Toward 100 Percent Renewable Energy From the behemoths on down, utility-scale solar is having a moment. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Nov 3, 2015, 09:38 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A small island in the middle of the Pacific is doing some big things for renewable energy. By the end of this year, 37 percent of the electricity generated on the Hawaiian Island of Kauai will come from a mix of renewable resources, including solar, hydropower and biomass. The recent completion of the state's largest solar array is a big help toward that goal, as well as toward the aggressive statewide goal of 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. Located in the small town of Anahola, along the island's eastern coast, the 12-megawatt, $54 million facility is 60 acres -- the size of about 45 football fields -- and has 59,000 solar panels. Advertisement Kauai Island Utility Cooperative says it will replace 1.7 million gallons of imported oil per year and generate 20 percent of Kauai\u2019s daytime energy needs -- enough to power 4,000 homes. During daylight hours, about 20 percent of the Hawaiian Island of Kauai' electricity will come from the Anahola project. Kauai Island Utility Cooperative While this is a big step for the Aloha state -- as well as Kauai's public utility co-op, the only utility in the state not owned by Hawaiian Electric Industries -- the Anahola facility pales in comparison to the country's largest solar power plants.

Completed this past June, this 579-megawatt monster in Antelope Valley, California, has more than 1.7 million solar modules and delivers enough electricity to power approximately 255,000 homes . Upon its completion, Green Tech Media heralded it as a sign that \" the utility-scale solar business is alive and well.\" Indeed, from the behemoths like Solar Star to the community-based efforts like Kauai's Anahola facility, utility-scale solar is making its mark across the country.

Dolphin Chooses World's Unluckiest Octopus As A Playmate It's all fun and games until someone loses a tentacle. By Landess Kearns Senior Editor, HuffPost Hawaii Feb 26, 2016, 11:54 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT We humans love dolphins -- they're cute, playful and highly intelligent . What's not to like? Ask an octopus. The unassuming octopus in the photo below was minding its own business last week off Western Australia when an excited bottlenose dolphin scooped it out of the water and began to toss it around. Krista Nicholson, a PhD candidate at Murdoch University, captured photos while conducting research for the Mandurah Dolphin Research Project . Advertisement She saw the dolphin use its nose to toss the octopus into the air , as if to play with it. \" It was absolutely spectacular to watch,\" Nicholson told WA Today. \"It would let it float for a while, then come back and grab it by a tentacle and throw it into the air.\" Nicholson told the Mandurah Coastal Times that she has seen dolphins play with octopuses , but it's rare to get photos of such an encounter. \"It\u2019s not unheard of for dolphins to do this, but it\u2019s not a regular occurrence,\" she said. Dolphins are known to feed on octopuses , so the play date may not have ended well for the eight-armed sea creature. Advertisement But one thing's for sure: The dolphin had a grand time. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

SpaceX Rocket Botches Landing At Sea After Successful Launch One out of four isn't bad when you're trying to land a rocket vertically. By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Jan 17, 2016, 05:16 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT A third at-sea landing attempt proved not to be the charm for billionaire Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. , or SpaceX. On Sunday, SpaceX successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket into orbit and deployed an international ocean-monitoring satellite , but was unable to safely land its 14-story booster on a drone ship off the California coast. Advertisement First stage on target at droneship but looks like hard landing; broke landing leg. Primary mission remains nominal \u2192 https://t.co/tdni53IviI \u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) January 17, 2016 Sunday's failed attempt comes less than a month after SpaceX made history with an epic vertical landing of a Falcon 9 on land, just 6 miles from where it took off at Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was a moment Musk called \" revolutionary \" and a \"critical step along the way to being able to establish a city on Mars.\" Not surprisingly, landing the rockets on floating barges the size of football fields, however, has proven quite a challenge. SpaceX is zero for three in its attempts to do so. Advertisement \"Unfortunately, we are not standing upright on the drone ship right now,\" a SpaceX commentator confirmed for the roughly 100,000 anxious viewers who had tuned into a live webcast but were unable to watch the landing attempt because of a last-minute video problem. #spacex rocket landing feed freezes seconds before landing. Space nerds everywhere freaking out (includes me!) DID IT LAND OR NOT??? \u2014 David Board (@Stage2David) January 17, 2016 Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it to tip over post landing. Root cause may have been ice buildup due to condensation from heavy fog at liftoff. A video posted by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Jan 17, 2016 at 7:07pm PST Advertisement In the wake of Sunday's outcome, Musk explained what went wrong on Twitter: Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 17, 2016 However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 17, 2016 Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. pic.twitter.com/w007TccANJ \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 17, 2016 Advertisement Like previous missions, a successful landing was a secondary test objective , according to SpaceX. The first was to deploy the rocket's payload -- the Jason-3 satellite -- into low orbit, a task that officials said went smoothly. The Jason-3 is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's newest tool for monitoring global sea surface height. Over the long term, it will help track global sea level rise and provide critical ocean information that forecasters need to predict hurricanes and other severe weather before they arrive onshore, according to NOAA. \"Jason-3 will take the pulse of our changing planet by gathering environmental intelligence from the world's oceans,\" Stephen Volz, assistant administrator for NOAA's Satellite and Information Service, said in a release.

Watch live coverage now: https://t.co/KX5g7zfYQe https://t.co/L5su1pDtJx \u2014 NASA (@NASA) January 17, 2016 A SpaceX goal is to develop rockets that can be reused , ultimately making space flight cheaper. Landing the rockets on floating barges, like the one used Sunday and named \"Just Read The Instructions,\" is safer than landing them on land and has a smaller environmental impact. Advertisement In fine form, a SpaceX commentator ended Sunday's webcast Sunday with a subtle tribute to musician David Bowie, who died Jan. 10 at age 69 . \"So until we see you next time, I'd encourage you to look forward and to look up, for the stars look very different today,\" he said, quoting Bowie's 1969 song \"Space Oddity.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Early-Life Stress Could Increase Risk Of Anxiety And Depression Later In Life Being a stressed-out kid can affect the bacteria in your gut -- which can set you up for mental health problems down the line. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Jul 30, 2015, 06:46 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Getty The trillions of organisms living in your digestive tract can literally change the way your brain works. Scientists continue to find more and more evidence of the significant influence of gut bacteria on mental health. Studies have linked gut bacteria imbalances to a host of health issues, including depression , anxiety, autism and Alzheimer's disease , and research has also suggested that a healthy microbiome can contribute to a healthy brain and good mood . Advertisement These issues can be activated at a very young age. New research suggests that a stressful childhood might set you up for gut dysfunction and mental health issues down the road. In a study on mice , which was published this week in the journal Nature Communications, researchers from McMaster University in Canada showed that early-life stress can lead to imbalances in the gut microbiome and contribute to the development of anxiety and depression . \"Early life stress changes the composition and metabolic activity of bacteria in the gut,\" the study's lead author, Dr. Premysl Bercik, a professor of gastroenterology at the university's medical school, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"We postulate that this change is due to altered gut function induced by stress.\" Advertisement The stress-bacteria connection For the study, the researchers subjected infant mice to stress by separating them from their mothers when they were between 3 and 21 days old. After being subjected to maternal separation, the mice had abnormally high levels of the stress hormone corticosterone and displayed anxiety and depression-like behavior. The mice also showed imbalances in gut bacteria, which the researchers attributed to the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in the stress response that communicates between the body and the brain. Then, the researchers repeated the experiment in a germ-free condition where the mice were not exposed to any bacteria. This time, mice also showed high stress-hormone levels and gut dysfunction after being subjected to stress, but they didn't show any signs of anxiety or depression. Advertisement When those same mice were colonized with bacteria, however, they began showing signs of anxiety and depression within a few weeks. What does it all mean? Imbalanced bacteria alone wasn't enough to bring on anxiety and depression. Instead, the findings suggest that the interaction of bacteria and early-life stress may be what determines an individual's likelihood of developing anxiety and depression. \"We are starting to explain the complex mechanisms of interaction and dynamics between the gut microbiota and its host,\" Bercik said in a written statement. \"Our data show that relatively minor changes in microbiota profiles ... can have profound effects on host behaviour in adulthood.\" Advertisement Happy gut, happy brain How does it work? The brain and the gut communicate via gut-brain axis , a mode of bidirectional signaling between the digestive tract and the nervous system. There are several central mechanisms by which gut bacteria can communicate with the brain. First, imbalances in gut bacteria can trigger inflammation by increasing the permeability of the intestinal lining, which allows toxins to seep into the bloodstream. Research has linked pro-inflammatory markers (cytokines) and increased intestinal permeability with anxiety and depression . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Secondly, bacteria can produce neurotransmitters, which are carried through the blood to the brain. Bacteria can also stimulate specific nerves in the gut that then transmit information to the brain, Bercik said. Advertisement Fortunately, you can support gut health (and therefore mental health) by eating a diet that's rich in probiotics -- the \"friendly\" gut bacteria that support digestion and a balanced microbiome, and are known to boost immune and neurological function.

NASA's Kepler Spacecraft In Emergency Mode, 75 Million Miles From Earth The space agency hasn't yet explained why this would happen. By Nina Golgowski Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Apr 10, 2016, 01:05 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING NASA has declared an emergency after discovering that its planet-hunting Kepler Spacecraft, now millions of miles away, is not operating properly. NASA mission operations engineers learned that the spacecraft had switched into emergency mode during scheduled contact on Thursday, the agency announced on Friday. \"EM (emergency mode) is the lowest operational mode and is fuel intensive. Recovering from EM is the team's priority at this time,\u201d NASA stated in a release. Advertisement The agency has not released an explanation for why the spacecraft would shift into emergency mode on its own. Unfortunately, its location -- 75 million miles from Earth -- is only making the situation more challenging for scientists. That distance makes real-time communication impossible. \"Even at the speed of light, it takes 13 minutes for a signal to travel to the spacecraft and back,\" NASA said. Advertisement The Kepler telescope launched into space in 2009 from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It's designed to search the Milky Way for Earth-size planets orbiting in the habitable zone of stars like the sun. Ho New/Reuters The spacecraft, launched in 2009 to seek out Earth-like planets with its telescope, was last confirmed to be fully operational on April 4. NASA scientists didn't discover that it was in emergency mode until they pointed Kepler's telescope toward the center of the Milky Way for a new mission. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The spacecraft has had problems in the past. While it was designed to observe planets for up to six years , two of its reaction wheels failed four years into the mission, in 2013. As a result, it could no longer stay pointed at a target without drifting off course, NASA said. Advertisement Fortunately, it had completed its primary mission by then, detecting nearly 5,000 exoplanets. Scientists were also able to find another use for the telescope, repurposing it for the new \"K2\" mission in 2014 so it can continue to search for exoplanets while conducting research on young stars, supernovae and other astronomical objects.

Science And Sense In A Post-Truth World: How Do We Know? Science And Sense In A Post-Truth World: How Do We Know? By David L. Katz, M.D., M.P.H., Contributor Founder, True Health Initiative Founder, True Health Initiative Sep 29, 2017, 10:22 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT A view of \"exo-planets\" through the Hubble Telescope; Nasa.gov In my work and my world, I am dealing routinely with whiplash-inducing headlines about health, and nutrition in particular (\u201c no, wait, fruits and vegetables are bad for us this week !\u201d) that raise questions about science, sense, and knowledge. When whatever we think we know, however reliably we think we know it, is called into question so routinely, it begs the question: how do we know ? My question is not how do we know any given thing, but rather - how do we know anything, ever, at all? The surprising answer is, we do not. Not unless we decide to trust our nervous systems and the perceptions they engender, for which there is a compelling case. Advertisement We do not, truly, know anything because all we can do is perceive. Were we in a virtual reality, like the one portrayed in the science fiction classic, The Matrix , we would likely be unable to know it, or prove it. We cannot disprove it now, either, since all of our perceptions of all of our disproofs would take place in the same virtual reality, reinforce it, and do nothing to tell us it wasn\u2019t real. We really can\u2019t know anything for sure. But we can choose to have faith in the veracity of our impressions here, and build knowledge from them. If our perceptions are reliable, then what we derive from them is reliable, and so, too, are the embellishments of science, which are, essentially, extensions of our native perceptions via instruments and assays, lenses and equations. It makes sense that our nervous systems and perceptions would be reliable since they are the ones we have here, wherever here is, and thus they are the ones adapted to be here. They are the perceptions that help us survive in this place where we are surviving. Advertisement We can, in effect, choose to have faith in our perceptions, and build our understanding from that foundation. The only alternative is to renounce the reliability of the only reality we know, and never understand anything. Most of us have made the choice long ago, if rather unconsciously. What an intriguing, if ironic opportunity for bridge-building to concede that the origins of science reside in faith. Not faith in supernatural forces; faith in ourselves, faith in our perceptions, faith in our capacity to know- but faith, just the same. Knowledge and knowing do not begin with science, but with our faith in the reliability of constant or consistent patterns we perceive in the world around us. Knowing begins with our senses, and the common sense to trust them. Science, then, extends those perceptions, dispels the denser shadows, reveals the hidden. But there is nothing an electron microscope or the Hubble telescope could show us that would remedy lack of trust in our native capacity to see. Science expands the realm of what we can know, only because knowing is possible in the first place, based on patterns we perceive in the world around us. The more constant the patterns, the more reliable- or even certain- our knowledge. Advertisement We know for certain that our reality is not THE reality, of course. We cannot, for instance, see infrared, or ultraviolet; but we know those wavelengths exist. To see the lesser rainbow bounded by our frail, human vision is to concede that what we \u201csee\u201d is not all there is to see, just our portion of it. The same limits pertain to our other senses. We do not hear ultrasound, but know it exists. We know that solid objects are made up of far more empty space than substance , yet- solid they seem to our fingertips, themselves more empty space than otherwise. Science is not possible without faith in our perceptions, yet science itself tells us how limited those unaided perceptions are. Knowing within our sliver of reality, therefore, comes naturally; all the rest is rather harder. How we know is of practical importance to us every day, for science is being abused. The science of climate change is abused by deniers of the long established and increasingly obvious, an indictment succinctly and elegantly made recently by one of our premier scientists, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson . The science of nutrition and health is abused every time a new round of headlines tell us everything we knew most reliably until yesterday, such as the general benefits of eating vegetables and fruits and legumes, is wrong again. Advertisement We did not suspect, we knew that apples fell down, not up from their trees before Newton. Had Newton\u2019s calculations said otherwise, Newton\u2019s formulas and not the apples would have been wrong. So, too, we know that a passing fixation on lectins does nothing to alter the established benefits of routine consumption of vegetables, fruits, and legumes; nor does a study overlooking the encompassing influence of social factors and environmental circumstance on health. In this post-truth era, we seem to have forgotten, or at least allow ourselves to be mislead routinely about, what science is for. Science is where knowledge extends, not where it begins. How interesting, with regard to diet, that every wild species on the planet knows what to feed itself, while owning no science at all. Our species presumably knew how to feed itself, too, until it started misapplying science to propagate doubt and perpetuate confusion. Advertisement Science is a method, a set of tools, and the most powerful we know, for answering hard questions that do not yield to casual observation and common experience. It is not for refuting what we know reliably and decisively on the basis of those humbler methods. Science cannot tell us that apples fall up out of trees, or that fire puts out water- for these are established as false where knowledge begins, in the realm of our native perceptions. Science is for enhancing knowledge. It can find for us previously unknown things about lectins, and explore for us the idiosyncrasies of electrical fires. The reliability, verifiability, falsifiability, and replicablity of science are to be celebrated by all of us living in a modern world awash in its endowments . But science simply isn\u2019t for unknowing what was constant and clear before ever science was applied to it. We know that apples fall down from their trees and will continue to know that, no matter what new truths are teased out of gravity. We know, as well, that eating apples is good for us this week, as it was last . Advertisement The science of logic tells us something can be necessary but not sufficient, like any one enzyme in a biochemical pathway, or any one station in an assembly line. Common observation tells us something can be sufficient but not necessary, like any one route to a destination when others are at hand, or any one specific diet on a common theme fostering vitality and longevity . Science, for all its independent marvels, depends on sense. Science is a powerful tool, and like any other power tool, can be used well or badly. For it to foster understanding rather than constant confusion in this age of alternative and competing \u201ctruths\u201d on every important topic, we need to use it more sensibly. -fin This column follows a talk I was privileged to give recently to students in a Theory of Knowledge course at the Cheshire Academy taught by Mr. Chip Boyd.

Scientists Use DNA 'Velcro' To Print Human Tissue In The Lab A new technique could one day solve the intractable problem of organ shortages. By Joe Satran Staff Writer, The Huffington Post Sep 4, 2015, 03:07 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An illustration of one of the two types of biological structures -- a vascular network -- created using a new technique developed by a team at UCSF. The Gartner Lab We need more organs. At any given moment, more than 123,000 Americans are waiting for an organ transplant. Each year, 6,500 of them die for want of a donor. Moreover, between 15 and 50 percent of patients lucky enough to receive a transplant from a donor -- depending on the organ -- suffer from acute organ rejection within five years. For that reason, scientists across the country are racing to develop a way to grow organs in the lab. The dream is to eventually use a patient's own cells to construct new kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs that would be impervious to rejection by their immune systems -- in other words, a way to let patients be their own organ donors. Advertisement What makes this hard is that the techniques humans use for manufacturing most things don't work for organs. A car \"has lots of pieces, and they fit together very nicely, and they're guided to the correct position by a human hand or a robot, and then welded together into this complex machine,\" said Dr. Zev Gartner, an associate professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of California, San Francisco . \"Tissues and organs, on the other hand, self-assemble in a process that's guided by rules that are quite distinct from the way that we as humans think about building stuff.\" One key challenge is getting blood vessels to the right place. It's essential, because blood vessels deliver life-sustaining oxygen and nutrients to the cells, but the tiny vessels travel circuitous paths through organs -- surrounded at all times by other types of cells. This week, researchers from Gartner's lab unveiled a technique that could help overcome this obstacle. The team developed a method for assembling living cells (from both mice and humans) into tiny \"organoids\" with a simplified version of the deeply complex structures of actual organs. Advertisement The technique, written up in Nature Methods , is essentially a form of 3D printing -- but it doesn't involve a 3D printer. Instead, it's not totally unlike glitter painting, where little kids draw a pattern in glue, pour a bunch of glitter over it, then shake away the excess to reveal a glittery shape. Except instead of glitter, the scientists used cells -- and instead of glue, they used DNA to make a kind of biological Velcro that affixed the cells in the right place. This video, courtesy of The Gartner Lab and Nature Methods, demonstrates the principles of the technique. All those little circles are cells: Advertisement What makes this technique unusual, though, is that the scientists assigned differently coded strands of DNA to different types of cells. So they were able to specify the location of different types of cells precisely, much as the human body does naturally. \"The DNA has this remarkably ability to only stick to the complementary sequence, and when it finds that complementary sequence, it sticks very, very quickly and specifically,\" Gartner said. \"So what we've done is turn this molecule, which is normally a genetic information carrier, into [...] a multi-flavor Velcro.\" To return to the glitter painting analogy, it's as if you could assign different types of glue to different colors of glitter -- so that if you drew concentric arcs using glues for the seven major colors, poured multicolored glitter over it and shook off the extra, you would be left with a rainbow. Advertisement But the group was working in three dimensions, not two. They built up the organoids atop a piece of glass, layer by layer. Depending on the pattern they started with, that left them with either a cluster of several different types of cells around half the size of a human thumb or a complex branching structure of cells that resembled a vascular system. Gartner's team built these structures using just three or four types of cells, but the technique could, in principle, accommodate any number of cell types. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In the short term, Gartner said, their goal is to use this method to study the development of tissues and the interactions between the cells that make up those tissues. But Gartner hopes to eventually refine the technique enough to use it to build working human organs. Such organs could be used first to test new experimental drugs; they would give researchers a better idea of some drugs' effects on our bodies than today's lab mice do. The hope is that eventually they can act as personalized transplant organs for people whose own organs are failing. Advertisement \"That's a very long-term goal,\" Gartner said. \"Being able to build an organ is the dream, but it's at least a decade away, if not multiple decades away.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

SpaceX Nails Historic At-Sea Rocket Landing \"Fifth time's a charm!\" By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Apr 8, 2016, 05:02 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Before the dust even had time to settle from last week's Tesla Model 3 unveiling, billionaire tech magnate Elon Musk 's other brainchild, SpaceX , celebrated another technological milestone. On Friday, SpaceX successfully delivered a cargo ship, carrying an experimental, balloon-like habitat , to the International Space Station and pulled off a nearly impossible at-sea landing of its rocket booster. Advertisement \"Fifth time's a charm!\" a SpaceX webcast commentator said, as cheers erupted at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. (Story continues below.) The 1st stage of the Falcon 9 just landed on our Of Course I Still Love You droneship.

During a post-launch press conference, Musk said the successful landing is a \"milestone\" in the future of space flight and an exciting day for his team of 5,000 people at SpaceX. What set Friday's launch apart, he said, was that \"the rocket landed instead of putting a hole in the ship, or tipping over,\" drawing laughter from those in attendance. Musk added it's likely the returned booster will be relaunched within a few months, following a series of test fires on the ground. In the future, he said, the hope is that reusing a rocket booster will require little more than giving it a wash and adding propellant. Advertisement Friday's launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, is SpaceX's first cargo resupply mission to the space station since one of its Falcon 9 rockets, carrying 4,000 pounds in research equipment, exploded shortly after liftoff in June . (SpaceX has had recent successes deploying satellites into orbit, however.) Onboard the Dragon spaceship currently en route to ISS are 7,000 pounds of supplies and payloads . Among the most anticipated is the 3,100-pound Bigelow Expandable Activity Module , or BEAM, an \" experimental expandable capsule \" that NASA says could one day be used as habitable structures by space crews traveling to the moon, Mars or other destinations. We\u2019re launching an expandable habitat to @Space_Station on @SpaceX #Dragon Friday. See why: https://t.co/OwFFoEx19w pic.twitter.com/A9xRCk96xE \u2014 NASA (@NASA) April 5, 2016 Advertisement Other experiments onboard Dragon, NASA said, will help the space agency \" assess the impact of antibodies on muscle wasting in a microgravity environment, use microgravity to seek insight into the interactions of particle flows at the nanoscale level and use protein crystal growth in microgravity to help in the design of new drugs to fight disease.\" While SpaceX's at-sea landings remain experimental, they've become the anticipated highlight of each mission. In the wake of last month's crash, Musk hinted that Friday's go-around might be the winner. Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 5, 2016 Advertisement In December, SpaceX made history when a Falcon 9 landed successfully on land about 6 miles away from where it took off. Musk called it a \u201c revolutionary \u201c moment and a \u201ccritical step along the way to being able to establish a city on Mars.\u201d By developing rockets that can be reused , SpaceX ultimately hopes to make space flight cheaper and easier. While it costs between $200,000 to $300,000 to refill the rocket, the rocket itself costs $60 million, Musk said during Friday's press conference. Musk said the eventual goal is for such landings not to draw such interest. \"We\u2019ll be successful, ironically, when it becomes boring,\" Musk said. The space community came out in force Friday to congratulate SpaceX on its successful launch and landing. President Barack Obama chimed in with a word of congratulations too. Advertisement Congrats SpaceX on landing a rocket at sea. It's because of innovators like you & NASA that America continues to lead in space exploration. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) April 8, 2016 Congrats to the @SpaceX team & @ElonMusk !

Neptune's Massive New 'Dark Vortex' Is As Big As The United States The high-pressure system is accompanied by bright \"companion clouds.\" By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Jun 24, 2016, 02:46 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING An unusual new feature has appeared on Neptune: a \"dark vortex\" so massive that it would swallow the United States if it was here on Earth. \" Dark vortices coast through the atmosphere like huge, lens-shaped gaseous mountains ,\" Berkeley research astronomer Mike Wong, who led the team that analyzed the Hubble data, said in a news release. \"And the companion clouds are similar to so-called orographic clouds that appear as pancake-shaped features lingering over mountains on Earth.\" Advertisement A dark vortex on Neptune is a high-pressure system that usually is accompanied by bright \"companion clouds,\" NASA said. \" We speculate that these dark spots on Neptune (which are most visible at blue wavelengths) are probably 'clear' areas , openings in the cloud decks that see to deeper layers,\" Heidi Hammel, a researcher at the Space Science Institute , told Astronomy magazine. \"The bright companions (which are most visible at redder wavelengths) are thought to be higher-altitude clouds.\" Those companion clouds form by air being diverted over the vortex, which then causes gases to freeze, probably into methane ice crystals, NASA said. Advertisement The new \"dark vortex\" is seen in a full visible-light image at left near a patch of bright clouds. The full-color image at top right is a close-up while the image at bottom right shows the vortex in blue wavelengths. NASA, ESA, and M.H. Wong and J. Tollefson (UC Berkeley) The bright companion clouds were first spotted last summer by several observers, including amateur astronomers, who suspected that they might be indications of a dark vortex. However, since the vortex was best viewed in blue wavelengths, more detailed observation required aiming the Hubble Space Telescope at the feature. Hubble's image taken last month confirmed the vortex. While a similar feature was spotted by Voyager 2 in 1989, this was the first one seen on the planet in the 21st century. Advertisement \"Neptune's dark vortices have exhibited surprising diversity over the years, in terms of size, shape and stability (they meander in latitude, and sometimes speed up or slow down),\" the space agency said. \"They also come and go on much shorter timescales compared to similar anticyclones seen on Jupiter; large storms on Jupiter evolve over decades.\" Also on Thursday, NASA announced that it had extended Hubble's science operations for another five years -- until 2021. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Rex's Big, Knife-Like Teeth So Strong Only one modern-day animal has teeth like the carnivorous dinosaur, scientists say. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 28, 2015, 03:22 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT There's no doubt Tyrannosaurus rex -- and other carnivorous dinosaurs -- had some terrifying chompers. But what made the teeth of these dinosaurs strong enough to effortlessly tear through the flesh and bone of their prey? The serrated teeth of T. rex and other fearsome dinos had complex structures hidden inside to strengthen them , according to a study published Tuesday in Scientific Reports . \"The strange structure is actually a special arrangement of tooth tissues that increases the size of the serration, strengthening it and preventing it from wearing away quickly,\" Dr. Kirstin Brink, the study's lead author and a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Toronto-Mississauga in Canada, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"The fact that theropod teeth are quite more complex than previously thought was a surprise to me.\" Advertisement University of Toronto Mississauga For the study, Brink and her colleagues examined teeth from eight different species of theropod. Theropods -- the group of bipedal dinosaurs that includes T. rex , Allosaurus , Coelophysis and Gorgosaurus -- roamed the Earth about 200 million years ago and were dominant terrestrial meat-eaters , Reuters reports. Scientists knew about the strange tissue structures inside theropod teeth before this study, but hadn't been able to determine if the structures were caused by stress on the teeth, Brink said. Advertisement Using a scanning electron microscope to take images of the teeth and a synchrotron microscope to examine their chemical composition, researchers analyzed both immature teeth that were not large enough to be used for feeding and mature teeth. They found that both immature and mature theropod teeth had the unique tissue structures, which suggests the structures did not develop from stress over time but were a part of the teeth's biology from the animal's early development. \"This brought about a developmental explanation for the tooth formation ; the serrations are even more spectacular and permanent,\" study co-author Dr. Robert Reisz , biology professor and vice dean of graduate studies at the University of Toronto-Mississauga, said in a written statement. Advertisement Danielle Dufault. The researchers also concluded that the arrangement of the tissue structures were present in all theropods except the small Troodon . 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By Chris D'Angelo Senior Reporter, HuffPost Feb 26, 2016, 10:20 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT NASA's primary focus is the cosmos, but the space agency has a surprising and significant impact on everyday technologies we use on Earth. NASA, in many ways, is America's research laboratory. Since 1976, the NASA publication Spinoff has profiled nearly 2,000 space technologies that have made their way -- in one way or another -- into the private sector, including baby formula, swimsuit designs, Dustbuster cleaners and protective firefighter gear. In celebration of Spinoff\u2019s 40th year , the agency took a look back at what it says are the top 40 technologies that have had the greatest impact on Earth. Below, NASA explains how 10 of these life-changing innovations came straight from the heavens. Advertisement Digital Image Sensors Adam Hester via Getty Images \"Whether you take pictures and videos with a DSLR camera or a cell phone, or even capture action on the go with a device like a GoPro Hero, you\u2019re using NASA technology . The CMOS active pixel sensor in most digital image-capturing devices was invented when NASA needed to miniaturize cameras for interplanetary missions. It is also widely used in medical imaging and dental X-ray devices.\" -NASA Enriched Baby Formula KidStock via Getty Images \"While developing life support for Mars missions, NASA-funded researchers discovered a natural source for an omega-3 fatty acid previously found primarily in breast milk that plays a key role in infant development. The ingredient has since been added to more than 90 percent of infant formula on the market and is helping babies worldwide develop healthy brains, eyes and hearts.\" -NASA Memory Foam Vladimir Tomovic via Getty Images \"Perhaps the most widely recognized NASA spinoff, memory foam was invented by NASA-funded researchers looking for ways to keep test pilots cushioned during flights . Today, memory foam makes for more comfortable beds, couches and chairs, not to mention better shoes, movie theater seats and even football helmets.\" -NASA Advertisement Food Safety Standards NASA/Tumblr \"Looking to ensure the absolute safety of prepackaged foods for spaceflight, NASA partnered with the Pillsbury Company to create a new, systematic approach to quality control . Now known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), the method has become an industry standard that benefits consumers worldwide by keeping food free from a wide range of potential chemical, physical and biological hazards.\" -NASA Swimsuit Designs Henrik Sorensen via Getty Images \"Wind-tunnel testing at NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center played a key role in the development of Speedo\u2019s LZR Racer swimsuit, proving which materials and seams best reduced drag as a swimmer cuts through the water. The swimsuit made a splash during its Olympic debut in 2008, as nearly every medal winner and world-record breaker wore the suit. Full-body swimsuits, such as the original LZR Racer, have since been disallowed from international competitions, but a modified version of the suit continues to be popular among professional competitors.\" -NASA Scratch-Resistant, UV-Reflecting Lenses Goodshoot via Getty Images \"Some of the earliest research into effective scratch-resistant coatings for prescription and sunglass lenses drew from work done at Ames Research Center on coatings for astronaut helmet visors and plastic membranes used in water purification systems. Then, in the 1980s, NASA developed sunlight-filtering lenses to provide eye protection and enhance colors, and these lenses have found their way into sunglasses, ski goggles and safety masks for welders.\" -NASA Advertisement Dustbuster EHStock via Getty Images \"An Apollo-era partnership with Black & Decker to build battery-operated tools for moon exploration and sample collection led to the development of a line of consumer, medical and industrial hand-held cordless tools, including the popular Dustbuster cordless vacuum .\" -NASA Emergency Blankets ARIS MESSINIS via Getty Images \"So-called space blankets, also known as emergency blankets, were first developed by NASA in 1964 . The highly reflective insulators are often included in emergency kits and are also used by long-distance runners after finishing a race to avoid a large swing in body temperature. They have been incorporated into outdoor clothing and sleeping bags as well.\" -NASA Anti-Icing Technology ASSOCIATED PRESS \"NASA has spent many decades solving problems related to ice accumulation on the wings and in the engines of aircraft. Spinoffs from this research include not only technologies for aircraft but de-icing formulations for train tracks , as well.\" -NASA Advertisement Firefighter Protection Bill Stormont via Getty Images \"NASA helped develop a line of polymer textiles for use in spacesuits and vehicles. Dubbed PBI, the heat- and flame-resistant fiber is now used in numerous firefighting, military, motor sports and other applications.\" -NASA Surprised? There's plenty more where that came from.

Humans Feel Empathy For Robots, Scientists Find Researchers in Japan discover neurological evidence that we empathize with robots \"in pain.\" By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Nov 3, 2015, 02:56 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Researchers in Japan are studying whether humans can feel empathy for robots. Marcelo Santos via Getty Images The ability to feel empathy toward others is supposed to be an innate human ability. But when we refer to \"others,\" does that include robots? New research suggests it does. A study from Japan , published on Nov. 3 in the journal Scientific Reports, offers new neurophysiological evidence that humans can have an empathetic reaction to humanoid robots -- and represents a major step toward understanding how we interact with them. Advertisement For the study, a group of psychologists and engineers from Toyohashi University of Technology and Kyoto University analyzed how the brains of 15 healthy adults reacted to seeing human-like robots \"in pain.\" The study results are preliminary, due to the small sample size. Researchers monitored electrical activity in the participants' brains through electroencephalography, or EEG, as the research subjects viewed various images of humans or robots in painful and non-painful situations. Some examples of those images can be seen below. Examples of the painful and non-painful images that researchers used in the study. Scientific Reports Advertisement The researchers found that parts of the participants' brains associated with empathy were active when they viewed both humans and robots in painful situations. However, the EEG results revealed that their brains responded slightly more slowly to the robot images. \"This process [of showing empathy for robots] takes ... 350 milliseconds or more to recognize the situation and affect our cognition or consciousness,\" said Michiteru Kitazaki, a cognitive neuroscientist at Toyohashi and a co-author of the study, in an email to The Huffington Post. Thus, Kitazaki explained, the participants did not seem to experience the same \"contagious or automatic empathy\" toward robots that they felt toward humans. The researchers concluded that we seem to empathize with humanoid robots in a way that is similar to how we empathize with humans, but our response toward robots may be somewhat weaker because we can't immediately put ourselves in a robot's place. Advertisement \"This could mean that we only show empathy towards a robot once we classify it as something similar to an animate creature,\" Noel Sharkey, a professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at the University of Sheffield in England, told Al Jazeera America . \"This is a very important start to our understanding of empathy towards inanimate objects.\" One day, scientists may be able to create robots specially designed to trigger empathy -- a helpful quality for robots to possess if they help or interact with humans. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Animals Kept In Deep Freeze For 30 Years Brought Back To Life One of the revived tardigrades even managed to reproduce. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 17, 2016, 03:55 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Microscopic creatures kept frozen for more than three decades have been successfully brought back to life. The 1mm long tardigrades were collected from a frozen moss sample in Antarctica in 1983, according to a new paper published in the journal Cryobiology. Advertisement Japan's National Institute of Polar Research stored the 8 legged, segmented critters at -4F for just over 30 years. They thawed and revived two of the animals, which are also known as water bears or moss piglets, in early 2014. The previous record for a tardigrade being revived from a deep freeze was 8 years. Credit: Photolibrary via Getty Images One of them died 20 days into the experiment , reports the BBC. But its companion survived and managed to reproduce with a third tardigrade that had been hatched from a frozen egg. It went on to lay 19 eggs, of which 14 survived. Advertisement Tardigrades, found living in water across the world, are renowned for being tough and have previously survived several days after being blasted into space . According to Japan's The Asahi Shimbun newspaper, their metabolism shuts down and they enter a cryptobiotic state when faced with low temperatures. The previous record for tardigrades surviving extreme cold was eight years. \"The present study extends the known length of long-term survival in tardigrade species considerably,\" researchers wrote in the newly released paper. Advertisement A nematode worm was revived after 39 years in deep freeze. Credit: STEVE GSCHMEISSNER via Getty Images Lead researcher Megumu Tsujimoto said the team now wants to \"unravel the mechanism for long-term survival by looking into damage to tardigrades' DNA and their ability to repair it.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Weird Goblin Planet Found On The Edge Of Solar System The dwarf planet is new evidence of the long-sought Planet X. By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Oct 3, 2018, 05:00 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A strange little dwarf planet with a colorful name is giving astronomers new evidence in the hunt for Planet X . The Goblin is a newly confirmed dwarf planet that travels to the fringes of the solar system. Formally known as 2015 TG387, the nickname came from the \u201cTG\u201d part of the designation along with the fact that it was first seen around Halloween of 2015, according to the Carnegie Institution for Science. Advertisement The organization also released an artist\u2019s conception of The Goblin: Carnegie Institution for Science The dwarf planet is currently about two-and-a-half times farther from the sun than Pluto is right now, but it\u2019s in an elliptical orbit so extreme that it will eventually be some 67 times the distance from the sun as Pluto and into the Inner Oort cloud. Carnegie Institution for Science Advertisement With a diameter of just 186 miles, The Goblin is also on the small side, even for a dwarf planet. \u201c We think there could be thousands of small bodies like 2015 TG387 out on the solar system\u2019s fringes, but their distance makes finding them very difficult,\u201d the University of Hawaii\u2019s David Tholen said in a news release. \u201cCurrently we would only detect 2015 TG387 when it is near its closest approach to the sun. For some 99 percent of its 40,000-year orbit, it would be too faint to see.\u201d Scientists said The Goblin\u2019s orbit \u2015 and the orbits of similar objects at the far reaches of the solar system \u2015 suggest they are being shepherded by the gravity of Planet X. That\u2019s a theorized, but as yet unseen, planet several times the size of Earth somewhere on the edge of the solar system.

Marcia Dunn Sep 3, 2022, 11:37 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT NASA's Artemis I rocket sits on launch pad 39-B at Kennedy Space Center on Saturday, Sept. 3. Joe Raedle via Getty Images CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 NASA\u2019s new moon rocket sprang another dangerous fuel leak Saturday, forcing launch controllers to call off their second attempt to send a crew capsule into lunar orbit with test dummies. The first attempt earlier in the week was also marred by escaping hydrogen, but those leaks were elsewhere on the 322-foot (98-meter) rocket, the most powerful ever built by NASA. Advertisement There was no immediate word on when NASA might try again. After Tuesday, a two-week launch blackout period kicks in. Extensive fuel leak repairs could require that the rocket be hauled off the pad and back into its hangar, possibly pushing the flight into October. Launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson and her team tried to plug Saturday\u2019s leak the way they did the last time: stopping and restarting the flow of super-cold liquid hydrogen in hopes of removing the gap around a seal in the supply line. They tried that twice, in fact, and also flushed helium through the line. But the leak persisted. Blackwell-Thompson finally halted the countdown after three to four hours of futile effort. \u201cWe have a scrub for the day,\u201d announced NASA\u2019s launch commentator, Derrol Nail. NASA wants to send the crew capsule atop the rocket around the moon, pushing it to the limit before astronauts get on the next flight. If the five-week demo with test dummies succeeds, astronauts could fly around the moon in 2024 and land on it in 2025. People last walked on the moon 50 years ago. Advertisement After days of stormy weather, the weather cooperated early Saturday as the launch team began loading nearly 1 million gallons of fuel into the Space Launch System rocket . But minutes into the operation, hydrogen fuel began seeping from the engine section at the bottom of the rocket, violating safety rules. During Monday\u2019s launch attempt, hydrogen fuel escaped from elsewhere in the rocket. Technicians tightened up the fittings over the past week, but Blackwell-Thompson cautioned that she wouldn\u2019t know whether everything was tight until Saturday\u2019s fueling. Advertisement Even more of a problem on Monday, a sensor indicated one of the rocket\u2019s four engines was too warm, but engineers later verified it actually was cold enough. The launch team planned to ignore the faulty sensor this time around and rely on other instruments to ensure each main engine was properly chilled. Mission managers accepted the additional risk posed by the engine issue as well as a separate problem: cracks in the rocket\u2019s insulating foam.

Mars One Mission Called 'Unsustainable,' And Here's Why We might be able to live on Mars one day, but it won't be easy. By Elisabeth Brier HuffPost Live Intern Sep 3, 2015, 09:01 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The finalists for the Mars One mission might want to think twice before accepting that one-way ticket to the red planet, according to Sydney Do, a graduate research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mars One is an initiative to establish a permanent human settlement on the planet. But speaking to HuffPost Live on Wednesday, Do said that doing so would be \"unsustainable\" and \"unfeasible\" due to cost. Advertisement He explained: A one-way mission inherently goes on forever, so as soon as the crew members land on the surface, you have to keep them alive for 50 to 70 years or however long you expect them to live. To keep the systems going, you need to continually send spare parts to the surface of Mars over time... the technology that is required is just not there yet.

We Were\u00a0Supposed to Be on Mars by Now! Why Aren't We? Much of the opposition to Mars exploration is based on disinformation and distraction tactics that imply or even claim outright that Mars would bust the budget or endanger Social Security, which, given actual budgetary facts and context, is preposterous. By Chris Carberry, Contributor CEO, Explore Mars CEO, Explore Mars Mar 30, 2015, 11:01 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

Humanity's advancement into space has not progressed quite as predicted. In the 1960s and 1970s, futurists, as well as science fiction movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey or the old campy television show, Space 1999 , took it for granted that regular passenger flights, moon bases, interplanetary exploration, and other extraordinary advancements in space would be a reality before the end of the 20th Century. We have obviously fallen well short of that vision, but as fantastical as that speculation may seem today, it wasn't entirely based on wishful thinking or flights of fancy. After the United States successfully landed humans on the moon, there were high level discussions at NASA and elsewhere that advocated for sending humans to Mars by the mid-1980s. In view of the truly remarkable speed in which America achieved the Moon landings, Mars by the 1980s didn't seem all that far-fetched at the time. Unfortunately, political reality interceded. After convincingly beating the Soviets to the moon and after only a few successful landings, funding for the Apollo Program was canceled, and instead the focus of the space program was shifted in a direction that would leave us circling in Low Earth Orbit for 45 years. Which brings us to the present day. Sending crewed missions to Mars by the mid-2030s is now an integral part of official U.S. space policy. Public discourse has swelled on this topic since the successful test of the Orion capsule this past December as well as the discovery of organics, nitrogen, and evidence of an ancient ocean on Mars. But, is this objective realistic or is this truly a case of wishful thinking? Advertisement Several factors have recently materialized that could finally set us on a course to Mars and elsewhere in the solar system. The first and perhaps most important factor is that there is far more consensus on Mars exploration than there ever has been before within NASA, within the aerospace community, and among policy makers. Not everyone agrees on how we will get there or where we will go along the way, but Mars by the mid-2030s is the majority consensus. A unified coalition of these players could have a powerful and lasting impact. Recent polling also suggests that there is strong public support for human missions to Mars when actual NASA budget levels are understood by poll participants. One of the biggest issues commonly raised regarding Mars missions is whether we can actually afford to go to Mars. However, the answer to that question appears to be 'yes.' Advertisement Much of the opposition to Mars exploration is based on disinformation and distraction tactics that imply or even claim outright that Mars would bust the budget or endanger Social Security, which, given actual budgetary facts and context, is preposterous. Many aerospace experts believe that humans to Mars can be achieved without large increases in the NASA budget; indeed, that most increases would be attributable to the need to counter inflation. One can therefore argue that it would be fiscally responsible for NASA to commit to sending humans to Mars rather than spending a similar level of funding on less ambitious or constantly changing goals. Timing and circumstances enabled President John F. Kennedy's call in the early 1960's for America to land a crew on the Moon before that decade was out to become reality. We can't replicate the circumstances that existed in that decade, and we shouldn't even try; for while Apollo was a spectacular success, it proved not to be a sustainable model for space exploration. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

While presidential leadership is still important, we may not need another Kennedy-esque presidential speech. Momentum for Mars exploration is developing far more organically than other human mission objectives in the past. Rather than the program being dictated from top to bottom, we seem to be building (at least the overarching goals) from bottom to top. This is quite significant and may be the interplanetary 'missing link' that could create the political sustainability required for a long-term program. Indeed, these and other current topics will be the focus of the Humans to Mars Summit , taking place in Washington, D.C. from May 5 to 7, 2015. Advertisement Humans won't be visiting a nearby star or even the moons of Jupiter anytime soon, but we may finally have the opportunity to move out into space and on to Mars -- to explore, to discover, and to develop.

Amazing Image Shows Pluto's Frozen Canyons Take a closer look at the planet's impressive landscape. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Feb 26, 2016, 02:33 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The remarkable topography of a dwarf planet. NASA Pluto certainly is stunning from 21,100 miles away. NASA released an image on Thursday that shows the frozen canyons and valleys surrounding the dwarf planet's north pole. The New Horizons spacecraft captured the \"ethereal scene\" in July, NASA said. The image's colors have been enhanced to provide a particularly enlightening look at the region's topographical features. Advertisement An annotated version of the photos highlights particular canyons , pits and valleys. The graphic below shows the area's largest canyon, which is 45 miles wide, in yellow. A valley (marked in blue) runs along the length of the canyon floor. Several \"subsidiary canyons\" (shown in green) run roughly parallel and each measure about 6 miles wide. Another valley (in pink) can be seen further to the right. Red markings \"indicate locations where subsurface ice has melted or sublimated from below, causing the ground to collapse,\" according to NASA. An annotated version of the image points out special features in Pluto's north pole region.

Your Brain Is Wired To Move On After Heartbreak, Study Says Breaking Up And Moving On Is As Natural To Us As Falling In Love By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Mar 28, 2015, 07:30 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT We know that humans are wired to fall in love, but are we also built to break up? Love is what evolutionary psychologists call a human universal -- a fundamental human experience that appears across all cultures. According to a new study, the experience of falling out of love and moving on to a new partner may be just as universal. A recent review of evolutionary psychology literature, conducted by researchers at Saint Louis University, Florida State University and the University of Cincinnati , suggests that humans are built to experience the pain of a breakup and then move on to a new partner, and that our brains actually facilitate the severing of romantic ties. The researchers explain that the ability to endure heartbreak and ultimately enter a new relationship may have offered an evolutionary advantage. Advertisement \"In our evolutionary past, selection pressures may have been such that individuals who could successfully jettison a mate and find a new one, when the situation called for it, would have been better able to solve the evolutionary imperative of reproduction -- in other words, they sent more of their genes on to the next generation,\" Dr. Brian Boutwell, an epidemiologist at Saint Louis University and the study's lead author, told The Huffington Post. Boutwell and his colleagues looked at the process of falling out of love and ending a relationship (what they call \"primary mate ejection\") and the process of entering a new relationship (\"secondary mate ejection\"). Drawing on research showing that the brain circuitry involved in romantic love is also implicated in addictive behaviors , they hypothesized that falling out of love and moving on is a process akin to overcoming a drug addiction. And of course, those who are able to do so successfully have better survival and reproductive odds. The findings also show that while both men and women fall out of love and move on to new romantic relationships, they are likely motivated to break up for different reasons. Advertisement \"Males would be especially likely to jettison a mate when they expect that a partner has been sexually unfaithful,\" Boutwell said in an email. \"Females, on the other hand, would be expected to jettison a mate when they have become unable (or unwilling) to provide resources and to ensure the survival and safety of the female and her offspring.\" So what does this say about monogamy? The study suggests that humans are indeed wired to be with just one person -- but not necessarily for a lifetime. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Why Human Wellness Is Critical To Combating Climate Change A new paper reveals seven important social concepts needed for a sustainable future. By Carolyn Gregoire Senior Writer, The Huffington Post Apr 5, 2016, 11:46 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT In the fight for a sustainable future, a new paper explains why we need the insights of social scientists. Ron Chapple Stock via Getty Images In conversations around tackling climate change and creating a sustainable future, we've tended to forget one very important piece of the puzzle: creating healthy and just societies. The key to building such a future may depend on our ability to understand how our own well-being is tied to that of the natural world, some psychologists say. Advertisement In a new paper published in the journal Science on Friday, social scientists from the U.S. and the U.K. called for environmental science and the social sciences to come together in combating ecological destruction. \"Sustainability is ultimately about balance -- balancing people's differing needs and desires with those of their environment so that both people and nature can persist,\" Dr. Christina Hicks, a lecturer at the Lancaster Environment Centre in England and the paper's lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. \"People will necessarily strive to achieve greater well-being, but what that well-being consists of can and will vary.\" The paper identifies seven key social indicators that should inform policies and practices around sustainability: Advertisement well-being culture values equality justice power agency (self-determination) These concepts have largely been absent from society-wide sustainability goals, according to the paper's authors. \u201c\"Sustainability is ultimately about balance -- balancing people's differing needs and desires with those of their environment so that both people and nature can persist.\"\u201d - Dr. Christina Hicks, environmental social scientist Without some focus on these concepts, we might risk taking actions that may protect the planet but are incompatible with human well-being -- or vice versa. Any large-scale measures taken to protect the environment that do not promote equality, for instance, are unlikely to be successful in the long run, the paper's authors explain. Advertisement \"Lasting sustainability will hinge on fair and just solutions ,\" Hicks said in a statement. In creating these solutions, the paper's authors argue that we need to bring together the expertise of many disciplines -- including psychology, sociology, economics and other social sciences. \"We are really beginning to recognize what an important role social science has to play when it comes to climate change and ecological destruction,\" Hicks said. \"Whereas there is solid scientific agreement on what needs to happen, we are struggling when it comes to how we should get there. ... Social science can help us understand how and why we have gotten into the situation we are in, how people are likely to respond to changes in the near and long term future, and why in the face of so much evidence there is still inaction.\" Here's an example of how social science can inform sustainable solutions: A two-year anthropology project examined and tracked the progress of wild food practices as part of Seattle's Urban Forest Stewardship Plan . Advertisement \"The Forest Commission consulted the research and determined that urban wildlands have diverse values for people,\" paper co-author Melissa Poe, a social science liaison with the Northwest Fisheries Science Center and Washington Sea Grant, told HuffPost, noting that the study resulted in changes that made the program more effective. And in terms of inequality, social indicators have been used to identify \"climate equity hotspots,\" where risk factors like poverty, poor education and low access were used to isolate communities that are disproportionately vulnerable to climate risks, according to Poe. The new paper is part of a growing movement to bring the insights of social science into the fight against climate change. Creating a sustainable future is a challenge with emotional, moral and psychological dimensions, and behavioral scientists are now taking action to better understand the complex relationship between humans and nature. Advertisement \u201cIt\u2019s a very new terrain we\u2019re in,\u201d said Dr. Renee Lertzman, a San Francisco-based psychosocial researcher whose work focuses on promoting climate change action in organizational settings, told HuffPost in a previous article . \u201cThat\u2019s the exciting part \u2026 It\u2019s very innovative and it\u2019s very emerging. But we have to get to the point where we really can be open to new and different ways of looking at things.\u201d Hicks agreed that it's time to take risks, build respect and merge disciplines to come up with new solutions to the global ecological crisis. \"We need to be bold and step outside our comfort zones to develop methods for assessing complex concepts that can be communicated and heard across disciplines and at a variety of policy scales,\" she said. \"We need to consider different forms of knowledge, try understanding familiar things in different ways and let this form the basis for sustained dialogue and debate about how sustainability is understood.\" Advertisement Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

NASA\u2019S Cassini Spacecraft\u2019s 13-year Saturn Mission Ends In Fiery Space Crash Farewell Cassini. By Ian Simpson Sep 15, 2017, 04:47 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. space agency NASA received the final signal from its Cassini spacecraft, which ended a groundbreaking 13-year Saturn mission on Friday with a meteor-like plunge into the planet\u2019s atmosphere, transmitting data until the final moment. Cassini, the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn, ended its mission at 7:55 a.m. EDT (1155 GMT), shortly after it lost contact with Earth as it entered the gas giant\u2019s crushing atmosphere at about 70,000 miles an hour (113,000 km per hour), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said.

The craft\u2019s discoveries included seasonal changes on Saturn, a hexagon-shaped pattern on the north pole and the moon Titan\u2019s resemblance to a primordial Earth. Cassini also found a global ocean on the moon Enceladus, with ice plumes spouting from its surface. Enceladus has become a promising lead in the search for places where life could exist outside Earth. The spacecraft has produced 450,000 images and 635 gigabytes of data since it began probing Saturn and its 62 known moons in July 2004. Advertisement NASA's Cassini spacecraft is shown diving through the plume of Saturn's moon Enceladus, in 2015, in this photo illustration. NASA NASA / Reuters Cassini is a cooperative project between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, and was launched into space in October 1997 from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Since the spacecraft was running low on fuel, NASA crashed it into Saturn to avoid any chance the spacecraft could someday collide with and contaminate Titan, Enceladus or another moon that has the potential for indigenous microbial life. Advertisement Cassini started a series of 22 orbital dives in April, using Titan\u2019s gravity to slingshot itself into the unexplored area between the planet and its rings. The spacecraft studied Saturn\u2019s atmosphere and took measurements to determine the size of the planet\u2019s rocky core. NASA scientists have said Cassini\u2019s final photo as it heads into Saturn\u2019s atmosphere will likely be of gaps in the rings caused by tiny moons. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

In A Deadly Crash, Who Should A Driverless Car Kill -- Or Save? It's one of the thorniest moral dilemmas in tech right now. By Bahar Gholipour On Assignment For HuffPost Jun 23, 2016, 05:23 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT People can\u2019t make up their moral minds about driverless cars. In a series of surveys published Thursday in the journal Science , researchers asked people what they believe a driverless car ought to do in the following scenario: A group of pedestrians are crossing the street, and the only way the car can avoid hitting them is by swerving off the road, which would kill the passengers inside. The participants generally agreed that the cars should be programmed to sacrifice their passengers if doing so would save many other people. Advertisement This, broadly speaking, is a utilitarian kind of answer -- one aimed at preserving the greatest possible number of lives. But there's one problem: The people in the survey also said they wouldn't want to ride in these cars themselves. It would be OK for others to buy them, the participants said, but they personally would not. \u201cFiguring out how to build ethical autonomous machines is one of the thorniest challenges in artificial intelligence today,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bonnefon, of France's Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, and his colleagues wrote in the study. The scenario described above is hypothetical, but it and others like it are bound to happen in real life once driverless cars become a mainstream reality, the researchers said. We need answers and rules now, so that we can include them in the programming of these machines. Even if a driverless car has a manual override option, it's easy to imagine a situation where there simply isn't time for a passenger to react and take control of the vehicle. Advertisement It can be unnerving to think about this stuff. But autonomous vehicles actually have the potential to create a safer world. In the United States alone, about 35,000 traffic deaths occur every year , along with millions of injuries. \u201cAround 90 percent of those accidents are due to human error,\" Azim Shariff, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine, and a co-author of the study, said at a press conference. \"Autonomous vehicles promise to change all that for the better, but there are barriers to their wide adoption. A number of those are technological barriers, but they\u2019re also psychological ones.\" If you've ever taken an ethics class, you might recognize the driverless-car scenario described above. It shares a lot of DNA with a famous thought experiment known as the trolley problem . In that scenario, you are the engineer of a runaway trolley. On the track ahead of you, five workers are working, oblivious to your approach. You can't brake, but you can switch the trolley onto another track. But there's one person on that track. Would you kill that one worker to save five others? Advertisement There are a number of variations on the question. What if that one person is pregnant? What if the five others are criminals? You can imagine how many different ways this can go. For the study published Thursday, the researchers conducted six online surveys of U.S. residents between June and November 2015, asking participants how they would want their autonomous cars to behave in various scenarios. The researchers tweaked some variables, such as the number of pedestrians or passengers, in each scenario. In some examples, participants had to imagine their child was riding in the car. In others, they were told to imagine riding with their coworkers. People generally preferred decisions that minimized the number of casualties. In one scenario, 76 percent of respondents said it would be more moral for an autonomous vehicle to sacrifice one passenger if it would save 10 pedestrians. Advertisement But this allegiance to the greater good only went so far. People balked when asked if they would purchase these cars themselves. \u201cYou can recognize the feeling,\" Bonnefon said -- it's \"the feeling that I want other people to do something, but it would be great not to do it myself.\" What should the manufacturers of driverless cars do? And what would happen to public safety if every driverless car was programmed to protect its passengers above all else? \"To maximize safety, people want to live in a world in which everybody owns driverless cars that minimize casualties, but they want their own car to protect them at all costs,\" said Iyad Rahwan, a researcher at MIT and co-author of the study. Advertisement Automakers that offer such cars would probably make a lot of money, Rahwan said. But it's the tragedy of the commons : \"If everybody thinks this way then we will end up in a world in which every car will look after its own passenger\u2019s safety and society as a whole is worse off.\" However, the researchers believe that public attitudes may change over time. If the technology of autonomous cars improves to the point where riding in them is ultimately safer than driving yourself, people might become more receptive to the idea of buying a car that increases their safety -- even if it's explicitly programmed to allow them to die in certain unlikely situations. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Top Science Publisher Failing Minority Groups, Industry Leaders Say Being more inclusive is not rocket science. By Kim Bellware Reporter, HuffPost Jul 27, 2015, 04:06 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Pamela Moore The world's largest professional organization for scientists has been feeding into \"harmful stereotypes\" about minority groups, including publishing sexist advice columns and transphobic cover photos , critics say. In an open letter sent last week to the prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science -- which is best known for publishing the well-regarded magazine Science and running career-advice site Science Careers -- 600 scientists and supporters called on the group to \"work more diligently to ensure that Science\u2019s web and printed material does not reinforce harmful stereotypes that hinder the advancement of underrepresented groups in [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] fields.\" Advertisement The letter, first obtained by BuzzFeed, suggests the AAAS should introduce diversity training for its editorial staffs and more closely monitor the comments sections of its online materials to weed out insensitive statements. Women battling sexism in science is perhaps the most visible issue, but Jennifer Glass, an assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and one of the letter's three main authors, told The Huffington Post it's important to note their concerns are \"not just a women's issue.\" \"This is a broader issue that STEM fields are, by-and-large, not currently welcoming career paths for under-represented groups, particularly people of color,\" Glass said. Advertisement Glass said telling minority groups that \"it's dangerous to speak out about these issues or advising them to wait until they reach a certain secure point in their careers to point out weaknesses in the system\" is an entrenched problem. Letter co-author Lenny Teytelman agreed that many people are hesitant to speak out about inequalities in the field, noting there's a concern within the scientific community that calling out issues like sexism might be seen as a distraction. \"If people think you\u2019re being a activist, they\u2019ll think you\u2019re not focusing on your research and they\u2019ll take your research less seriously,\" he said. Advertisement Teytelman said there needs to be a concerted effort to move more minorities into faculty positions and noted the field's culture of \"overwork\" -- which can be especially difficult for working parents -- needs to change. \"Scientists often have imposter syndrome, male or female,\" Teytelman said of the competitive, pressure-cooker environment that runs rampant in science fields. \"If I felt as a white guy having the questions of \u2018is this for me?' or 'am I committed enough?', I can only imagine what it\u2019s like if you\u2019re black or if you\u2019re a woman or someone trying to have kids, trying to breastfeed, trying to parent.\" In addition to recommendations made in the letter, Glass said career advice columns should include more work by people who are just starting out in their careers, particularly if they are in underrepresented groups. Advertisement \"Make space for them, share their stories, seek their opinions,\" Glass said. \"Social media networks are great places to find potential early career contributors who are already blogging and tweeting about these issues.\" \"People will generally not feel encouraged to pursue careers in fields where they don't have a voice and a community of allies,\" Glass added. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Marcia McNutt, the editor-in-chief of Science, told BuzzFeed the AAAS acknowledged it had room for improvement. Advertisement \"Science and Science Careers in particular have had a couple of missteps, which we regret,\" she said. \"We\u2019ve been rethinking our strategy and are in the process of changing oversight for Science Careers, but not fast enough.\" \"We all make mistakes,\" Teytelman said. \"I don\u2019t expect people to avoid mistakes, but what I pay attention to is how we avoid making them again.\" A culture change for the science community would be positive for the community as a whole, he added. \"There's a lot of strength in diversity and not pushing people out who want to be in it.\" Also on HuffPost: Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

How Living With Someone Makes Your Immune Systems Eerily Similar This is the first time anyone has compared the immune profiles of genetically unrelated people in a close relationship, scientists say. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Feb 26, 2016, 05:59 PM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Living with your partner can influence your immune system, new study suggests. Letizia McCall via Getty Images When you live with someone, it turns out that it can be way more intimate than just sharing space -- you can also end up having similar immune systems. A new study, published in the journal Nature Immunology last week, suggests that the cellular composition of our immune systems is partly shaped by who we live with as well as our age. Advertisement The research marks the first time that the immune systems of two unrelated individuals in a close relationship have been closely analyzed and compared, said Dr. Adrian Liston, a researcher at the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology in Belgium and a co-author of the study. \"We already knew that environmental factors can impact the immune system, so in that regard it should not be a surprise that people with similar environments have similar immune systems,\" Liston told The Huffington Post. \"But what was really surprising was the strength of the effect.\" For the study, the researchers monitored and analyzed the immune systems of about 670 people, ranging in age from 2 to 86, over a three-year period. Advertisement The researchers collected blood samples from each person and took a close look at the immune cells in each sample, New Scientist reported. After assessing each person's age, gender and weight, the researchers discovered that the individuals who lived together had surprisingly similar cellular compositions in their immune systems. \"We know multiple environmental factors can change the immune system \u2013 diet, alcohol, smoking, exercise, pollution, stress \u2013 and lot of these factors will be shared in couples,\" Liston said. Advertisement Furthermore, couples who lived together and shared a child had 50 percent more similar immune systems than seen in the wider population. \"The effect of cohabitation with a child was a more powerful influence on the immune system than 40 years of aging!\" Liston said. Liston said another factor that had a strong impact on the similarity of immune systems is the bacteria living in our guts. Advertisement \"We don\u2019t live in a sterile environment, so just living together means that we will have similar bacteria in our guts, again pushing our immune systems into a similar status,\" he said. \"Then if you are in a relationship, things will be even more similar. 80 million bacteria are transferred in a single kiss.\" This animation illustrates what happens to the immune systems of two individuals in a relationship. Their movements correspond to changes and variations in each immune system. Babraham Institute/YouTube (Animation produced by Dr Carl) What, then, would happen if a couple living together breaks up? Liston said that the scenario wasn't explored in the new study, but he would assume that each partner's immune systems would start to drift apart into new configurations. Advertisement The researchers concluded that we each have unique immune systems that can be influenced by age and our environment. \" We all have a stable immune landscape which is robustly maintained,\" Dr. Michelle Linterman, a researcher at the Babraham Institute in England and a co-author of the study, said in a statement. \"What is different between individuals is what our individual immune systems look like. ... Our study has shown that age is a major influence on what our immune landscapes look like, which is probably one of the reasons why there is a declining response to vaccination and reduced resistance to infection in older persons.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So, according to the researchers, something as simple as changing our immediate environments can cause profound changes in our immune systems, which impact our risk of developing auto-immune diseases, allergies, cancers, and many other health concerns. Advertisement \"The bad news is that 25 percent of the variation [in our immune systems] is caused by our genetics, so there is not much to do there. The good news is that 75 percent is not genetic,\" Liston said. \"If we can predict exactly how each environmental factor alters the immune system, we might end up being able to reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases by approaches as simple as altering diet or sleeping patterns.\" Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip Advertisement From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

All 5 Bright Planets To Be Visible From Earth At The Same Time Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter will align for first time in a decade. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Jan 17, 2016, 10:49 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT The solar system is all set to give a rare celestial show. Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter will all be visible from Earth when they appear in a diagonal row before dawn on Wednesday, Jan. 20. It's the first time the five bright planets , so called as they can usually be seen easily with the naked eye, have aligned in such a way in more than 10 years, reports EarthSky.org. The phenomenon will continue every early morning until Feb. 20. \" Essentially a quirk of the universe ,\" Dr. Alan Duffy, a research fellow at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia, told Australian Geographic about the formation. And with the five planets on different yearly cycles, he added their alignment was \"something well worth seeing.\" Advertisement Jupiter will rise first , followed by the red-tinted Mars, golden-looking Saturn, brightest planet Venus and lastly Mercury. Exact timings will vary each day and depend on where you are located. The Washington Post reports that, if you look south from D.C. before dawn on Sunday, Jan. 24, then Mercury will be closest to the eastern horizon, while Jupiter will loiter in the west-southwest. But don't panic, there are a host of stargazing apps to help you figure out exactly where to look and which planet is which. Just hope it's not cloudy. Advertisement The order of the planets and dwarf planet Pluto from the Sun can be easily remembered with the mnemonic, \"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas.\" Steve Allen/Getty Images The waning moon will also sweep past the planets from Jan. 27 to Feb. 6, according to the Coachella Valley Independent. Astronomers last got the chance to see the planets in a similar line-up between Dec. 15, 2004 and Jan. 15, 2005. Advertisement The next time the planets align is predicted to be in the evening sky from Aug. 13 to 19, according to EarthSky.org, but Mercury and Venus will sit low and not be easily seen from the northern hemisphere.

Dione Crosses Saturn's Disk In Spectacular New Image The photo was captured from approximately 1.4 million miles away. By Steven Hoffer Reporter, HuffPost Sep 3, 2015, 01:33 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A view of one of Saturn's moons, Dione, passing the planet. Credit: NASA NASA has released an incredible new image showing one of Saturn's many moons crossing the planet's disk. The moon Dione, named for the Greek goddess Dione, can be seen in the image above, which was captured by the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 21. Advertisement The technical specifications are quite amazing. \"The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.4 million miles from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 119 degrees,\" according to NASA . \"Image scale is 9 miles per pixel.\" Here are some additional details about Dione, from Space.com : At 696 miles in diameter, Dione is the fourth-largest of Saturn's sixty-odd moons ; only Titan, Rhea and Iapetus are bigger. Parts of Dione are heavily cratered, and the satellite's trailing side features mysterious ice cliffs and fractures that run for tens or hundreds of kilometers. Cassini has also detected a wispy oxygen atmosphere surrounding the frigid moon. No additional close fly-bys of Dione are planned for the Cassini spacecraft. Dione was first discovered by Giovanni Cassini in 1684.

Posted by Houston Zoo on Friday, January 15, 2016 Leaf-cutter ants make mincemeat of rose clippings in fascinating time lapse footage posted online. The tiny critters at Houston Zoo in Texas completely destroy the plant's pretty pink flowers, green leaves and stems. \" It took our leaf-cutter ants almost 5 hours to break down these rose clippings ,\" zoo staff posted to Facebook on Friday. \"But it will only take you 1 minute to see the magic!\" Advertisement Leaf-cutter ants are principally found in the southwest of the U.S. and South and Central America. Credit: Mark Bowler via Getty Images Leaf-cutter ants, principally found in the southwest of the U.S. and South and Central America, don't eat the plant detritus they collect, the BBC reports. Instead, they take it to underground farms in the wild to let fungus grow over the segments. They then consume the fungus.

World's Brightest X-Ray Laser Is Getting A Big Upgrade This will help with the development of new technologies and life-saving drugs in the future, scientists say. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Apr 6, 2016, 04:45 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT The brightest X-ray laser in the world is undergoing a major upgrade. The Linac Coherent Light Source, the world\u2019s first very-high-energy X-ray electron laser , launched at the Department of Energy\u2019s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in 2009. Ever since, the record-breaking laser has given us an unprecedented glimpse of how things happen on the atomic level -- from chemical reactions to the strange behavior of electrons to how deadly diseases attack. Soon enough, however, scientists working with the laser may be able to do much, much more. Advertisement Construction is underway at the Stanford University-based laboratory to build an even brighter laser that will work in parallel with the existing LCLS. Each laser will occupy about one-third of the lab's 2-mile-long linear accelerator tunnel. They will shoot off rapid-fire beams to capture detailed glimpses of structures and reactions in quadrillionths of a second, The Washington Post reported . The $1 billion project, called LCLS-II , is described in a stunning new video (above) that was posted to YouTube on Monday. Advertisement \"LCLS-II will take X-ray science to the next level, opening the door to a whole new range of studies of the ultrafast and ultrasmall,\" Dr. Mike Dunne, director of LCLS at Stanford University, said in a statement . \"This will tremendously advance our ability to develop transformative technologies of the future, including novel electronics, life-saving drugs and innovative energy solutions.\" The future LCLS-II X-ray laser alongside the existing LCLS. LCLS uses the last third of the lab's 2-mile-long linear accelerator. LCLS-II will use the first third. SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory How would LCLS-II work? Just like the existing LCLS, it will generate beams of extremely bright X-ray laser light by using the energy of electrons accelerated to nearly the speed of light. Advertisement Unlike LCLS, however, LCLS-II will include a superconducting accelerator to propel electrons through a series of cavities, resulting in an almost continuous X-ray laser beam with pulses that are 10,000 times brighter, on average, than those of LCLS. It will be capable of creating up to 1 million X-ray flashes per second. LCLS, meanwhile, uses a copper accelerator that operates at room temperature and allows for the generation of 120 X-ray pulses per second. It will be understandable if it makes the LCLS look like a jealous older sibling. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Here's What's Next For NASA's New Horizons Spacecraft The craft could flyby another amazing object as soon as January 1st. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Sep 2, 2015, 08:21 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT An artist's impression of NASA's New Horizons spacecraft encountering a Pluto-like object in the distant Kuiper belt. NASA Two months after the New Horizon's spacecraft nailed the Pluto flyby, it's setting its sights on something new: a tiny icy object that sits in the asteroid belt past the dwarf planet. NASA's goal is to gather as much data as possible about this Kuiper Belt object (KBO), called 2014 MU69, while using fuel sparingly. Advertisement \"This KBO costs less fuel to reach [than other candidate targets], leaving more fuel for the flyby, for ancillary science, and greater fuel reserves to protect against the unforeseen,\" Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, said in a press release. Stern said that 2014 MU69, identified as a good candidate with the help of Hubble telescope , is an ideal flyby target because of what it can teach us about the origins of the Kuiper Belt. At 100th of the size of Pluto, just 30 miles across, this KBO is likely similar to the building blocks that are thought to have come together to create the dwarf planet and other larger objects in the Belt. \u201cThe detailed images and other data that New Horizons could obtain from a KBO flyby will revolutionize our understanding of the Kuiper Belt and KBOs,\u201dsaid New Horizons team member John Spencer. Advertisement The craft will make four maneuvers toward the small icy object in late October and early November and could reach 2014 MU69 as early as January 1.

One Dead After Rockfall On Yosemite's Famed El Capitan Another climber was injured on the near-vertical slope. By Nick Visser Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sep 27, 2017, 08:48 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT One person died and another was injured Wednesday after a rockfall on a popular climbing route in Yosemite National Park, the National Park Service said . The incident was reported on El Capitan , a granite monolith that rises straight up about 3,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada of California. The NPS said a rockfall of \u201cundetermined size\u201d occurred about 1:55 p.m. local time, and park rangers and search and rescue personnel were at the scene. Happened at 1:52pm pic.twitter.com/j7Vo0XwR67 \u2014 Jon Kameen (@JonKameen) September 27, 2017 Advertisement \u201cThe release point appears to be near the \u2018Waterfall Route,\u2019 a popular climbing route on the East Buttress of El Capitan,\u201d the park service said. \u201cThis is the climbing season in Yosemite National Park and there are many climbers on El Capitan and other climbing routes in the park.\u201d Park rangers were working to get one injured person to medical care. The NPS did not identify the victim or injured person on Wednesday. Ryan Sheridan, a climber, posted a photo to Facebook with a comment that said the fall \u201cdoesn\u2019t look good\u201d and that \u201cone person walked out of the debris.\u201d Advertisement Comments on a rock climbing forum said the fall \u201clooked like a sheet of rock about 100 feet square.\u201d The NPS reported a subsequent rock fall off El Capitan on Thursday afternoon that resulted in a road closure. No new deaths or injuries were reported from the slide, and Yosemite remained open. This story has been updated with reports of an additional rockfall on Thursday.

Scientists Note Asteroid Approaching Earth Looks Like It\u2019s Wearing A Face Mask 1998 OR2 appears to know the planet is facing the coronavirus pandemic, researchers joked. By Josephine Harvey Assignment Editor, HuffPost Apr 26, 2020, 09:08 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Scientists are joking that even an asteroid set to pass by Earth is exercising caution as the planet tackles the coronavirus pandemic. The 1998 OR2 asteroid poses no risk to the Earth, but its appearance makes it look as though it were aware of the risks on the planet right now, according to researchers at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, who quipped that its shape resembles a face mask. Advertisement \u201cThe small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,\u201d says Anne Virkki, head of Planetary Radar at the observatory, according to a press release. \u201cBut since we are all thinking about COVID-19 these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.\u201d The asteroid is classified as a \u201cPotentially Hazardous Object (PHO),\u201d which means it\u2019s more than 500 feet in diameter and will come within 5 million miles of Earth\u2019s orbit. Researchers estimate this asteroid is roughly 1.2 miles across in size and will still be 16 times farther than the distance to the moon when it comes closest to Earth. Advertisement Range-Doppler radar image of asteroid 1998 OR2. Arecibo Observatory/NASA/NSF A team of experts at Arecibo Observatory monitors these and other types of near-Earth asteroids, and use their observations to predict the trajectories of future PHOs. The University of Central Florida, which manages the National Science Foundation facility, teased on Twitter that the asteroid \u201cappears to know our planet is facing a pandemic.\u201d Advertisement Astroid in the Earth's neighborhood? \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc40 The @NAICobservatory in Puerto Rico is following an asteroid approaching Earth this week and while it poses no threat, it appears to know our planet is facing a pandemic \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/pF7FbT3NCU \u2014 UCF (@UCF) April 24, 2020 While the asteroid poses no immediate danger to Earth, researchers say it will approach closer to the planet next time it passes by. It\u2019s key, therefore, to study these types of objects in order to improve risk mitigation technologies, they said. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Neil deGrasse Tyson Destroys Climate Change Deniers' Favorite Argument In 1 Tweet BOOM! By Ed Mazza Deputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost Sep 11, 2017, 02:44 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING A go-to argument from science deniers was absolutely crushed by one of the world\u2019s most famous scientists. Some believe one reason for the consensus that human activity has caused climate change is that scientists are in cahoots with each other . But Neil deGrasse Tyson , the astrophysicist, author and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, highlighted the biggest flaw in that logic in a tweet he fired off on Sunday: Advertisement Anyone who thinks scientists like agreeing with one another has never attended a scientific conference. \u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) September 10, 2017 Tyson has tackled the issue before. Just last month, he said that no one denied the solar eclipse, which was predicted by science. \u201cI don\u2019t see people objecting to it. I don\u2019t see people in denial of it. Yet methods and tools of science predict it,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d \u201cSo when methods and tools of science predict other things, to have people turn around and say, \u2018I deny what you say,\u2019 there\u2019s something wrong in our world when that happens .\u201d Advertisement Earlier this year, Tyson also warned that America\u2019s growing rejection of science was \u201c the beginning of the end of an informed democracy. \u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed that the country that I grew up in \u2015 that put men on the moon, that developed the internet, that invented personal computers and smartphones \u2015 that people are debating what is and what is not scientifically true.\u201d A 2013 analysis of climate research found that that 97 percent of peer-reviewed papers that took a position on the issue endorsed the consensus view that human activity was causing climate change.

What A Dust Devil Looks Like On Mars The image really is out of this world. By Lee Moran Reporter, HuffPost Apr 4, 2016, 05:34 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT A dust devil has been photographed swirling on Mars. NASA's Opportunity rover captured the astonishing image in the red planet's Meridiani Planum region. The space agency posted the picture on Facebook on Sunday: \" This is one of the best dust devils that we have seen in Meridiani Planum,\" Opportunity's deputy principal investigator Ray Arvidson told Mashable. \" We are lucky to have captured this one in an image!\" According to NASA, dust devils on Mars form the same way they do in deserts on Earth.

Here's What Happens When A CD Shatters Into Smithereens In Slow-Motion A CD Shattering Into Smithereens Is Surprisingly Stunning By Macrina Cooper-White Associate Science Editor, The Huffington Post Mar 29, 2015, 10:49 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT With streaming music and digital downloads taking over, what to do with old CDs? Use them in a science experiment, of course! Gavin Free and Dan Gruchy, also known as \" The Slow-Mo Guys ,\" have done just that -- spinning CDs at high speeds and capturing in slow-mo the incredible moment when they shattered. Just check out the video above. Advertisement (Story continues below GIF). The duo used a vacuum motor to get one of the discs spinning at a speed of 23,000 RPM -- and then used an ultra-high-speed camera to film the CD explosion at a rate of 170,000 frames-per-second. \"That's the fastest thing we've ever filmed,\" Gruchy says in the video, \"and the fastest frame rate as well.\" 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The Case For Sharing All Of America's Data On Mosquitoes The Case For Sharing All Of America's Data On Mosquitoes By The Atlantic, Contributor Exploring the American idea since 1857 Exploring the American idea since 1857 Aug 29, 2017, 09:44 AM EDT This post was published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor platform.

LEAVE A COMMENT Christophe Simon / Getty By Ed Yong For decades, agencies around the United States have been collecting data on mosquitoes. Biologists set traps, dissect captured insects, and identify which species they belong to. They\u2019ve done this for millions of mosquitoes, creating an unprecedented trove of information \u2014 easily one of the biggest long-term attempts to monitor any group of animals, if not the very biggest. The problem, according to Micaela Elvira Martinez from Princeton University and Samuel Rund from the University of Notre Dame, is that this treasure trove of data isn\u2019t all in the same place, and only a small fraction of it is public. The rest is inaccessible, hoarded by local mosquito-control agencies around the country. Advertisement Currently, these agencies can use their data to check if their attempts to curtail mosquito populations are working. Are they doing enough to remove stagnant water, for example? Do they need to spray pesticides? But if they shared their findings, Martinez and Rund say that scientists could do much more. They could better understand the ecology of these insects, predict the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue fever or Zika, coordinate control efforts across states and counties, and quickly spot the arrival of new invasive species. RELATED: How the Rise of Cities Helped Mosquitoes Thrive That\u2019s why Martinez and Rund are now calling for the creation of a national database of mosquito records that anyone can access. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of taxpayer investment and human effort that goes into setting traps, checking them weekly, dissecting all those mosquitoes under a microscope, and tabulating the data,\u201d says Martinez. \u201cIt would be a big bang for our buck to collate all that data and make it available.\u201d Martinez is a disease modeler \u2014 someone who uses real-world data to build simulations that reveal how infections rise, spread and fall. She typically works with childhood diseases like measles and polio, where researchers are almost spoiled for data. Physicians are legally bound to report any cases, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiles and publishes this information as a weekly report. Advertisement The same applies to cases of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and Zika, but not to populations of the insects themselves. So, during last year\u2019s Zika epidemic, when Martinez wanted to study the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the disease, she had a tough time. \u201cI was really surprised that I couldn\u2019t find data on Aedes aegypti numbers,\u201d she says. Her colleagues explained that scientists use climate variables like temperature and humidity to predict where mosquitoes are going to be abundant. That seemed ludicrous to her, especially since organizations collect information on the actual insects. It\u2019s just that no one ever gathers those figures together. RELATED: Shazam for Mosquitoes Together with Rund and a team of undergraduate students, she found that there are more than 1,000 separate agencies in the United States that collect mosquito data \u2014 at least one in every county or jurisdiction. Only 152 agencies make their data publicly available in some way. The team collated everything they could find since 2009, and ended up with information about more than 15 million mosquitoes. Imagine what they\u2019d have if all the datasets were open, especially since some go back decades. \u201cA few mosquito-related databases do exist, but none are quite right.\u201d Advertisement A few mosquito-related databases do exist, but none are quite right. ArboNET, which is managed by the CDC and state health departments, mainly stores data about mosquito-borne diseases, and whatever information it has on the insects themselves isn\u2019t precise enough in either time or space to be useful for modeling. MosquitoNET, which was developed by the CDC, does track mosquitoes, but \u201cit\u2019s a completely closed system, and hardly anyone has access to it,\u201d says Rund. The Smithsonian Institution\u2019s VectorMap is better in that it\u2019s accessible, \u201cbut it lacks any real-time data from the continental United States,\u201d says Rund. \u201cWhen I checked a few months ago, it had just one record of Aedes aegypti since 2013.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why we came up with this idea of a national surveillance system,\u201d Martinez says. \u201cThe U.S. government should make it a requirement for mosquito-control boards to send in their data.\u201d RELATED: The Quest to Make a Better Mosquito Repellent Some scientists who work on mosquito control apparently disagree, and negative reviews have stopped Martinez and Rund from publishing their ideas in prominent academic journals. (For now, they\u2019ve uploaded a paper describing their vision to the preprint repository bioRxiv.) \u201cSome control boards say: What if people want to sue us because we\u2019re showing that they have mosquito vectors near their homes, or if their house prices go down?\u201d says Martinez. \u201cAnd one mosquito-control scientist told me that no one should be able to work with mosquito data unless they\u2019ve gone out and trapped mosquitoes themselves.\u201d Advertisement Other scientists aren\u2019t convinced that collating the data would be useful. \u201cTo predict an outbreak, a national database would be of no use,\u201d says Lyle Petersen , who directs the CDC\u2019s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. \u201cMosquito density is very, very local. Knowing what\u2019s going on with mosquitoes in California isn\u2019t going to help you with what\u2019s going on in Illinois. The data from even one part of a city may be totally irrelevant to another.\u201d Micah Hahn , an epidemiologist at the University of Alaska Anchorage, feels differently. She says that a national mosquito database \u201cwould be extremely useful for public health-planning and emergency response\u201d\u2014but creating one would be a logistical nightmare. \u201cThere are hundreds to thousands of independently operating vector-control units \u2014 some not more than a guy and truck in rural areas \u2014 with varying levels of human resources and computer savvy,\u201d she says. They vary in which traps and baits they use, whether they count males as well as females, and whether they identify insects down to the species or genus. Merging such disparate data would be hard, and there\u2019s no quality-control system in place for checking it. Advertisement Roxanne Connelly , an entomologist at the University of Florida, agrees. \u201cAs a researcher, I\u2019d love to have access to a nation-wide mosquito surveillance database and have often wished for such a system in Florida,\u201d she says. But after 17 years of experience, she thinks that \u201ctrying to standardize the data, for the past or in for future, is going to be almost impossible.\u201d Martinez agrees that this is the biggest obstacle to creating the database of her dreams \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t see it as a deal-breaker. She and Rund argue that many states have already taken steps toward building open databases. Iowa, for example, makes all its mosquito data freely available . \u201cAt a minimum we are advocating for stringing these systems together,\u201d they say. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Drunk Settlers To Blame For Aussie Accent, Lecturer Says It's a highly controversial theory among other academics. By Eliza Sankar-Gorton Science Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Nov 1, 2015, 11:30 AM EST LEAVE A COMMENT Scientists have long known that the modern Australian accent developed from a combination of European settlers' and Aborigines' pronunciations -- but a provocative new theory claims the accent may also have boozy origins. Dean Frenkel, a speech and communications lecturer at Victoria University, wrote an opinion piece this week in Melbourne daily newspaper The Age arguing that the Australian accent was heavily influenced by the drunken slurs of the country's original settlers. Advertisement \"Our forefathers regularly got drunk together and through their frequent interactions unknowingly added an alcoholic slur to our national speech patterns,\" he wrote. \"Missing consonants can include missing 't's (Impordant), 'l;s (Austraya) and 's's (yesh), while many of our vowels are lazily transformed into other vowels,\" he explains in the piece. \"If we all received communication training, Australia would become a cleverer country.\" Frenkel's piece swiftly drew criticism from linguistics researchers, as there currently doesn't seem to be evidence to support it. Advertisement \"There is no evidence that alcohol consumption has any long-term effect on one's own language, let alone transgenerational language transmission,\" Aidan Wilson, a Ph.D. candidate in linguistics at the University of Melbourne, told The Huffington Post. Dr. Rob Pensalfini, a senior lecturer in languages and cultures at the University of Queensland, compared the theory to other accent-origin ideas that don't have scientific backing. \"They say New Yorkers have nasal voices because they have to cut through the noise of the traffic,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Company. \"The original [joke] for Australia was we speak in a slurred and closed-lip way to keep the flies out of their mouths. ... They're all completely baseless [and] I want to see the evidence, I want to see the instrumental valuations.\" Advertisement The Australian accent is a relatively new dialect of English , as it's just over 200 years old. Though many scientists disagree with Frenkel's theory, some residents of Australia seem to be responding more lightly : Apparently Aussie accent origin is based on drunk settlers #Iwilldrinktothat \u2014 TwittyKate (@HereKityKate) October 28, 2015 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

How Educators Are Starting To Embrace The Concept Of 'Good Screen Time' Video games may not be all bad, and actually could help kids learn about science. By Jacqueline Howard Senior Science Editor, The Huffington Post Jul 26, 2015, 08:48 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT Mike Simons via Getty Images Video games have a bad reputation among many parents and teachers, who worry that too much screen time is bad for children. There's no doubt that some kids go overboard -- and those who do can face troubling health risks. But a body of research suggests that playing digital games can have psychological and even physical benefits -- from increasing players' \"brain flexibility\" to possibly improving eyesight . And new offerings from game makers like Leapfrog , National Geographic , Amplify Games and Galxyz may further assuage parents and teachers' fears. Advertisement \"There is a developing notion of good screen time versus bad screen time,\" said Osman Rashid, founder and CEO of Galxyz, a game maker in Los Altos, California. \"Good screen time\" can include using games that make players strategize, analyze and think quickly, he said, while bad screen time generally involves doing something more passive, like watching a video. Rashid, who has two daughters, was disappointed there weren't more games he felt both entertained and challenged kids. \"Most learning games had shoddy graphics, poorly developed interfaces and fake gaming,\" he said. So Rashid set out to create one that would teach players about science -- and actually appeal to kids. Advertisement Galxyz games can help kids learn about a variety of disciplines, from physical and life science to Earth and space science, and the company recently partnered with the New York Academy of Sciences to help deliver a new educational product. Kids can play these games at home, or the programs can be incorporated into a teacher's syllabus. Fifty-five percent of educators surveyed by the Games and Learning Publishing Council last year said their students played games in their classrooms at least once a week. Rashid noted he appreciates seeing teachers realizing educational games won't necessarily replace them and that certain programs can actually enhance lesson plans. Advertisement But since educational gaming is a relatively new concept, scientists still lack a solid understanding of how educational screen time affects children and learning outcomes. There's little data on the long-term effects of using education games, and scientists who research gaming don't have a consistent working definition of \"educational games,\" Dr. Vic Strasburger, a University of New Mexico pediatrician and a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, told The Huffington Post. However, he added, finding new ways to engage students is generally beneficial. \"If you're going to stand up in front of a class and give a lecture for 40 minutes, you're going to be like a stand-up comedian who dies on stage,\" he said. \"Teachers need to use new technology to amuse, entertain and educate their students, because their students are used to being amused and entertained.\" Advertisement Go to Homepage LEAVE A COMMENT Suggest a correction | Submit a tip From Our Partner From Our Partner HuffPost Shopping's Best Finds ON THIS DAY IN HUFFPOST HISTORY FAIR, FEARLESS REPORTING SINCE 2005 Support HuffPost Newsletter Sign Up The Morning Email Wake up to the day's most important news.

Blue Origin Rocket Sticks Third Landing Test Founder Jeff Bezos hails the launch and landing as \"perfect.\" Eric M. Johnson Apr 4, 2016, 08:51 AM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Jeff Bezos' space transportation company Blue Origin successfully launched and landed for the third time a suborbital rocket capable of carrying six passengers, taking another step on its path in developing reusable boosters, the company said on Saturday. The New Shepard rocket and capsule blasted off from a launch site in West Texas on Saturday at an undisclosed time, and landed minutes later back at a landing pad, the company said. The capsule, which was flying autonomously, parachuted to a nearby site and was recovered, the company said. Advertisement \"Perfect booster landing,\" Bezos wrote on Twitter. Blue Origin declined to comment on the test but said on Twitter, \"Congrats Blue team on today's (flight)!\" Saturday's flight marks the third successful launch-and-land for the rocket, with similar missions completed in January and November. Bezos, the founder of Amazon .com Inc ( AMZN.O ), said earlier this month that Blue Origin expects to begin crewed test flights of the New Shepard next year and begin flying paying passengers as early as 2018. Advertisement Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX are among a handful of companies working to develop rockets that can fly themselves back to Earth so they can be refurbished and flown again, potentially slashing launch costs. For now, Blue Origin is flying suborbital rockets, which lack the speed to put spacecraft into orbit around Earth. 20 Years Of Free Journalism Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

NASA Astronaut Peggy Whitson Has Spent A Record-Breaking 665 Days In Space The 57-year-old trailblazer returned from her third mission to the International Space Station on Saturday. By Dominique Mosbergen Senior Reporter, HuffPost Sep 3, 2017, 01:06 PM EDT LEAVE A COMMENT LOADING ERROR LOADING Peggy Whitson returned to Earth on Saturday with an out-of-this-world record under her belt. After spending 288 days at the International Space Station on her latest mission, the NASA astronaut and biochemist has clocked more cumulative hours in space than any other American in history and any other woman on Earth. Whitson has now spent a total of 665 days in space, including two previous ISS missions in 2002 and 2007-2008. Her space endurance record far surpasses the previous NASA record of 534 days, which was set by astronaut Jeff Williams last year. Advertisement Globally, she\u2019s now ranked eighth for the most amount of time spent in space. Russia\u2019s Fyodor Yurchikhin, a cosmonaut who returned from the ISS with Whitson on Saturday, is in the seventh spot with 673 days in space. The top place belongs to another Russian, Gennady Padalka, who has spent 879 days off of Earth .
